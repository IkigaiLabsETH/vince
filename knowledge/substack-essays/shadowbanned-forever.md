I used to reach a hundred million people. Not hype, not vanity metrics — literal, audited, third-party verified eyeballs across a decade of work. Three hundred thousand impressions a week was a slow Tuesday on LIVETHELIFETV (FB era).

I started fresh on twitter in 2007. Then the account got nuked during C19. After months of begging, pulling strings, and sending a dozen desperate appeals, Twitter quietly unlocked it, too late. The audience was scattered, the momentum gone. I walked away and started fresh with IKIGAILABS.

## Context

Two years and almost twenty thousand tweets later, every post on this “new” account dies at three views. Sometimes two. Once, in a fit of cosmic comedy, seven. Same person. Same voice. Same refusal to stay quiet about lockdowns, mandates, and the machine that sold them. Different account. Same graveyard.

Welcome to the permanent shadowban, now with 100 % fewer legacy followers and 0 % mercy. You are not paranoid. You are not washed. You are one of tens of thousands of small accounts posting into a vacuum so complete it feels curated.

The crying cat holding the phone is no longer feels like a meme; it feels like surveillance footage.

## Main

The Data Doesn’t Lie 

In the last ninety days I searched X for variations of “small account zero engagement,” “3 views,” “shadowban still,” and “reach died.” 

The platform returned thousands of recent posts. The pattern is identical:

- 
Accounts under 10 k followers averaging 0–40 impressions per tweet

- 
Sudden cliffs after political or “sensitive” posts (C19, … you name it)

- 
Premium badge or no Premium badge — same graveyard

- 
Posts that once reached 50 k now reach 200, …

The most liked complaint I found (289 000 views, naturally) came from a user with 5 000 followers lamenting that small accounts get “basically zero engagement.” The second-most liked complaint had 8 views. 

The irony writes itself.

Third-party analytics firms quietly updated their 2025 reports: organic reach on X for non-verified accounts is now 1.7 % of followers on a good day. On a bad day — and most days are bad — it is statistically indistinguishable from zero.

**This Is Not Entropy. This Is Policy.**

Elon Musk famously said “freedom of speech, not freedom of reach.” Fair enough. But what he never advertised was that reach would be rationed by an invisible credit score built on compliance, verification status, reply ratios, and — crucially — how often you annoyed the wrong people in 2021.

The Twitter Files proved that governments, NGOs, and intelligence-adjacent contractors maintained real-time denylists. Musk swore he ended that era. Yet here we are in 2025 and the accounts that appear on those old denylists — anti-lockdown doctors, skeptics of the 2020 narrative, parents who spoke at school boards — remain throttled to single digits. The flags never came off. They just stopped being called flags.

You can test it yourself tonight. Log out. Search your exact username plus a unique phrase from your last ten tweets. If nothing appears in “Latest,” congratulations: you have achieved digital solitary confinement while still being allowed to talk to the walls.

**So Why Haven’t I Deleted My 2007 Account?**

Because deleting it would feel like burning my own diary. Because my partner still reads every post and that alone justifies the account’s existence. Because eighteen years of my life live in that blue timeline, and X is still the only place that keeps the whole thread intact. Because spite is a renewable resource.

I now treat the platform exactly like a locked journal that happens to be written in public. No performance pressure. No link begging. No “engagement farming.” 

I post as if no one will ever see it except the one person who matters. Paradoxically, that mindset has made the experience bearable, almost peaceful.

But peace is not the same as fairness.

If you are reading this on Substack, you already know the exodus is real. Thousands of us have quietly rebuilt audiences elsewhere while leaving our X corpses propped up in the chair, still typing into the dark.

There is no shame in leaving. There is also no shame in staying if the act of writing — even into a void — still feels like oxygen.

I will keep the @ handle I registered when Twitter was seventy employees and a whale. I will keep posting the way monks once copied manuscripts: not for fame, but because the text must survive the empire that wants it erased.

But I will no longer measure my worth in impressions. I will no longer refresh the analytics tab like a gambler waiting for the machine to pay out. I have moved the audience that still cares here, to Substack, to Telegram, to quiet Discords and email lists where the algorithm cannot follow.

The crying cat can keep the phone. 

I’m done staring at the screen waiting for it to love me back.

## Conclusion

If you’re in the same graveyard, come find me somewhere the sun still let small accounts breathe. Bring your archives. Bring your spite. Bring whatever is left of the voice they tried to bury.

We outlived one internet. We can outlive this one too.
