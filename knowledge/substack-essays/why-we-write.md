Santi’s tweet hit like a red candle to the gut: 

“Everyone writes more as prices go down.” 

## Context

And damn if it isn’t true.

Green candles? We’re all too busy stacking sats, refreshing charts, and quietly grinning at our portfolios. Silence reigns—euphoric, smug silence. Red candles? Thinkpiece season opens. Threads explode. Newsletters drop. Everyone suddenly has profound insights on macro, on-chain metrics, HODLing philosophy, and why this dip is actually the best buying opportunity ever. 

We laugh because we’ve all been there. 

## Main

Hell, we even drafted this defense of writing... right in the middle of a bleed.

Guilty as charged.

Yet, it remains one of the most profound ways to survive the chaos. We write not just to vent, but to process the madness, preserve our sanity, connect with fellow sufferers, rally the troops, and—let’s be real—sharpen our edge for the next cycle.

**Writing to Think (Through the Pain)**

Bear markets are a mental battlefield: FUD everywhere, half-baked theories flying, your portfolio mocking you daily. When prices tank, we commit those swirling doubts to the page—forcing clarity amid the fog.

Articulating why “this time is different” (or isn’t) demands rigor. You wrestle contradictions, expose your own biases, and refine shaky convictions.

As Joan Didion said, “I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking.” In a dip? That’s when we need it most—turning panic into perspective.

**Writing to Remember (The Lessons)**

Crypto moves fast: ATHs blur into corrections, hype cycles repeat. But red seasons etch deep scars. Writing anchors those moments—timestamping the fear, the greed, the “I told you so” regrets.

It’s our personal ledger: a snapshot of who we were when we bought the top or sold the bottom. Revisiting old threads years later? Pure gold—cringing at past naivety or nodding at timeless wisdom.

In a world of fleeting pumps and endless scrolls, writing preserves the narrative. It ensures we don’t forget the cycles, turning transient pain into enduring alpha.

**Writing to Connect (In the Trenches)**

Bull markets? Everyone’s “building” in silence, chasing gains solo.

Bears? We flock together. A thoughtful thread vanishes into the void most times, but when it hits—boom. Strangers bond over shared despair, swap coping strategies, form unbreakable communities.

Thinking aloud in public invites the chorus: replies, quotes, DMs from like-minded degens. In fragmented markets, writing weaves empathy—reminding us we’re not alone in the drawdown.

**Writing to Lead (And Cope)**

True influence shines in downturns: giving voice to the unease others feel but can’t articulate. Distill the macro mess into clear narratives—why rates matter, why adoption still grinds forward—and watch it spread.

In bears, your words become lifelines: framing the dip as opportunity, rallying conviction. The best leaders don’t just predict the bottom; they arm the community with better mental models.

**Writing to Feel (And Develop Taste)**

Red markets force choices: hold or fold? Narrative or noise? Writing hones discernment—picking words that resonate, tones that cut through despair, details that matter. It builds taste: distinguishing signal from FUD, authenticity from grift. Endless revisions teach resilience, turning emotional volatility into refined expression.

**The Timeless Act of Bear Market Writing**

In a space that rewards speed and leverage, slowing down to write during dips is rebellion—a commitment to depth when everyone’s distracted by pain.

Green candles bring silence and profits. Red ones? They birth the best content, the strongest communities, the sharpest minds.

## Conclusion

So yeah, we write more as prices go down. It’s not just coping—it’s evolving.

Pick up the keyboard next bleed. Transform the drawdown... and come out stronger on the other side. There. Defended. Now back to staring at the charts.
