My phone’s buzzing with another doomscroll notification—some X thread declaring NFTs officially six feet under—and I’m just sitting here, rubbing my eyes, wondering if I should laugh or cry. Here’s the deal. Back in that fever-dream March of 2021, this dude Beeple—real name Mike Winkelmann, but who cares—slaps his “Everydays” collage onto the blockchain and hauls in $69 million at Christie’s. I remember it like yesterday: I’m hunched over my ancient MacBook, refreshing feeds, thinking, “Shit, is this it? Art’s finally gone rogue.”

Suddenly, every pixelated monkey and glitchy doodle was an “asset.” We were all gonna be millionaires, right? Cut to now, late 2025, and Beeple’s still out there, dabbling in AI and gracing MoMA’s fancy blockchain exhibit. Good for him. But the rest of the NFT scene? It’s like waking up after a three-day bender—head pounding, wallet empty, and everyone’s whispering “it’s over.”

## Context

Sales? Tanked. X is a graveyard of “down bad” memes and straight-up eulogies. Sentiment’s screaming rock bottom, though. Prolonged slump, maybe even curtains for anything without a pulse. Could be off base here—data’s a fickle bitch—but the numbers are yelling “max pain.”

Scale-wise, we peaked at $25 billion in that 2021-22 mania, then ate a 97% faceplant through 2023. Late 2025? Total market’s scraping $30-40 billion, liquidity thinner than my patience for LinkedIn influencers.

Q4 2025’s a bloodbath: Sales nosedived from $629 million in October to $320 million in November—year’s low, vibes straight to hell. Global size bloated from $43 billion in 2024 to around $60 billion this year, but volumes tell the real story: contraction city. What drove it all? Blockchain’s verifiable scarcity—cool concept, until everyone’s minting crap. 24/7 global trading, but now it’s a ghost town.

## Main

Post-WWII boom: War bucks flooded abstract art; Peggy Guggenheim bet on the freaks and cleaned up. Our version? Crypto windfalls pumping NFTs as the new edge. ‘70s recession: Smart folks grabbed undervalued steals. Today? 2023-2025 bear market, November volumes at $320 million, Q4 sentiment in the dumpster—blue-chips slashed 50-80%, but the crowd’s chanting “dead.”

‘80s hype to ‘90s crash: Speculation balloon popped, quality endured.

NFT remix: $25 billion party to 97% wipeout; 2025’s dragging it out, no rebound in sight, worst quarter on record. NFTs sidelined while AI hogs the limelight.

## Conclusion

Museums like MoMA hoarding Punks and Squiggles. Stick to Punks, Beeple, Art Blocks. For the ultra-loaded, 2025-2030’s your window for iconic grabs before institutions swarm—but “down bad” mode screams caution.

Like ancient patrons, we’re molding the narrative as we ditch hype for substance. It’s exhausting. The renaissance? They say it’s brewing. Maybe hold off, sketch your own crap instead. Tell me if it spares your sanity.
