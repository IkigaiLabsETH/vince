You probably think the internet lives in the cloud. It doesn’t. 97–99 % of global data still travels through fiber-optic cables that lie on the seafloor, often in depths where sunlight has never reached. And right now, those cables are being cut faster than anyone wants to admit. In the last 24 months we have seen:

- 
Four cables simultaneously severed off West Africa (2024)

## Context

- 
Multiple deliberate cuts in the Red Sea by anchor-dragging ships linked to the Houthis

- 
Russian shadow-fleet vessels “accidentally” dragging anchors across Baltic telecom lines

- 
Repeated grey-zone sabotage around Taiwan’s Matsu Islands

## Main

**
Each incident costs hundreds of millions in lost connectivity and forces hyperscalers to reroute traffic at the speed of emergency Excel sheets. The repair process? There are exactly 22 aging cable-repair ships on the entire planet. Average wait time to even get one on station: 30–90 days. Full restoration can take six months. This is not a niche maritime problem. It is now a Tier-1 national-security and economic-risk issue. And the current toolkit is a 19th-century ship with a 1980s ROV hanging off the back.

Enter the new wave**

A handful of founders have realized that the same forces that transformed terrestrial robotics — cheap compute, machine learning, and high-bandwidth wireless — can finally be pointed at the ocean. The most interesting one we’ve found is still in stealth: Thalassa Robotics, founded this year in San Francisco by 26-year-old Arjun Prabhakar. Thalassa is betting everything on one insight:**If you can give a swarm of small AUVs real-time, high-bandwidth underwater wireless — even 50–100 Mbps over a few hundred meters — you break the acoustic-modem bottleneck that has paralyzed subsea robotics for fifty years.

Suddenly you get:

- 
Live video and sensor feeds to shore

- 
On-swarm AI inference for anomaly detection

- 
Human-in-the-loop override from a laptop in London while the robots patrol a cable landing in the South China Sea

In other words: Starlink, but for the seafloor.**

The competitive landscape is not asleep
**
Nauticus Robotics (ex-NASA team, public as KITT) already has 30+ patents and a transformer-style vehicle that switches from AUV to ROV mode. Vaart (UK), Eelume (Norway), and a dozen defense primes are all moving fast. But almost everyone is still playing in the old paradigm: single expensive vehicle, acoustic comms at 10–100 kbps, surface ship required. If Thalassa (or anyone) truly cracks dynamic underwater mesh networking at usable bandwidth, the legacy players are toast. The moat becomes software and swarm intelligence, not bigger pressure housings.

Investment math**

This is the rare sector where the macro tailwinds are so violent that even moderate technical success equals a massive outcome:

- 
Cable owners and insurers will pay almost anything for 72-hour response instead of 72-day response

- 
NATO and Indo-Pacific navies are writing checks today for exactly this capability

- 
Hyperscalers are self-insuring tens of billions in new cables and want resident guardians, not PowerPoint decks

We ran the comps. Recent subsea robotics rounds closed at $60–100 M post-money for companies with less tailwind and more mature (but less disruptive) tech. A working 5-node mesh demo in 2026 would justify a $300–500 M valuation overnight. Failure just means zero. Classic power-law territory.

**Bottom line**

## Conclusion

The internet’s physical backbone is now a battlefield, and the current defense is a handful of creaking ships and 1990s ROVs. The founder who delivers persistent, real-time, AI-native eyes on the seafloor will build one of the defining infrastructure companies of the decade.

We’re watching [Thalassa](https://www.thalassarobotics.com/) extremely closely.
