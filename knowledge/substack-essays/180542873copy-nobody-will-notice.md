## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **First Principles Thinking:** Reassessing investment theses from foundational concepts rather than prevailing narratives.
- **Long-Form Analysis:** Emphasizing detailed, in-depth exploration over superficial commentary to derive meaningful insights.
- **Quiet Research:** Prioritizing deep, solitary investigation over public performance to cultivate genuine understanding.
- **Curation of Audience:** Focusing on a dedicated, engaged audience rather than mass appeal to foster meaningful discourse.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Approach topics by stripping away assumptions and biases to identify core truths. Utilize first principles thinking to dissect complex concepts and reconstruct your understanding based on empirical evidence rather than trends or popularity. This method encourages skepticism of dominant narratives and fosters a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation. 

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for shifts in market sentiment that reflect deeper structural changes rather than temporary trends. Recognize when narratives are driven by performance art (i.e., flashy but shallow content) versus substantive analysis. Signals to watch include significant deviations from established norms, the emergence of new platforms for discussion (like Substack), and the behavior of niche audiences that prioritize depth over breadth.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Apply this thinking by dedicating time to revising your own beliefs and strategies in light of new information. Create a structure for long-form analysis that incorporates comprehensive research, real-time validations, and a willingness to admit uncertainty. Focus on building robust arguments that can withstand scrutiny while engaging with a small but committed audience for feedback. This strategy allows for the cultivation of deeper insights and enhances your adaptability in a rapidly changing landscape.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise to ensure clarity and usability in real-time application.

After 16 years in crypto, we’ve executed the quietest pivot of our lives. We used to live on Twitter. We were early. Signed up in 2007. Back in the before-CT-times, a single thread could clear decent views in a week, spark debates, land us in group chats with people who actually ship product. Then came 2020–21: we pushed back on the dominant Covid narrative at the exact moment the algorithm gods demanded compliance. The reach didn’t recover. 

Today our tweets die with single-digit impressions. It’s almost performance art at this point: how much signal can you fit into a message that literally nobody will see? So we stopped shouting into the void and started doing the only thing that ever actually mattered: re-underwriting every single one of our investment theses from scratch. Not in 280-character fragments. Not in 15-image carousels designed to game the timeline. But in long, ugly, deeply-researched pieces published on a platform that still lets you write more than a paragraph without being throttled: Substack.

## Context

Here’s the dirty secret nobody in this space wants to admit in 2025: the public timeline became a terrible place to think. It rewards speed, certainty, and performative confidence. It punishes doubt, nuance, and the slow process of changing your mind when the facts do. The median crypto “thesis” today is a vibe with a chart attached, posted by someone who is currently distributing into your bids. We got tired of playing that game. So this is what we’re doing instead:

- 
Every position we hold, every narrative we believe in, every “cycle meta” we think we understand: back to first principles.

- 
Ten-thousand-word autopsies on why we were wrong in 2022, what we missed in 2023, and why certain things that looked dead (Hyperstructures, proper DeFi, Bitcoin as collateral) are suddenly alive again.

## Main

- 
No rocket emojis. No “not financial advice” cop-outs. No teasing a big reveal behind a $500/month paywall. Just the raw notes: sources, data queries, invalidation levels, and the parts where we admit we still have no idea.

The audience will be tiny. That’s not a bug; it’s the entire point. We don’t need 300 k views anymore. We need 150 people who actually read the footnotes. The rest of the market can keep farming points and quoting each other in circles.
> 
There’s a reason the sharpest traders we know all have <5 k followers and post once a quarter: they’re too busy making money to perform insight. Twitter trained us to think in public. Substack is where we remember how to think in private, then publish the scars.

If you’re still here after a decade in this casino, you already know the score: the game is rigged against the loud, the lazy, and the late. The only sustainable edge left is the one you build when nobody’s watching: deeper research, clearer writing, colder execution. So yeah, we’re spending the next year (maybe the rest of the next bear market) quietly rewriting everything we think we know. One long essay at a time. On a platform that doesn’t throttle us for wrongthink. With an audience small enough that we can actually reply to every comment. You probably won’t see it on your timeline. That’s fine. The timeline stopped mattering somewhere around 2021. We’re not here to be influencer of the week.

We’re here to not be poor in 2030.

## Conclusion

See you on Substack.

Or don’t. Either way, the work continues.
