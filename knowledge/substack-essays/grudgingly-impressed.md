It’s December 18th, 2025, the city’s slushy and gray outside my window, and I’m nursing this lukewarm espresso because sleep’s a myth these days. Scrolling through the Coinbase keynote clips again—yeah, the one from today. You know that hollow laugh you do when the thing you’ve been sarcastically tracking for a decade suddenly gets a seat at the adult table? That’s me right now.
> 
I’m old enough to remember the 2024 election when Polymarket finally looked smarter than Nate Silver and everyone lost their minds. I figured: cool, another four-year cycle. Pump, dump, repeat. Except... 2025 didn’t play that game. Volumes crashed right after the election, sure. Down 60-something percent. Classic. But then they climbed back and kept climbing. We’re talking $40-50 billion total across the big platforms for the year. Polymarket north of $21 billion. Kalshi scraping $18 billion. Some wild late entrant like Opinion printing billions in weeks during Q4. Peak months pushing $10-14 billion. Weeks topping $2 billion. And the kicker? Most of it wasn’t politics.

Sports just devoured the category. Kalshi at 85-90% sports volume, Polymarket lower around 39%, but overall? Sports took 60-80% easy. Kalshi’s Robinhood integration back in August was massive—your average fantasy bro suddenly trading NFL outcomes with actual good odds. Peer-to-peer, no house edge bleeding you slow. Whales piled in. Single weeks on Kalshi alone clearing a billion in sports handle.

## Context

Then today Coinbase drops the hammer: full Kalshi integration live in the app. Thousands of contracts right there next to your Bitcoin balance. Millions of users who never touched a prediction market now one tap away. Kalshi’s CEO probably popped champagne at noon. Coinbase framing it as “the everything exchange.” It’s distribution rocket fuel.

The non-sports stuff grew even faster percentage-wise, which is honestly the part I didn’t see coming. Economics up 900% year-over-year. Tech and science? Over 1,600%. Culture and entertainment exploding—some stretches 625% month-over-month. And there’s zero competition there. Wanna bet on the top Netflix show next week? Some celebrity meltdown odds? This is literally the only game in town.

Still miles behind traditional sportsbooks, though. Those guys did $150 billion in 2024 alone—FanDuel and DraftKings splitting damn near $100 billion between them. Prediction markets grabbed maybe 20-30% equivalent slice when you adjust for the double-counting, mostly by being legal in banned states and pricing sharper. 

But no real parlays yet. Props are anemic. That’s a huge hole—parlays are 30% of sportsbook volume for a reason. Retail loves the lottery ticket vibe. 

## Main

Money’s pouring in anyway. Polymarket took $2 billion from the NYSE’s parent at like $9 billion val. Kalshi just raised another billion, pushing them to $11 billion. Partnerships everywhere—NHL, UFC, Yahoo Finance, CNN. Polymarket relaunched their U.S. app this month (waitlist, sports-first). Token and airdrop rumors for 2026. Opinion blew up on BNB Chain with that AI market-creation gimmick—points, incentives, the usual crypto jazz.

DraftKings and FanDuel are coming, obviously. Railbird acquisition, CME partnerships, launches next year. They’ll steal the easy stuff—rates, elections, big sports. But the weird long-tail? Culture bets, niche crypto outcomes? 

## Conclusion

That stays here.

Look, I’m not drinking the Kool-Aid full strength. Regulators could still kneecap it. States are already lawyering up over whether these are “gambling.” Another hype wave could inflate and burst. But people trading on quiet Tuesdays because the edge is real. Normies getting onboard because Coinbase just made it brain-dead simple.

Next time you’re in Coinbase topping up or whatever, just glance at the new Kalshi tab. Throw twenty bucks on something you actually have an opinion on—some NBA game, a culture market, whatever. Feel out if the odds treat you better than your sportsbook does. Worst case you lose lunch money and confirm I’m still the jaded asshole you’ve always known. Best case you make a few bucks and shoot me a DM. I’ll be here, same time tomorrow, same cold coffee.
