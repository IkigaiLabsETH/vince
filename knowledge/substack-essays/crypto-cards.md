I’ve got that familiar hollow laugh in my chest, the same one I had in 2012 when people swore Google+ was going to kill Facebook, or in 2017 when every ICO deck promised “Uber for toothbrushes, but on the blockchain.”

Here we are again. Same song, different costume.

## Context

The truth about crypto cards? They’re the Substack of payments.

Hear me out.

Back in 2021 every burned-out journalist with 8k Twitter followers launched a newsletter, slapped ConvertKit on it, and called themselves a media entrepreneur. Ninety-five percent of those are now making $11 a month and quietly went back to day jobs. The survivors? Either the infrastructure (Ghost, Substack itself—or the handful of freaks who actually built an audience before the platform existed.

## Main

Same exact movie playing out with crypto cards right now.

All these shiny metal cards with laser-etched seed phrases? Content farms.
Raise $15 million, license Rain or Striga for pennies, hire three ex-Revolut bros, give the card a name that sounds like a Bond villain (Arc, Plasma, Tempo, whatever), promise 8% cashback in some token that immediately dumps 90%.
I swear I saw the same pitch deck template in 2021, only the word “newsletter” was replaced with “card.”

And yeah, the purists are technically right: every swipe is just free advertising for Visa. You’re still KYC’d to death. You’re still spending fiat. Your privacy is a myth. The bank can freeze you tomorrow because you bought the wrong protein powder. All true.

But here’s what the purists always miss, because they’ve never actually had to pay rent with crypto in a country that isn’t the Netherlands: normal people do not give a single shit about ideology when the UX is smooth and they get 3% back.

Remember when everyone said no one would ever pay for news again? Then Spotify wrapped came out and people happily pay $18 a month to feel like they’re winning at music. Humans are pathetic. We love shiny status objects. A heavy metal card that makes the bartender do a double-take is crack.

I took one of those cards to Argentina last year—some no-name project that raised $22 million and died six months later. Worked perfectly. Got me into the Amex lounge in Ezeiza because the centurion chick saw the black card and assumed I was somebody. Felt like a drug. I knew it was a scam. Didn’t care. That’s the dirty little secret: the scam works until it doesn’t, and by then you’ve onboarded another million normies who now hold USDC and think they’re in crypto.

Ether.fi is the only one the purists kinda like? Cute. That thesis lasted about thirty hot minutes. Ledger Card, MetaMask Card, Phantom’s coming Solana card—these aren’t startups, they’re distribution machines with nine-figure user bases. They’re going to win the same way Substack won: not because they’re pure, but because the card is just one tiny tab in an app you already open thirty times a day.

The branded ones will all die. Obviously. Same as 98% of Substacks. The infrastructure (Rain, Striga, Circle’s card program, Coinbase quietly white-labeling for half the market) will keep printing money. Because someone has to issue the plastic, baby, and it sure as hell isn’t going to be a DAO.

Direct stablecoin acceptance at Walmart by 2030? Sure, and I’ll be front-row at the Radiohead reunion. It’ll happen in pockets—travel, freelancers, porn, onlyfans, maybe El Salvador if Nayib doesn’t get bored—but for daily spend in the rich world? Nah. People will keep swiping the stupid card because it just works and they get points. Inertia beats ideology every single time.

So yeah, crypto cards are training wheels. They’re also the most effective onboarding funnel crypto has ever had. And the second direct payments actually feel as seamless as Apple Pay, the cards will quietly disappear into the wallet app like everything else.

## Conclusion

Until then I’m keeping my dumb metal card. Makes me feel rich when I buy overpriced oat milk. Sue me.

Next time you’re about to write another 4,000-word sermon about how this week’s toy violates the whitepaper, close the laptop, go touch grass, and then ask yourself: does my mom know how to pay with USDC at Target yet? No? Then maybe chill. The revolution is still in beta.
