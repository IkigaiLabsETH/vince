## The Grand Cycle

### Everything is Cyclical

> "The pendulum doesn't stop in the middle—it goes to extremes." — Howard Marks

Markets move in cycles because human nature doesn't change:
- **Greed → Euphoria → Complacency → Anxiety → Panic → Despair → Hope → Recovery → Greed**

### The 4 Phases of a Market Cycle

| Phase | Characteristic | Emotion | Action |
|-------|---------------|---------|--------|
| **1. Hope** | Markets bottom | Despair → Hope | Accumulate |
| **2. Optimism** | Uptrend begins | Hope → Optimism | Add to positions |
| **3. Euphoria** | Mania begins | Optimism → Excitement | Take profits |
| **4. Despair** | Crash | Excitement → Fear | Hold cash, wait |

## Debt Cycles (Ray Dalio)

### The Economic Machine

1. **Productivity Growth** (long-term driver)
2. **Short-Term Debt Cycle** (5-8 years)
   - Fed lowers rates → borrowing → spending → asset prices rise
   - Fed raises rates → debt service rises → spending falls → recession
3. **Long-Term Debt Cycle** (75-100 years)
   - Debt grows faster than income
   - Eventually requires deleveraging

### The 3 Knowns
1. **Long-term trends** (productivity)
2. **Near-term cycles** (credit)
3. **Specific events** (black swans)
