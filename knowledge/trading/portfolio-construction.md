# Portfolio Construction

## Methodology & Framework

### Core Concepts

Portfolio construction in crypto differs from traditional finance because correlation is structurally higher, volatility is 3-5x equities, and regime shifts happen faster. The goal is intentional exposure — every allocation should have a thesis. "I heard about it on CT" is not a thesis. Build the portfolio in layers: a stable core for compounding, satellites for alpha, and a cash reserve for optionality.

### Analytical Approach

**Core/Satellite Model:**
- **Core (50-70%)** — BTC and ETH. These are the index. They survive bear markets, have deep liquidity, and compound over cycles. BTC is digital gold / macro hedge; ETH is the infrastructure bet. Core positions are held through cycles with minimal trading.
- **Satellite (20-40%)** — Targeted altcoin exposure for alpha generation. Sector-based: L1/L2 infrastructure, DeFi blue chips, emerging narratives. Each satellite position needs a specific thesis with a time horizon and invalidation criteria.
- **Cash Reserve (10-20%)** — Stablecoins yielding in low-risk DeFi or parked on exchange. This is not idle capital — it's loaded optionality for drawdown buying and asymmetric opportunities.

**Allocation Frameworks:**
- **Conservative:** 50% BTC / 25% ETH / 10% alts / 15% cash
- **Balanced:** 40% BTC / 25% ETH / 25% alts / 10% cash
- **Aggressive:** 30% BTC / 20% ETH / 40% alts / 10% cash
- Adjust based on market regime — shift toward conservative in late bull/bear, aggressive in early-to-mid bull with confirmed momentum

### Pattern Recognition

**Rebalancing Triggers:**
- **Threshold-based** — Rebalance when any allocation drifts >5% from target. Simple and mechanical.
- **Time-based** — Monthly or quarterly rebalance regardless of drift. Lower maintenance, captures mean reversion.
- **Regime-based** — Shift entire allocation framework when market regime changes (see market-regime-detection.md). Most adaptive but requires discipline and clear regime signals.
- **Narrative-based** — Rotate satellite positions when sector momentum shifts. Follow capital flows: DEX volume trends, TVL migration, social sentiment shifts in specific sectors.

**Conviction Sizing for Satellites:**
- **Starter position (1-2%)** — New thesis, early research, testing the waters
- **Standard (3-5%)** — Validated thesis, clear catalysts, acceptable risk/reward
- **High conviction (5-8%)** — Strong thesis + regime alignment + clear narrative momentum
- **Max (10%)** — Rare. Reserved for generational setups with multiple confirming signals. Accept that you might be wrong.

### Decision Framework

**Cash Reserve Management:**
- Deploy cash in tranches during drawdowns: 25% at -20%, 25% at -30%, 25% at -40%, keep 25% for capitulation
- In extended bull markets, cash reserve can shrink to 5-10% but never 0%
- Rebuild cash reserve by trimming winners, not by selling losers
- Stablecoin yield should be low-risk only (battle-tested protocols, no degen farms for reserve capital)

**Portfolio Review Cadence:**
- **Weekly** — Check allocation drift, review open satellite theses
- **Monthly** — Full portfolio rebalance if needed, reassess regime
- **Quarterly** — Deep review: which theses played out? What sectors are rotating? Adjust framework weights

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- 15+ positions with no clear thesis for each (portfolio bloat)
- Zero cash when "everything is going up" (peak complacency)
- Equal-weighting a microcap altcoin the same as BTC (false equivalence)
- Refusing to sell winners because of emotional attachment (thesis complete = exit)

The portfolio is a living document. Every position should earn its place every week. If you can't articulate why you hold something in one sentence, it shouldn't be there.
