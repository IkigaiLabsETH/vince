# AI-Crypto Bear Cases & Risks

*Last updated: 2026-02-15*

## Methodology & Framework

Steel-man the bear case. Most AI tokens will go to zero — this is the base rate for any crypto subsector, and AI is no exception. The framework: (1) What percentage of projects have real technology vs. narrative wrappers? (2) Can decentralized approaches actually compete with centralized AI? (3) What regulatory risks exist? (4) What survives a full bear market? Intellectual honesty about risks is the only edge in a sector dominated by hype.

## Most AI Tokens Are Vaporware

The uncomfortable truth: the majority of AI-crypto projects are token wrappers around API calls to OpenAI or open-source models, with no proprietary technology and no defensible moat.

**The vaporware spectrum:**

- **Pure narrative** — whitepaper mentions "AI" and "blockchain," token trades on hype alone, no working product. These die first.
- **API wrappers** — functioning product that calls centralized AI APIs, adds a token payment layer. No technical differentiation. Could be replicated in a weekend. The token adds friction, not value.
- **Legitimate but uncompetitive** — real technology, genuine team, but the decentralized approach is 5-10x more expensive or slower than centralized alternatives with no compelling advantage for most users.
- **Real and differentiated** — genuine technical moat, use cases where decentralization provides measurable advantages. Maybe 5-10% of projects by count, though they'll capture most of the long-term value.

During bull markets, the market doesn't distinguish between these categories. During bear markets, it does — violently.

## Centralization of Actual AI

The elephant in the room: AI is centralizing, not decentralizing.

**Training** requires billions in compute. Only a handful of organizations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta) can afford frontier model training. This concentration is *increasing* — each generation costs more, and data moats widen. No crypto project is training competitive frontier models. Period.

**Inference** is more feasible to decentralize, but centralized providers have massive advantages: optimized hardware (custom ASICs), economies of scale, established SLAs, and lower latency. Decentralized networks compete on cost only when subsidized by token emissions.

**Data** advantages compound. The best models need the best data. Centralized companies with billions of users generate proprietary datasets that open-source and decentralized approaches can't match.

The honest bull case for decentralized AI isn't "we'll replace OpenAI" — it's "we'll serve the niches that centralized AI won't or can't." Censorship-resistant inference, permissionless model marketplaces, on-chain composability. These are real but narrow.

## Regulatory Uncertainty

AI regulation is coming fast, and it threatens crypto-AI from multiple angles:

- **Model liability** — if decentralized networks serve harmful AI outputs, who's liable? Token holders? Node operators? Nobody? Regulators won't accept "nobody."
- **KYC/AML for AI services** — as AI-generated fraud and deepfakes proliferate, regulators may require identity verification for AI service providers. Permissionless networks can't easily comply.
- **Compute restrictions** — export controls on AI chips already exist (US-China). Extension to decentralized compute networks is plausible — regulators may view permissionless GPU networks as sanctions evasion tools.
- **Securities classification** — AI tokens with revenue-sharing or staking yields face the same securities scrutiny as DeFi tokens, with the added political attention that "AI" brings.

The regulatory surface area is enormous because AI-crypto sits at the intersection of two sectors that regulators are independently targeting. Projects that ignore this risk are building on sand.

## What Survives

In a full bear market where narratives die and only fundamentals remain, the survivors share common traits:

**Infrastructure over applications.** Picks-and-shovels projects (compute networks, verification layers) survive because they serve multiple use cases. Application-layer projects die when their specific narrative fades.

**Real revenue, real users.** Projects generating stablecoin-denominated revenue from organic users (not token-subsidized) have a floor. Everything else is pure speculation with no support level.

**Technical moats.** Novel cryptographic approaches (ZK proofs of inference), unique network effects (Bittensor's intelligence market), or proprietary datasets. Not "partnerships" or "integrations."

**Lean teams, long runways.** Projects that raised in stables and spend conservatively. Those that treasury-managed their own token and now face a 90% drawdown are dead walking.

**Regulatory readiness.** Projects with legal structures, compliance frameworks, and the ability to adapt to regulation without fundamentally breaking their model.

The brutal prediction: 90%+ of current AI tokens won't exist in meaningful form by 2028. The 5-10% that survive will capture enormous value precisely because the space will be cleared of noise. The game is identifying that 5-10% early and sizing positions to survive the drawdown that kills the rest.
