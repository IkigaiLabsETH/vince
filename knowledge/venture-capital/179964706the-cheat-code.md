## Knowledge Card

- **Type**: Framework
- **PrimaryEntityOrTopic**: “The cheat code” — stop fighting platforms; own them (and prioritize freedom over spreadsheets)
- **AliasesAndKeywords**: “if you can’t beat them, buy them”, platform economics, paid acquisition saturation, organic vs paid, owning competitors/suppliers, crisis investing, portfolio concentration, Bitcoin conviction, forced sales regret, “buy when nobody wants it”
- **TimeContext**: As written (stories span 1999–2025; all prices/returns are historical examples)
- **Summary**: A two-part framework: (1) when platforms and VC-subsidized competitors make operating economics impossible, shift from competing to owning the platforms; (2) the same “run toward the fire sale” instinct applies to buying unloved assets (e.g., crisis equities, then later Bitcoin) while optimizing for time freedom.
- **KeyPoints**:
  - Paid acquisition can flip from “cheat code” to negative-sum when subsidized incumbents bid without profit constraints (as written).
  - When you cannot outspend platforms/VC-backed giants, a strategic pivot is to own the winners rather than compete with them (as written).
  - The essay frames a concentrated “buy competitors and suppliers” portfolio constructed during crisis conditions as the original “cheat code” (as written; historical).
  - A follow-on lesson is that lifestyle/freedom-driven decisions (even if “wrong” on spreadsheet) can still align with long-run compounding if paired with contrarian buying during drawdowns (as written).
  - The Bitcoin section frames conviction as forged in regret and bear markets, not in euphoria (as written; historical).
- **UseWhen**:
  - Explaining the operator-to-owner transition as a response to platform dynamics.
  - Thinking about marketing channel risk (paid vs organic) and “platform tax.”
  - Using “buy the sale” heuristics for crisis investing and long-horizon conviction building.
- **DoNotUseFor**:
  - Treating quoted prices (equities, BTC) or returns as current market data.
  - Any claim that a past playbook will map 1:1 onto current conditions.
  - Real-time portfolio allocation decisions without current data and constraints.
- **EvidenceNote**: Extracted from the Appendix; no new claims added.

## Appendix (original essay, verbatim)

---

It was 1999 and I was twenty-something, wind-burnt, and living out of a van parked on a beach that most people couldn’t pronounce. A guy in linen trousers walked up, handed me a Naish kite fresh off the boat from Maui, and said, “We’re raising a small private round for a luxury travel company. Office is right there on the sand. Want in?”

I wrote the check the same afternoon. The office on the beach, free gear, kitesurfing every lunch break — it felt like the universe was paying me to live the dream.

Six months later I bailed. Another offer came: assistant to the CEO of the biggest surf brand in the region. I took it. The next four years were an MBA that no university could ever sell you — supply-chain wars in Indonesia, container ships stuck in Suez before anyone cared about Suez, factory owners who spoke better English than I did, and the brutal reality of what it actually costs to put a logo on a T-shirt and convince a fifteen-year-old in Kansas that it’s cool.

When I finally went out on my own I thought I knew everything. I opened the first kitesurf school in the country, snagged distribution for two of the hypest brands on the planet, and learned — fast — what happens when you no longer have a hundred-person team and a billion dollars in revenue to throw at problems. Guerrilla marketing is romantic until the guerrillas are just you, a laptop, and a credit card that’s starting to smoke.

Then Google AdWords launched.

Holy hell.

I was buying keywords like “kitesurfing [my spot]” for pennies. Bookings poured in. ROI was obscene. For three golden years I felt invincible, out-ranking even the early versions of Booking.com in my little niche. Then the VC money showed up. Booking, Expedia, later Airbnb — they didn’t care about profit. They bid whatever it took. My beautiful 20× ROI turned into 1.2× and then into losing money just to stay visible. I was a guy with a credit card fighting corporations with printing presses.

We pivoted. Relocated the whole operation to the best point break on earth, re-launched as a surf-travel + real-estate hybrid (livethelifetv). Same story, bigger scale. Bidding wars got worse. I was running 100+ AdWords campaigns by myself. One day Google’s account team called.“ Dude, you spent seven figures with us over the years and then just… stopped. Everything okay?” I laughed. Told them the economics no longer worked. They asked to review my account. Spent two hours on the phone, then said: “ Honestly, you should consult. Big agencies would pay you $300 an hour for this level of sophistication.”“ Never,” I said. “My time is the only thing I’ll never sell.” They respected it. I closed the account that week. Shifted everything to organic social. Facebook, Instagram (back when it was still fun), YouTube. After burning ~$100 million worth of eyeballs on Google, we started reaching 300k people a week with content marketing. Conversion rates went through the roof. Photos and videos shot on RED cameras, edits at 3 a.m. with Red Bull coursing through my veins, captions written like love letters to the ocean.

I got cocky again. Flew to Palo Alto, walked straight into Facebook HQ, asked reception if Marc wanted free surfing lessons in exchange for a meeting. Security escorted me out in under four minutes. Undeterred, we flew to New York, filmed Kelly Slater surfing a perfect wave and Tony Hawk doing McTwists over the Hudson. Posted it. Millions of views.

Then, overnight, Zuckerberg flipped the switch. Organic reach went from 15–20% to 1–2% literally the next week. Our 100k hardcore fans still showed up, but growth flat-lined. Ten years of grinding, and the algorithms had spoken.

We were burnt. Not just tired — hollowed out. So we did the only sensible thing: surfed more, worked less. Dawn patrols with dolphins, sunset sessions under rainbows, trading deadlines for lineups. The wave we lived on got called “the most perfect wave in the world” by people who have surfed everywhere. Tom Curren paddled out one morning, looked around, and just said, “Yep.” That was enough validation for a lifetime.

It felt like endless summer. 

And endless summers have a way of giving you clarity.

One morning in 2009, nursing a coffee and watching the Dow drop another 500 points, I had the epiphany.

We’d spent a decade trying to beat:

- 
Booking.com

- 
Expedia

- 
Priceline

- 
Later Airbnb (whose VCs we had literally pitched the “rent your house to strangers” idea to in 2007 and been laughed out of the room)

- 
Facebook

- 
Google

- 
Even the surf brands that had gone public and forgotten their soul

And we’d spent a decade using:

- 
Apple computers

- 
GoPro cameras

- 
Nike wetsuits (after Billabong and Quiksilver imploded)

- 
Visa cards

- 
Akamai CDNs

- 
Boeing planes to get there

- 
Marriott hotels when the surf was flat

Every company that had made LiveTheLifeTV possible was publicly traded. Every company we’d bled trying to compete with was publicly traded.

If you can’t beat them… buy them.

We took whatever private capital we had left — profits from the kitesurf school, real-estate flips, a few lucky domain sales — and went shopping during the depth of the financial crisis.

NVIDIA at $9 (pre-split).**Google at $172.
Amazon at $64.
Booking at $11.
Facebook at $19 (IPO dip).
Apple at $11.
Priceline at $27.
Expedia post-spin-off.
Tesla at $5 (yes, really).
Even a little Zoom, Twilio, and VFC (Vans) when they looked cheap.

We didn’t diversify into index funds. We bought our competitors and our suppliers. The companies that had indirectly caused us the most pain — and the ones that had given us the tools to fight.

It felt like finding the ultimate cheat code.

Today that portfolio is worth… a lot. Enough that I haven’t logged into a Google Ads account in fifteen years. Enough that the same VCs who laughed at us in 2007 now send me cap tables “in case you ever want to invest.”

I never did.

Because the real cheat code wasn’t the stocks.

It was realizing that the game was never about beating the giants.

It was about recognizing when to stop fighting them — and start owning them.

These days I still wake at 6 a.m. to surf. 

The dolphins still show up. 

The wave is still perfect.

Only difference is, when I check my phone after the session, the companies that once kept me up at night are now quietly sending me dividends.

Endless summer, indeed.If you can’t beat them, join them.

Or better yet — buy them when they’re on sale and go surf.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Disruption & Adaptation:** Recognizing the need to pivot in response to market changes and competitive pressures.
- **Organic Growth vs. Paid Acquisition:** Understanding the balance and transition between paid advertising and organic content marketing strategies.
- **Value of Experience:** Leveraging firsthand experiences to inform business decisions and strategy development.
- **Community Engagement:** Building a dedicated customer base through authentic storytelling and engagement rather than purely transactional relationships.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Approach venture capital as a dynamic landscape where adaptability is crucial. Assess market signals that indicate when to pivot your business model and marketing strategies. Evaluate both qualitative experiences and quantitative metrics to inform decisions, keeping in mind that both can offer valuable insights.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Watch for shifts in consumer engagement and platform algorithms that can drastically affect visibility and growth. Identify competitors’ strategies and market responses to gauge when disruption is likely. Recognize signs of saturation in paid advertising markets, prompting a need for alternative growth strategies.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Develop a two-pronged strategy: maintain a robust organic marketing presence while monitoring the viability of paid channels. Utilize storytelling and community-building as core components of marketing efforts. Regularly reassess your business model against market realities and remain agile in your approach to product offerings and marketing tactics.

**Important Notes:**
- Emphasize adaptability over rigidity; the ability to pivot is often more valuable than historical knowledge. Focus on building relationships and community rather than just chasing numbers. Implement regular checkpoints to evaluate both internal operations and external market conditions, ensuring alignment with emerging trends and consumer preferences. Prioritize learning from experiences to inform future decisions rather than relying solely on traditional metrics.

How I sold the perfect portfolio at the bottom, bought a crumbling house, and accidentally stumbled into the next cheat code anyway. **

I’m writing this from the same salty MacBook, but the view is different now.

Instead of an endless pointbreak, I’m looking at a half-renovated seventies house on a quiet street in Europe. No dolphins this morning. Just the neighbor’s rooster and the distant sound of church bells. Debt-free, sun on my face, … 

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. This is the part of the story where the hero does something catastrophically stupid.

2013–2014. The portfolio we built during the GFC had 30–40x’d in places. NVIDIA alone was up almost 50x from our crisis prices. Amazon, Google, Booking, Tesla — everything was screaming. Friends who had index funds were happy with 3x. We were sitting on life-changing, never-have-to-work-again money.

And then we decided to “live the life.”

We sold almost everything.

Not because we needed the cash. 

We just wanted to move continents, slow down, buy a house with cash, be closer to our family, surf emptier waves, breathe.

Financially? Suicide.

Emotionally? The best decision we ever made.

We found an old house that stole our hearts on day one. A love affair with a money pit that still isn’t finished. We paid cash, zero debt, and felt like kings.

Then came the orange pill.

Bitcoin had just dropped from $1,160 to under $200. Everyone I respected in tech was calling it dead for the 87th time. I looked at my empty brokerage account, looked at the renovator’s nightmare we now owned, and thought:“ Fuck mobile apps. Fuck social media. Fuck renting eyeballs. Money itself is the next protocol to get disrupted.” So I went full degen.

**2016–2017: I’m back grinding 18-hour days, but this time it’s all crypto. **

Onchain social media, onchain photography, tokenized real estate, decentralized streaming — literally every idea we ever had in Web2, but now on Ethereum.

We even got a FINRA-licensed partner to launch the first travel token allowed on the Apple Store. (The company rug-pulled six months later. Classic.)

Meanwhile Bitcoin crashes again — $20k to $3,200 in 2018.

Most people quit.

I saw the fire sale of the century.

We sold the last non-essential assets we still had:

- 
The empty beachfront plot we kept “just in case.”

- 
The vintage Porsche I’d driven to every perfect wave for fifteen years.

- 
The Rolex Submariner I wore while getting barreled with dolphins.

- 
Even the collector surfboard I swore I’d never part with.

Everything went into cold storage.

I told my wife: “ We’re either going to be very rich or very, very stupid. But at least we won’t be in the middle anymore.” We chose not to be in the middle.

**Fast-forward to today, November 2025.**

The house is still not fully renovated (okay, 90 %, the kitchen island still needs marble). We’re still debt-free. And that Bitcoin stack we bought between $3,200 and $8,000 during the nuclear winter? It’s now worth dramatically more than the entire stock portfolio we sold in 2014.

Karma? Cosmic joke? The universe’s way of saying “you only win when you stop trying to win”? Maybe all three.

Here’s the punchline nobody saw coming: The same instinct that made me buy my competitors when they were cheap in 2009 is the exact same instinct that made me sell everything and go all-in on Bitcoin when everyone was running away in 2018. Both times I was running toward freedom, not money. Both times I bet on the thing that made everything else possible:

2009 → the internet platforms that powered modern travel
2018 → the internet money that powers actual freedom

Both times I was wrong in the short term and accidentally right in the long term. Both times I chose lifestyle over spreadsheet. And both times the universe rewarded the lifestyle choice with absurd financial upside I never asked for.

So this is the real cheat code — the one that actually lasts:

Stop trying to beat the game.
Stop trying to time the game.
Just keep making decisions that let you wake up stoked every single day.

Buy the waves.
Buy the house that makes your heart skip.
Buy the asset nobody wants when it’s bleeding.

The money is just the byproduct.

These days I split my time between restoring the house and checking mempools. And when old surf buddies message me asking how the hell I “timed Bitcoin so perfectly,” I just laugh. I didn’t time anything. I just refused to sell my time, refused to take on debt, and kept betting on whatever made the future feel inevitable — even when it looked insane.

The endless summer never actually ended.

It just moved continents and changed currencies.

See you out there — wherever “there” is for you.

Still riding sets, still stacking sats, still zero debt.

Like a summer that never seems to end.
