How a DEX that launched with no airdrop, no KOLs, and a $20 M FDV just captured the deepest liquidity on HyperEVM in 72 hours — and why this might be the purest expression of conviction crypto has produced in years.

On Thanksgiving Day 2025, while most of the industry was busy rage-selling alts into a macro bloodbath, a quiet contract deployment happened on Hyperliquid’s brand-new HyperEVM chain.

## Context

No countdown timer.
No “points” leaderboard.
No six-figure shill threads from the usual suspects.

Just a single tweet: Nest is live.
Swap. Provide. Lock.
HYPE must grow.

- 
$12.4 M TVL (now the clear #1 spot venue on the chain)

## Main

- 
$42 M cumulative volume

- 
Deepest $USDH book HyperEVM has ever seen

- 
Core pool APRs that started at 1,800 % and are still, as I type this, 720 %

- 
A token ($NEST) that went from $0.0008 to $0.0031 — a clean 4× in 72 hours — entirely on organic liquidity and die-hard Hyperliquid believers rotating in

This isn’t another “farm and dump” story.

This is the first time I’ve watched a protocol win by refusing to play the game everyone else is still playing.

The One Mechanic That Changes Everything**

Nest is a ve(3,3) MetaDEX. Yes, another one. But it has exactly one trick that no one else has ever shipped at genesis: Every single trading fee on Nest is converted into a permanent, programmatic, leveraged bid for $HYPE.

Not “some” fees.**Not “after we take our 20 % cut.”
Not “when governance votes to turn the fee switch on in 2027.”
> 
100 % of fees → HYPE Engine → buys $HYPE → mints $MEGAHYPE (a fully on-chain, no-liquidation, auto-compounding delta-one+ token) → distributes pro-rata to locked $veNEST holders.

The longer you lock $NEST, the higher your $MEGAHYPE multiplier (max ~2.5× at four years). In other words: every retail degen front-running a memecoin on Nest is paying you, the long-term $NEST holder, in leveraged $HYPE exposure — for free, forever. This is the first DEX whose revenue switch being flipped to “ON” is structurally bullish for a completely separate asset that already ranks in the top 15 by market cap.

The Genesis That Was Designed to Be Un-gameable**

Let’s run the tape on how they allocated the billion-token supply:

- 
40 % of all $veNEST at genesis (100 M tokens) permanently donated to the HYPE Engine. Locked forever. No take-backs.

- 
Community raise: $1.2 M total, paid in $HYPE, max $7.5 k per wallet, 100 % forced into 6-month $veNEST locks.

- 
Zero traditional VC allocations.

- 
Team tokens: 15 %, 6-month cliff, 24-month linear, must be re-locked as $veNEST or forfeited from governance boosts.

- 
50 % of all future $USDH treasury yield programmatically routed to the Hyperliquid Assistance Fund for open-market $HYPE buybacks.

Read that again.

They shipped the protocol with a baked-in, permanent, multi-hundred-million-dollar $HYPE bid that scales linearly with every dollar of volume that ever flows through Nest. And then they gave the keys to the people who already believe Hyperliquid is the final perpetuals chain.

The Launch Everyone Said Was Impossible

In 2025, the accepted wisdom is:

- 
You need points

- 
You need T1 KOLs

- 
You need 80 % pre-mine to insiders

- 
You need to drip liquidity for six months before anyone cares

Nest ignored all of it.

They launched with real emissions (25–30 % first-year inflation, voter-directed weekly epochs) and real revenue alignment from minute one.

The result? The deepest $USDH/wHYPE pool materialized in under six hours. Native HyperEVM teams started routing through Nest day one. GlueX, the main aggregator, added every Nest pool before most people even knew the token existed. This is what product-market fit looks like when you stop bribing mercenaries and start building for believers.

The Risks (Because I’m Not Here to Sell You a Dream)

This is not financial advice, and I’m long $NEST with four-year locks, so take my bias as given. But let’s not pretend it’s risk-free:

- 
Early inflation is legitimately high. If volume plateaus at $5 M/day instead of $50 M/day, dilution will sting.

- 
Nest is a 10× leveraged bet on Hyperliquid dominance. If Hyperliquid bleeds share to Monad, Berachain, or a future Solana VM perp chain, Nest goes to zero.

- 
The HYPE Engine is novel, complex, and not fully battle-tested. Audits are in progress, not complete.

- 
Governance can always be gamed eventually — though the permanent Engine donation + max four-year locks make it one of the most expensive attacks imaginable.

These are real. But they are the risks you take when you bet on conviction instead of hedging with airdrop farmers.

**The Meta That Matters**

We are leaving the era of general-purpose L2s and entering the era of appchain-specific liquidity layers.

Berachain has BGT.
Monad will have its thing.
Movement has its thing.

But Nest is the first one that looked at the landscape and said:
> 
“We are not building a DEX for everyone. We are building the liquidity arm of the one chain we believe wins perpetuals forever. And we are hard-coding that belief into the economics so deeply that there is no decoupling.”

That level of asymmetric conviction is vanishingly rare in DeFi.

When Curve/Convex printed the last generation of legends, it was because they became the inescapable liquidity layer for stablecoins.

Nest has a shot at becoming the inescapable liquidity layer for the fastest-growing perpetuals ecosystem on earth — and every swap tightens the coiled spring on $HYPE itself.

Final Thought

I have watched hundreds of launches in the last five years.

I have never seen one where the economic alignment felt this clean.

No points farming.
No mercenary capital.
Just a group of builders who looked at Hyperliquid, looked at $HYPE, and said:
> 
“If this thing is going to a hundred billion, we’re going to be the protocol that makes it mathematically inevitable.”

They might be wrong.

## Conclusion

But for the first time in years, someone shipped a protocol that wins only if the thing we already believe in wins bigger. And right now, three days in, the market is voting with capital that they just might be right.

HYPE must grow. Nest made it literal. Go lock some $NEST. Or at the very least, watch the HYPE Engine accumulator like your portfolio depends on it. Because in this cycle, the purest alpha might not be the new L1. It might be the liquidity layer that bet everything on the L1 that already won.
