## Knowledge Card

- **Type**: CompanyThesis
- **PrimaryEntityOrTopic**: Hyperliquid (HYPE) — onchain/perps exchange framed as a “valuation dislocation”
- **AliasesAndKeywords**: Hyperliquid, HYPE, perps, DEX perps, buyback and burn, token unlocks, HyperEVM, HIP-3, open interest (OI), fees, Robinhood analogy, Coinbase listing/ETF framing
- **TimeContext**: As written (mentions 2025 figures; October–November 2025; unlock schedule “through 2026”)
- **Summary**: A valuation memo arguing Hyperliquid is the “weird now, obvious later” trade: extreme revenue per employee and aggressive buybacks/burns at a low multiple (as framed), with the key bear case being unlock-driven sell pressure and competitive erosion.
- **KeyPoints**:
  - The memo claims unusually high revenue/profit per employee and compares Hyperliquid’s implied multiple to public brokers/exchanges (as written; time-sensitive).
  - It frames Hyperliquid as “the exchange itself” (not a broker) built on its own chain, with fast settlement and 24/7 trading across markets (as written).
  - Adoption is argued to be constrained primarily by fiat onboarding friction and “token stigma,” with the thesis that mainstream access removes both (as written).
  - A central mechanic is described as “97% of profit” used for buyback/burn, intended to overwhelm unlocks if volume persists (as written; time-sensitive).
  - Bear case section lists concrete concerns: lower OI, fee compression, competitive venues, opaque allocations, unlock sizes, HyperEVM launch quality (as written).
  - Bull rebuttal section argues selling pressure is overstated and that buybacks + market share + volume can dominate over time (as written; time-sensitive).
- **UseWhen**:
  - Summarizing the Hyperliquid thesis, bear case, and what would invalidate it.
  - Explaining “valuation dislocation” frameworks applied to crypto-native businesses.
  - Discussing unlock-vs-buyback dynamics as a market-structure lens.
- **DoNotUseFor**:
  - Treating any revenue, fees, buyback totals, market share, or unlock numbers as current.
  - Real-time trading decisions based on RSI/Fear & Greed or short-term positioning.
  - Any definitive claims about future Coinbase/ETF listings.
- **EvidenceNote**: Extracted from the Appendix; no new claims added.
- **Thesis**:
  - A lean team printing high cash flow at a low multiple can re-rate as access expands and the “token stigma” dissolves (as written).
  - Buyback/burn mechanics can structurally support price if revenues persist through unlock windows (as written).
- **Differentiators**:
  - Operational leverage (very low headcount vs high throughput) (as written).
  - Token design emphasizing buyback/burn rather than dividends (as written).
  - Market positioning as a fast, global, onchain derivatives venue (as written).
- **RisksAndUnknowns**:
  - Unlock-driven sell pressure and transparency gaps around allocations (explicit in Appendix).
  - Competition compressing fees and liquidity (explicit in Appendix).
  - Product execution risk on adjacent initiatives (HyperEVM) (explicit in Appendix).
  - Regulatory and access/onramp constraints delaying mainstream adoption (implied).
- **WatchlistTriggers**:
  - Unlock cadence vs net buybacks/burns over time (as written).
  - Sustained fee generation / market share trends in perps (as written).
  - Evidence of improved transparency around allocations and incentives (as written).
  - Quality/retention outcomes for HyperEVM launches (as written).

## Legacy Framework (original, verbatim)

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Valuation Dislocation:** Understanding the discrepancies between company valuations and their underlying performance metrics.
- **Market Perception vs. Reality:** Analyzing how market sentiment can skew the perception of value, particularly in emerging sectors like crypto.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Evaluating companies based on profit generation relative to employee count and growth rates.
- **Innovation in Trading Platforms:** Recognizing the shift from traditional brokerage models to decentralized trading solutions.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Employ comparative analysis to assess startups against established players in the industry. Focus on metrics like revenue per employee and growth rates. This will help identify undervalued opportunities in the market.
- Utilize a multi-dimensional framework that includes qualitative factors (e.g., user experience, market reach) alongside quantitative metrics to form a holistic view of a company's potential.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for signs of rapid growth in trading volume and user engagement, particularly in platforms that offer unique value propositions or leverage technology in innovative ways.
- Monitor changes in market accessibility, such as the integration of fiat currencies into crypto platforms, which can significantly influence adoption rates.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Apply a value-investing mindset by seeking out companies with strong fundamentals that are not yet recognized by traditional investors. Focus on those with a clear competitive advantage and operational efficiency.
- Consider the impact of regulatory changes and market dynamics on emerging financial technologies. Anticipate shifts in investor perception and be prepared to capitalize on them as barriers to entry diminish.

**Important Notes:**
- Maintain focus on methodologies and frameworks rather than specific historical data or metrics.
- Extract actionable insights that can apply to current and future investment decisions.
- Adapt this analytical approach to evaluate both established enterprises and emerging startups in the venture capital landscape.

## Appendix (original essay, verbatim)

---
Imagine a tiny 11-person startup that, in a single year, went from “Who?” to generating more than a billion dollars of real, audited cash flow — more annual profit than Delta Airlines, Airbnb, or DoorDash made at similar stages in their lives. Now imagine that same company is still valued cheaper than almost every public fintech or brokerage you already know — like Robinhood, Coinbase, or Charles Schwab. That company exists today. Its name is Hyperliquid, and almost nobody outside of crypto has heard of it yet. 

That’s about to change. First, the simple numbers everyone can understand.

In 2025, Hyperliquid will make $1 billion in revenue with 11 employees:

- 
Robinhood: $4.3 billion revenue, 7,600 employees

- 
Coinbase: $7.2 billion revenue, 3,400 employees

- 
Charles Schwab: $19 billion revenue, 32,000 employees

Hyperliquid makes about the same money per employee as Nvidia — the most profitable large company on Earth — except it’s growing five times faster than Nvidia did at the same age. Yet the stock market (and the crypto market) currently values Hyperliquid at roughly 11 times its earnings.

Robinhood trades at 50 times earnings.
Coinbase trades at 35 times.
Even sleepy old Schwab is 25 times.

You can buy a dollar of Hyperliquid’s profits for 11 cents, while you have to pay 35–50 cents for a dollar of Robinhood’s or Coinbase’s profits — even though Hyperliquid is growing much faster and has almost no employees to pay. That gap is one of the largest valuation dislocations in public markets today.

Okay, but what does Hyperliquid actually do?

Think of it as “Robinhood for the things Robinhood is afraid to list.”

Robinhood lets you trade Apple stock and Bitcoin with a pretty phone app.
Hyperliquid lets you trade Apple stock, Bitcoin, gold, oil, Tesla pre-market moves, or even the price of Nvidia on a random Tuesday in Taiwan — 24 hours a day, with up to 50× leverage, and it all settles in under half a second.

And unlike Robinhood, which is a middleman that sends your order to Citadel, Hyperliquid is the exchange itself — built entirely on a blockchain it created from scratch. There is no corporate office in Menlo Park, no compliance department of 400 people, no Super Bowl ads. Just code and servers.

The crazy part? Traders love it. In June 2025, more money changed hands on Hyperliquid in a single month than on Robinhood all year. By November, Hyperliquid was routinely doing $15 billion of trades in a single day — roughly the same as the New York Stock Exchange on a busy day.

All of this with essentially zero marketing.

Why haven’t you heard of it?

Two reasons most normal people miss:

- 
You can’t (yet) buy or sell on Hyperliquid with dollars from your Chase account. You have to move money through crypto first. That single extra step keeps 99 % of retail investors away — for now.

- 
The “stock” of Hyperliquid is a cryptocurrency called HYPE. Most traditional investors and financial media still treat anything ending in “coin” or “token” as gambling, not investing.

Both of those barriers are crumbling fast.

Robinhood itself listed HYPE for trading in October 2025. Coinbase is widely expected to follow in 2026. BlackRock, Fidelity, and several ETF issuers have already filed to create investment products that hold HYPE. Once your uncle can buy it in his IRA with one click, the “crypto” smell goes away overnight.

The closest historical analogy**

Think back to 2016–2017. A company named Square (now Block) was processing billions in payments for small businesses using phones and little white card readers. Wall Street valued it at 4–6 times sales because “it’s just a payments company in a crowded market.”

Then merchants realized Square was actually a software company with 90 % gross margins and network effects. The stock went up 30-fold in five years.

Hyperliquid today is where Square was in 2017 — except the margins are even higher (99 %), the growth is faster, and the addressable market (global derivatives = $2 quadrillion) is a thousand times bigger.

**The unlock controversy everyone is scared of**

Critics (and there are many) point to one big risk: starting this month (November 2025), early team members and investors are allowed to sell portions of their HYPE tokens every month for the next two years.

This is the same thing that happened to Coinbase and Robinhood when they went public — insiders sold stock and the prices dropped hard at first. The difference: Coinbase and Robinhood pay out dividends or buy back stock with 5–10 % of their profits.

Hyperliquid uses 97 % of every dollar of profit to buy back and burn HYPE tokens — automatically, every single day. In the last 12 months it has already repurchased $1 billion worth — more buybacks than Apple, Meta, and Nvidia combined in the same period.

In other words, the company is engineered to shrink its own share count even while new tokens come onto the market. If trading volume keeps growing (and it has grown every single month without fail for two years), the buybacks will eventually overwhelm the unlocks. That flywheel is already turning.

**Bottom line for non-crypto people**

You don’t need to understand blockchain or decentralized finance to see the opportunity. Hyperliquid is a high-speed global brokerage that:

- 
makes $1 billion+ a year,

- 
grows revenue 20–40 % per month,

- 
has almost no employees,

- 
and spends nearly every dollar it earns buying back its own stock.

**
It currently trades for roughly one-fourth the valuation multiple of Robinhood and one-third of Coinbase — companies growing half as fast with ten times the overhead. When Robinhood went public in 2021, it was hailed as the future of retail investing and immediately valued at 20 times sales. Hyperliquid is already bigger than Robinhood was on IPO day, yet still valued like a slow-growth regional bank. That won’t last. Whether you buy the token today, wait for the ETF, or just watch from the sidelines, one thing is almost certain: in five years, your friends who work in finance will be kicking themselves for missing “the Robinhood of the 2020s” while it was still cheap.

Sometimes the best investments are the ones that feel a little weird at first.
Hyperliquid feels weird today.
It won’t tomorrow.

The Hyperliquid Bear Case, Stripped Bare**

Open interest is still down 50%+ from October peaks with only partial recovery. Daily fees often sit below $1M versus summer highs. Aster and Lighter now lead 30-day volume with near-zero fees and deeper books. November saw 609K $HYPE sold OTC from team wallets, and monthly unlocks of $400M–$500M continue through 2026 with patchy transparency. TWAP selling pressure persists, most HyperEVM launches dump instantly, DATs provide no real liquidity, and the community still has zero visibility on the remaining 43% token allocation a full year after launch. The $MON ticker flip to Monad for $489K was an own goal. These are real cracks, not just memes.

**Why the Bears Are Probably Early**

Only 23% of the latest unlock was sold; 77% was restaked or held. Whales bought $18M pre-dip and Paradigm staked another $581M days before. Buybacks have already burned $900M+ in supply (more than Apple+Meta+Nvidia combined last year) and, at current run-rate, outpace unlocks because 97% of revenue flows straight back to the token. OI is already ticking up, TVL grew 337% in 2025, and Hyperliquid still owns 75% of DEX perps share with $2.74T yearly volume. HIP-3 slashed fees 90% for new markets and opened pre-IPO perps and aligned stables. Fear & Greed at 13 and RSI under 29 scream oversold.

**Bottom Line**

Unlock pain is priced in, competition is real, and HyperEVM needs work. But a lean 11-person team printing $1B annualized revenue with zero VC baggage at an 11x earnings multiple (half of Coinbase while growing 5× faster) in a $2 quadrillion derivatives market is not a regional bank. It is the clearest “weird now, obvious later” trade in crypto right now. If you skipped Robinhood at IPO (20x sales, half the size), don’t sleep on its on-chain heir.

$HYPE trades like a regional bank today. 

Tomorrow? The Robinhood of the 2020s. 

Weird now, obvious later. Your move.
