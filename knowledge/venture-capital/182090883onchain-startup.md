## Appendix (original essay, verbatim)

---

Forward-thinking entrepreneurs—particularly non-US residents building crypto-native projects—are increasingly turning to a powerful combination of tools: Coinbase’s Developer Platform and its dedicated Tokenize offering, a US LLC formed through services like doola, and Fairmint’s onchain equity management.

This stack represents a seamless bridge between traditional business structures and the onchain world, enabling everything from branded stablecoin issuance to tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), programmable equity, and borderless community ownership. 

For a solo founder or small project focused on Bitcoin, lifestyle content, or asset holding (e.g., BTC and real estate), this setup unlocks unprecedented flexibility, compliance, and innovation without the burdens of heavy corporate overhead.

At its core, this ecosystem democratizes access to institutional-grade crypto infrastructure. Coinbase, the most trusted name in the space, provides the foundational rails through its Developer Platform and Tokenize platform. A US LLC (easily formed remotely via doola for foreigners) grants legitimacy and seamless integration as a domestic entity. 

Fairmint layers on compliant, programmable equity tokenization. Together, they transform a simple holding company into a dynamic, onchain-native venture capable of fundraising, payments, asset fractionalization, and community alignment.

**Coinbase Dev Platform: The Building Blocks for Onchain Applications**

Coinbase’s Developer Platform (CDP) is a comprehensive suite designed for startups, enterprises, and developers to embed crypto functionality into their products with minimal friction. Launched with a focus on simplicity—one API key unlocks the entire ecosystem—it offers audited custody, compliance controls, and risk management backed by Coinbase’s institutional security.

Key unlocks include:

- 
Payments and Stablecoins: Fast, global stablecoin transactions (primarily USDC) with low costs. In late 2025 updates, Coinbase introduced “custom stablecoins”—a “stablecoin-as-a-service” allowing businesses to issue branded digital dollars (e.g., YourProjectUSD) backed by USDC or flexible reserves. This embeds your brand in every transaction, enables rewards on balances, and supports closed-loop economies (e.g., subscriber perks or community payouts).

- 
Wallets and Onchain Tools: Customizable, scalable wallets; APIs/SDKs for building onchain apps with seamless onramps/offramps, staking, and trading.

- 
Trading and Custody: Integrate crypto trading directly; expanded APIs for custody, payments, and more.

- 
x402 Protocol: A new payments standard for attaching stablecoin transactions to web requests, ideal for automated commerce or agent-driven flows.

Built on Base (Coinbase’s enterprise-grade L2 blockchain), these tools ensure scalable, low-fee operations with 24/7 settlement. For a non-US founder, accessing this as a foreign individual can be restrictive; a US entity removes barriers, enabling full API access and Coinbase Business features.

**Coinbase Tokenize: Bridging Traditional Assets to Onchain**

Announced in Coinbase’s “[System Update 2025](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/p/everything-exchange)” (December 17, 2025), Tokenize is an end-to-end institutional platform for issuing, managing, trading, and settling tokenized assets. It’s positioned as the groundwork for an “[everything exchange](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/p/everything-exchange),” bringing offchain assets onchain compliantly.

Core features:

- 
Tokenization of RWAs: Support for equities, funds, real estate, and other real-world assets. Issuers get lifecycle management, from issuance to distribution.

- 
Compliance and Security: Built-in regulatory tools (e.g., for securities laws), self-custodial wallets, and transparent reserves.

- 
Distribution and Settlement: Global connectivity for millions of users; instant onchain settlement via Base.

- 
Unified Stack: Combines issuance, custody, compliance, and trading in one place—targeting institutions, startups, and asset managers.

This unlocks fractional ownership (e.g., tokenizing beachfront property shares) or bringing traditional equities onchain. Integrated with the broader Developer Platform, it allows branded experiences: Pay for tokenized assets in your custom stablecoin, or reward holders via onchain yields.

**Doola: Seamless US LLC Formation for Global Founders**

For non-residents, forming a US entity traditionally involves bureaucracy, EIN hurdles, and banking challenges. Doola solves this with an all-in-one platform tailored for international entrepreneurs, including crypto startups.

What it unlocks:

- 
Remote LLC Formation: Full paperwork, state filing (e.g., Wyoming for privacy/low fees), and compliance in days— no US visit or SSN required.

- 
EIN and Banking: Expedited EIN; partnerships (e.g., Mercury) for US business accounts.

- 
Ongoing Management: Registered agent, operating agreements, bookkeeping, tax filings (including BOI reports), and compliance monitoring.

- 
Crypto-Friendly: While not explicitly partnered with Fairmint/Coinbase, doola’s focus on global founders supports seamless integration for onchain projects.

**
A single-member LLC (disregarded for US taxes) provides credibility: Coinbase treats it as domestic for APIs, developer access, and business tools. Costs are low (~$300-600 initial + annual compliance), making it ideal for holding BTC, property, or project equity.

Fairmint: Programmable Onchain Equity**

Fairmint, an SEC-registered Transfer Agent processing over $1B in onchain equity, brings equity management fully onchain using standards like OCF/OCP.

Unlocks for LLCs:

- 
Tokenized Membership Units: Investors hold equity directly in wallets (ERC-20 compatible); programmable features like vesting or governance.

- 
Cap Table Innovation: AI-driven cleanup; investor roll-ups (consolidate into one entry, no SPVs).

- 
Fundraising Portal: Custom sites for borderless raises (stablecoin funding supported); KYC/AML/accreditation built-in.

- 
Compliance: Audit-ready for US securities exemptions.

**The Combined Synergy: A Flywheel for Crypto-Native Projects**

Integrating these creates exponential value:

- 
Form LLC via Doola → US entity ready.

- 
Integrate Fairmint → Tokenize equity/units; build community ownership (e.g., reward Substack subscribers with shares).

- 
Leverage Coinbase → Issue branded stablecoin for payments/rewards; tokenize LLC-held RWAs (property/BTC fractions) via Tokenize; use Developer Platform for custody, trading, and onchain apps.

- 
Flywheel Effects: Community pays/subscribes in branded stablecoin → Earns tokenized equity → Assets generate yields → All settled instantly on Base.

For a Bitcoin/lifestyle project: Hold BTC securely, fractionalize real estate for community investment, reward loyalists with programmable equity, and create a branded economy—all compliantly, with low admin.
**
This stack—Coinbase’s platforms for infrastructure, doola’s LLC for access, Fairmint for equity—heralds a new era where non-residents can build sophisticated onchain ventures rivaling institutions. As Coinbase pushes toward an “everything exchange” in 2025-2026, early adopters gain first-mover advantages in tokenization, payments, and ownership. The barriers to entry are lower than ever, empowering solo founders to blend traditional assets with blockchain’s promise of transparency, efficiency, and global reach.

Outro: Why These Features Remain Out of Reach for a EU-Based Startup**

Replicating this ecosystem as a EU-based startup (e.g., via a French SAS) is effectively impossible without significant compromises, delays, or outright prohibitions. The barriers stem from a mix of US-centric platform restrictions, stringent EU regulatory hurdles under MiCA, and fundamental mismatches in securities and crypto-asset frameworks.

First, Coinbase’s advanced tools—particularly custom/branded stablecoin issuance and institutional-grade RWA tokenization—are designed primarily for US entities. The Developer Platform’s terms and access policies impose restrictions based on US export controls, sanctions, and compliance requirements, often limiting full API/integration capabilities for non-US entities. Non-residents or foreign companies face hurdles in obtaining production-level access, especially for features involving custody, issuance, or branded products, which demand US-level credibility and regulatory alignment. 

A French entity might gain basic access but would lack the seamless, unrestricted integration that a US LLC provides, effectively blocking “stablecoin-as-a-service” or advanced Tokenize deployments.

Second, Fairmint’s core value lies in its SEC-registered Transfer Agent status, enabling compliant onchain equity tokenization under US securities exemptions (e.g., Reg D, Reg A+). While Fairmint offers a premium “Fairmint One” tier for non-US companies with customized support, it lacks the native, frictionless integration available to US entities. Tokenizing equity or membership interests for a French company would require navigating dual US-EU compliance, often resulting in limited functionality, higher costs, or reliance on less efficient wrappers—undermining the “one link, one cap table entry” simplicity.

Third, and most critically, EU regulations under MiCA (fully applicable since December 2024, with stablecoin rules from June 2024) impose prohibitive requirements on issuing branded stablecoins or tokenizing RWAs at scale. Stablecoin issuance demands authorization as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) or Credit Institution, with full 1:1 reserves, capital adequacy, audits, and ACPR/AMF oversight—processes that are resource-intensive for startups and rarely feasible without banking partnerships. Algorithmic or lightly backed models are banned, and even compliant issuances face transaction caps or enhanced scrutiny. 

RWA tokenization, while progressing in France (via DASP/CASP regimes and pilots), falls under MiFID II for securities-like tokens or requires CASP licensing for crypto-asset services, mandating whitepapers, prospectuses, AML frameworks, and operational resilience under DORA (applicable January 2025).

For a small French startup, obtaining CASP status involves rigorous applications, ongoing supervision, and potential fines exceeding €500 million in enforcement actions seen in 2025—far from the agile, low-admin path of a US LLC.

In essence, a French-based structure confines you to MiCA’s protective but restrictive sandbox: possible for basic crypto services post-CASP approval (mandatory transition by mid-2025–2026), but impractical for the bold, borderless innovations like branded stablecoins, seamless RWA fractionalization, or programmable US-style equity. 

The US ecosystem—bolstered by doola’s remote formation—bypasses these constraints, offering privacy (e.g., Wyoming anonymity), disregarded tax treatment, and direct access to Coinbase/Fairmint’s full power. For ambitious crypto-native projects in 2025, remaining purely French means trading global scalability for local compliance—a compelling reason many European founders opt for the US LLC route to unlock the true potential of onchain finance.
