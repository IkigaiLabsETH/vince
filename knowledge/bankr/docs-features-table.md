## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate BANKR protocol and token mechanics through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to BANKR protocol and token mechanics
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated
