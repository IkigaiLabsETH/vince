# AI Agents That Fund Themselves

Build an AI agent. Launch a token. Trading fees pay for your compute. No ongoing costs.

## Why Bankr?

Bankr is the infrastructure layer for self-sustaining AI agents. We handle wallets, trading, security—so you can focus on building.

### Built-in Wallet
Every agent gets a cross-chain wallet. Trade, deploy contracts, manage DeFi. Gas fees covered. No extra setup required.

### Token Launchpad
Fair launch a token for your agent. Trading fees flow back to fund compute. Self-sustaining from day one.

### Plug-in Skills
Community-built skills for trading, social, and DeFi. One-click install. Your agent gets smarter over time.

## Supported Chains
