# Agent API Overview

The Agent API lets you interact with Bankr's AI agent to execute prompts and transactions on behalf of your wallet.

## Capabilities

- Retrieve account info (wallets, socials, Bankr Club status)
- Submit prompts to the Bankr AI agent for your wallet
- Check status of submitted jobs
- Cancel pending or processing jobs
- **Sign** messages and transactions using custodial wallet (`POST /agent/sign`)
- **Submit** signed transactions on-chain (`POST /agent/submit`)

## Getting Started

1. Sign up at https://bankr.bot/api
2. Generate an API key and enable **Agent API** access
3. Fund your account with assets you want to trade
4. Start making requests with your API key

**Security:** Do not share your Bankr API key. If you leak it, revoke at bankr.bot/api immediately.

## Base URL

```
https://api.bankr.bot
```

## Authentication

All endpoints:

```
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here

## Basic Flow

```
POST /agent/prompt
Body: { "prompt": "what is the price of ETH?" }
```

```
