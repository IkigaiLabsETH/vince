## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate BANKR protocol and token mechanics through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to BANKR protocol and token mechanics
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated

# Bankr Features — Prompt Phrasings (Ingested)

Source: docs.bankr.bot/features (Portfolio, Transfers, NFTs, Leveraged Trading, DCA, TWAP, Stop Orders, Limit Orders, Swaps, Features Table)

These phrasings are sent to Bankr via **BANKR_AGENT_PROMPT**. Forward the user's message as the prompt. Order management (list, status, cancel) uses BANKR_ORDER_LIST, BANKR_ORDER_STATUS, BANKR_ORDER_CANCEL.

**Features Table:** The [Features Table](https://docs.bankr.bot/features/features-table) is the complete reference: Trading, Automations, Token Launching, Leveraged, Polymarket, Portfolio, Transfers, NFTs, Market Data, Staking, and chain-specific notes. Capability areas and chains: Trading (all chains), Automations / limit-stop-DCA-TWAP (EVM), Token Launching (Base, Solana), Leveraged / Avantis (Base), Polymarket (Polygon), Portfolio & Balances (all), Transfers (all), NFTs (EVM: Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Unichain; not Solana), Market Data (all), Staking (Base). Use it to answer "what can Bankr do?" and "which chains for X?"
