Bitcoin sits at ninety-one thousand dollars, bleeding quietly after kissing one hundred twenty-six thousand in October. The timeline is pure carnage porn: thirty-six billion in longs liquidated, Fear & Greed stuck at twenty-eight, and X turned into a Roman circus where half the crowd screams “goblin town” and the other half is already stacking sats with trembling hands.

This is not the end.
This is the intermission.

## Context

Every single Bitcoin cycle has followed the same four-act play:

- Quiet accumulation before the halving

- Parabolic euphoria 12–18 months after the halving

## Main

- Blow-off top (check—October 6, day 537 post-halving, textbook)

- The mellow bear: a slow, rational-looking 40–70 % drawdown that convinces everyone the movie is over

We are fifty-five days into Act 4, and the script is running on rails.

> On X, the doomers are poetic. They post death crosses, descending triangles, and 2021 fractals like religious icons. They see fifty-five thousand, forty-five thousand, even twenty-eight thousand by 2028. They are not wrong about the shape; they are only wrong about the ending. Because while retail is busy vomiting, the adults in the room are licking their chops.

JPMorgan just called this dip the bottom and raised their 2026 target to $170,000. Goldman whispers $200,000. Standard Chartered screams $300,000. Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer runs Metcalfe’s Law and calmly says one million dollars per coin by the late 2030s, but they’re buying right now. VanEck, Citigroup, Bernstein, Ark—all of them have six-figure targets locked and loaded for the next eighteen months.

These are not degenerate leverage bros. These are the same firms that used to call Bitcoin “rat poison squared.” Now they file uncapped-upside structured notes tied to BlackRock’s ETF through 2028, hold 773,000 BTC in custody, and execute basis trades on every dip because the carry is free and the asymmetry is obscene.

BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick summed it up best: Bitcoin is no longer a payments experiment. It is digital gold with a call option on the entire financial system. And they just launched the European version of IBIT because the old continent finally wants in.

Meanwhile, sovereign wealth funds are tiptoeing: Norway disclosed 2,147 BTC, Abu Dhabi tripled its MicroStrategy stake, Arizona pensions are in, El Salvador never stopped buying. ETF assets are already past $150 billion and still growing. That is permanent, price-insensitive capital. The kind that doesn’t flinch at a thirty percent drawdown.

X feels like a bloodbath because retail always bleeds first. But the whales just had their most active week of the year—102,900 transactions over $100k. Long-term holders moved 815,000 BTC in the last month and didn’t sell. Miners hoarded 777 BTC last week instead of dumping. The smart money isn’t scared; it’s hungry.

The 200-week moving average—the one line Bitcoin has kissed or undercut in every single bear market—sits at fifty-six thousand today and climbs twelve hundred dollars a week. By mid-2026 it will be near seventy thousand. That is the final boss level. That is where the mellow bear goes to die.

History says we get there. Institutional flow says we don’t stay there long. Quantitative tightening ends tomorrow. Two to three hundred billion in fresh liquidity hits Q1 from the Treasury drawdown alone. A new Fed chair lands mid-2026 and the market has already priced in seventy-five to one hundred basis points of cuts. Inflation is cooling, PMI is contracting, cash allocations are at fifteen-year lows. The macro table is set for risk assets to feast.

The loudest voices on X are right about one thing: the next six to twelve months will hurt. They are dead wrong about what comes after.

Wall Street has already written the sequel, and the title is not “Bear Market Forever.” It’s “Digital Gold Takes the Throne.”

The mellow bear is growling.
The institutions are smiling.

## Conclusion

And the greatest wealth transfer of our lifetime is still in its early innings.

Enjoy the show.
