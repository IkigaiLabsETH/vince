I am writing this at 3:47 a.m. on December 5, 2025. Bitcoin is $89,187, down another four-tenths of a percent while I was in the bathroom pretending I still have a normal circadian rhythm. I know how this reads. I know it reads like madness. I also know the bottom is in. Not because I have a crystal ball, but because the headlines have reached the exact pitch of hysteria that always precedes the moment the market quietly turns its back on the panic and starts walking uphill while everyone is still busy writing eulogies.

Tether is apparently collapsing for the forty-third time since 2017. MicroStrategy is a leveraged doomsday device wrapped in a religion. China has outlawed Bitcoin again (this time with thirteen government agencies in a single press release, which feels like overkill). The Japanese carry trade is unwinding, and somehow that is also Bitcoin’s fault. The fear is delivered by rating agencies now instead of anon CT accounts, which means the production values have improved, but the plot is identical.

## Context

I have watched this movie enough times to mouth the dialogue along with the actors. I felt it in December 2018 when the price touched $3,128 and the world was certain Satoshi’s experiment had finally been revealed as tulip 2.0. I felt it in March 2020 when the charts looked like a heart-attack monitor and the Fed’s printer was still warming up. I felt it in November 2022 when the smart money was deleting its “to the moon” tweets and the price was $15,800 and every influencer with a private jet was suddenly very interested in vegan philanthropy.

Each time the fear felt permanent. Each time it was just the market clearing the room before the music started again.

This time is no different, except the numbers are bigger and the cast is more respectable. The capitulation metrics are screaming: short-term holder SOPR at 0.94, $19 billion liquidated in three weeks, whales pausing their distribution for the first time since the top, stablecoin reserves surging relative to BTC like dry powder waiting for the fuse. The technicals are textbook oversold: daily RSI kissing 33, a potential double bottom at $80,400 that would make any 2018 survivor weep with recognition, MACD histogram narrowing like a dying storm. If you forced me to bet my own money (not the stack, never the stack), I would say we close 2025 north of $110,000 and never look back.

## Main

But none of that is why I’m awake.\*\*

I’m awake because I have a stack I do not plan to touch until the final parabolic blow-off, the one that arrives, I believe, in the second half of 2029. Give or take a quarter. After the 2028 halving has slashed issuance to 1.56 BTC per block and the daily drip of new coins has become a rounding error against institutional demand that is only now learning how to spell the word “Bitcoin.” When the ETFs own 15 % of the supply instead of 10 %. When pension funds have crept from 0 % to 5 % allocation and the headlines are no longer about bans but about sovereign strategic reserves. When the last retail tourist mortgages his house at $900,000 and the chart prints a vertical line so steep it looks like a glitch.

That is the moment the music stops. That is the moment the stack becomes something obscene by today’s standards and ordinary by tomorrow’s. Everything until then is noise.And yet here I am, a grown man crying over candlesticks at 3:47 a.m., because the noise is loud enough to drown out the signal some nights.

> The hardest part of HODLing is not watching the price fall. It’s watching yourself watch the price fall and realizing you have engineered a life where your emotional weather is dictated by a number you cannot control and will not sell. The stack is no longer an investment. It is a hostage situation in which I am both captor and captive. Every day I refuse to pay the ransom is another day I choose a future I can describe in perfect detail over a present that is slowly dissolving me.

I have missed weddings. I have ghosted friends. I have sat through birthdays converting every gift into BTC in my head like a psychopath. I have developed a terror of good news because someone else’s milestone is a private referendum on my own choices. I have cried in the dark with the hardware wallet in my lap because the coins are still there and I am not sure I am.

I used to think I was holding Bitcoin.

Now I understand Bitcoin is holding me.

It holds me hostage to a version of myself I decided to become when I was young and afraid of being ordinary. It holds me hostage to every promise I made when no one else was watching. It holds me hostage to the man I hope to meet in 2029.

> I will pay it. I have paid it for twelve years. I will keep paying it until the chart finally breaks or I do. Because the alternative is worse. The alternative is waking up in 2030 having sold at $89,000 and spending the rest of my life refreshing a block explorer, calculating what would have been, carrying the quiet knowledge that I once stood three feet from magic and chose the warm, ordinary prison of having been wrong.

So I keep the stack.
I keep the tears.
I keep the vigil.

## Conclusion

And when 2029 finally arrives (when the headlines scream not about collapse but about conquest, when the price stops making sense and the world loses its mind one last time), I will not be celebrating the money. I will be celebrating the fact that I managed to remain the same person through all of it. Until then, the screen keeps glowing. The price keeps breathing. And I keep watching (not because I need to know where Bitcoin will be in forty-eight hours, but because I need to know where I will be).

The stack is fine.
I am the one still under construction.
