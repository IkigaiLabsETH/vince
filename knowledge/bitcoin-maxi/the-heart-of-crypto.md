I still remember the first time I ran Bitcoin Core on a shitty laptop in 2013 and watched the entire monetary history of a new planet download in front of me. Block after block, transaction after transaction, every single satoshi that had ever moved, laid bare. It was obscene in its nakedness. There was nowhere to hide. And that was the entire point.

That publicness felt like the first honest money humans had ever invented. No central bank could cook its books. No dictator could print a trillion units in a weekend and pretend no one would notice. Every abuse would be visible to anyone who cared to look. The ledger was merciless, and therefore trustworthy.

## Context

For years that was the sermon: “Don’t trust, verify.” Transparency wasn’t a trade-off; it was the whole revolution.Then something started happening in the real world.People got robbed because their addresses were public. Teenagers in Venezuela had their savings confiscated because a chain-analysis firm sold a graph to a desperate government. A charity in Canada had its donation address blacklisted by a payment processor because some coins that passed through it once touched a darknet market in 2014. A sex worker in Uganda lost her only bank account because an exchange flagged her for “high-risk” on-chain patterns.

Suddenly the sermon started to sound a little psychopathic. “Yes, the ledger is honest, but now everyone can see you’re poor or a dissident, or just someone who once bought weed.” The transparency that made the system incorruptible also made its users naked in front of every predator with a blockchain explorer.

So the counter-sermon was born: “Privacy is a human right. Cash never ratted you out. Real money is bearer money. If your coins can be tainted by their past, they’re not money, they’re probationary scrip.”

## Main

And thus the war began.

On one side: the transparency maximalists—mostly Bitcoiners, some Ethereum OGs—who insist the chain must remain fully public forever, because any dark pool is a vector for corruption, inflation bugs, or regulatory capture.

On the other side: the privacy maximalists—Monero cultists, Zcash idealists, cypherpunks with pirate flags—who say selective disclosure is a fantasy, optional privacy is no privacy, and that fungibility without blindness is just a prettier form of CBDC.

Both sides are right. Both sides are armed. And both sides hate each other more than they hate banks.

I have belonged to both churches. I have excommunicated and been excommunicated. I have written manifestos defending public blockchains as the ultimate disinfectant and, years later, written other manifestos calling public blockchains weapons of mass financial surveillance. I am not proud of the whiplash, but I’m not ashamed either. The contradiction lives in the world, not in my head.

Here is the wound we keep picking at: Bitcoin solved verifiability but completely failed at confidentiality. Everything that came after has been a frantic attempt to patch one or the other, usually by breaking something sacred in the process.

Zcash is the perfect scar tissue. It tried to square the circle—optional privacy via zero-knowledge proofs. You could shield your transactions if you wanted, or not. A cryptographic libertarian’s dream.

In practice it was a tragedy. Shielded transactions were slow, memory-intensive, and most wallets and exchanges refused to touch them. The privacy pool stayed tiny. Regulators treated Zcash as a privacy coin anyway and delisted it. Users treated it as a transparent coin because that was easier. Ten years later, less than 1% of ZEC ever moves through the shielded pool on any given day. The dream of “civil liberties preserved through mathematics” died of network effects and fear.

Monero took the opposite bet: mandatory privacy, no opt-out, no compromises. It worked—Monero is genuinely private—but the cost was a permanent regulatory bullseye and a culture that sometimes feels like a doomsday prepper compound. It’s the cash of crypto, but it’s cash that can’t walk into most stores.

And so we arrive at the present malaise: everyone senses that something essential is missing, but no one can agree on what to mourn.

The transparency people mourn the loss of the pristine, auditable ledger—the one thing that made this experiment different from the fiat shell games.

The privacy people mourn the loss of the last refuge from a world that is criminalizing disobedience one KYC form at a time.

Both are mourning the same thing, actually: the death of the original promise that we could have trustless money that was also free.

We can’t. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

There is no known way to give seven billion people private, verifiable, censorship-resistant, globally accessible money without someone—somewhere—being able to see something they shouldn’t. Every proposed solution sacrifices either the privacy or the verifiability or the usability or the decentralization. Pick two, maybe two-and-a-half on a good day.

This is not an engineering footnote. This is the central political fact of our time in crypto.

Every year the trade-off gets sharper. Cash is dying. China has its digital yuan. The IRS wants a wallet address for every $600 Venmo. Chain-analysis companies are hiring faster than protocol labs. The transparent chains are becoming panopticons with extra steps. The private chains are becoming ghettos.

And still we argue about which failure mode is more noble.

But now, in late 2025, the argument has gotten louder—and more institutional. Even the suits are starting to whisper doubts. Take VanEck, the ETF powerhouse that’s been stacking Bitcoin exposure since the early days. Their CEO, Jan van Eck, went on CNBC this week and dropped a bomb that shook the timeline: the Bitcoin community is “focusing on two core issues: crypto security and privacy, especially in the face of potential threats from quantum computing.” He didn’t mince words: “We will walk away from Bitcoin if we think the thesis is fundamentally broken.”

This isn’t some degen shitposter farming engagement. This is a $100B+ asset manager signaling that Bitcoin’s emperor might have no clothes—or at least, clothes that a quantum computer could slice through like butter. X lit up like a fireworks show. Threads dissected every syllable: “VanEck FUD incoming?” “Quantum’s the new black swan.” One Zcash maxi quipped, “Bitcoin can’t pull off both privacy & quantum-resistance in time... It’s Zcash or nothing.”

Another Bitcoiner fired back: “Quantum breaks ECDSA for everyone, not just BTC... Transparency is exactly what a neutral reserve asset should have.”

VanEck’s been circling this for months. Back in June, their head of digital assets research, Matt Sigel, warned of a “brief but critical ‘uncertainty window’” for Bitcoin to adapt to quantum threats—a gap between a breakthrough announcement and network-wide upgrades that could leave funds exposed. They even launched a Quantum Computing UCITS ETF in May, betting big on the tech that’s supposedly coming for Bitcoin’s throat.

Now, with the CEO echoing Vitalik Buterin’s recent nudge about quantum machines possibly arriving before 2030, it’s clear: institutions aren’t just holding Bitcoin anymore. They’re auditing it, and the privacy hole—coupled with quantum’s shadow—is starting to look like a dealbreaker.

Privacy first: Bitcoin’s ledger is a fishbowl. Every UTXO, every mix attempt, every Lightning zap—it’s all there for the IRS, the hackers, the jealous ex. Chainalysis sells dossiers on your spending habits. Governments blacklist addresses like it’s a no-fly list for money. VanEck’s called it out bluntly: “Whether the network offers enough privacy for users who don’t want their activity exposed.”

And the X swarm agrees—OG holders are eyeing Zcash’s shielded pools, where ZK proofs let you prove without revealing. “Bitcoin is vulnerable to future quantum attacks, fully traceable on-chain, and lacks true privacy,” one thread lamented, before shilling ZEC bids.

It’s not paranoia; it’s pattern-matching. As one post put it, “The quantum FUD plays on fear but ignores the timeline... Those old wallets? Most used P2PK which quantum could theoretically crack.”

Quantum’s the sharper knife. Shor’s algorithm could crack ECDSA signatures, exposing private keys from public ones. Not SHA-256—that’s Grover’s problem, a sqrt slowdown, not a death sentence. But ECDSA? Yeah, that’s toast on a fault-tolerant quantum rig with millions of qubits. We’re at thousands of noisy ones today. Estimates vary: decades away, per Adam Back; maybe 2030s, per Vitalik. VanEck’s worry isn’t the tech—it’s the window. A surprise breakthrough, a high-profile hack, and boom: panic migrations, volatility spikes, institutions bolting.

“Even a single high-profile theft could cause market volatility and trigger a scramble to upgrade,” Sigel wrote.

Bitcoin can adapt—soft forks for post-quantum signatures like Dilithium or Falcon are on the roadmap, NIST standards are maturing, and wallets are testing quantum-safe formats.

But decentralization is a double-edged sword. Ethereum or banks can patch centrally; Bitcoin needs miner buy-in, dev consensus, user upgrades. If quantum Q-Day hits early, that “uncertainty window” could be weeks, not years. X is full of it: “Quantum FUD is back... The real danger isn’t quantum. It’s the use of quantum as a narrative weapon.”

Ray Dalio piled on Squawk Box, and suddenly it’s not just cypherpunks—it’s Bridgewater and VanEck turning the volume to 11.

I no longer know which side I’m on, only that both feel like amputations.

Some days I think the Bitcoiners are right: keep the base layer pure, crystalline, naked. Let a thousand privacy layers bloom on top—CoinJoin, Ark, Fedimints, silent payments, ZK rollups. Let the ledger stay honest even if the users have to wrap themselves in seven layers of cryptography to touch it. Quantum? Migrate early, deprecate old sigs, and watch the dust settle.

Other days I think the degens are right: if privacy is optional, it will be regulated and UX’d out of existence. The only way to win is to burn the transparency and salt the earth so no one can ever claw it back. And quantum? Build it in from day one, like Zcash’s Halo 2 proofs that bake resistance into the protocol.

Most days I think both are wrong, that we’re all just rearranging deck chairs on a ship that already hit the iceberg called “scale.” Now with VanEck’s FUD echoing across CNBC and X—pushing Zcash narratives, quantum timelines, and exit threats—it’s clear the war’s gone mainstream. Institutions aren’t believers; they’re allocators. If the thesis wobbles, they walk. And that scares me more than any qubit.

But here is what I do know, because I feel it in my gut every time someone new discovers this space and asks the question you just asked: The fact that it still hurts means we haven’t fully capitulated yet.

As long as there are people who look at a blockchain and feel betrayed—either because it reveals too much or because it hides too much, because it’s hackable by tomorrow’s supercomputer or surveilled by today’s regulators—we still have a chance to build something that doesn’t force the next generation to choose which part of their humanity to abandon.

The war between transparency and privacy isn’t just a culture war anymore. It’s a boardroom debate, with quantum lurking like a ghost in the machine. It’s a love story with a messy divorce—and now, uninvited guests at the ceremony.

We loved the same dream once: money that couldn’t lie to us and couldn’t rat us out. We just woke up one morning and discovered those two desires might be incompatible at scale. Or quantum-proof. Or both.

## Conclusion

The people who still lose sleep over that incompatibility are the only ones who ever understood what was at stake.

So stay torn. It’s the only decent thing to do.
