## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):** The significance of the 50-week and 200-week SMAs as critical indicators in market cycles.
- **Market Cycle Analysis:** Understanding the distinct phases of market cycles through historical precedents.
- **Technical Confirmation:** The importance of consistent technical signals that validate market trends and forecasts.
- **Macro Context:** Recognizing the influence of broader economic conditions on cryptocurrency price movements.
- **Behavioral Indicators:** Assessing market sentiment through retail participation and institutional trends.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Emphasize a multi-faceted analysis that combines technical indicators with market psychology. Focus on historical patterns and adapt strategies based on the behavior of key moving averages. This involves an awareness of both quantitative data (e.g., SMA levels) and qualitative factors (e.g., market sentiment indicators).

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for repeated behaviors in market cycles, particularly concerning the interactions with the 50-week and 200-week SMAs. Notable signals include consecutive weekly closes below the 50-week SMA indicating a bear market initiation, and the resilience of the 200-week SMA as a support level during downturns. Recognize the absence of retail enthusiasm and other liquidity indicators as precursors to market shifts.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Develop a robust decision-making framework that prioritizes long-term trends over short-term fluctuations. Utilize historical benchmarks to guide expectation management, applying a conservative approach during technical breakdowns. Regularly evaluate macroeconomic signals to contextualize market movements, adjusting strategies to align with emerging trends rather than riding speculative waves.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates. 
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations. 
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

We are now three weeks into the wreckage. Bitcoin has fallen forty percent from its November high near $125,000, the weekly chart has closed below the 50-week simple moving average for the third consecutive time, and the loudest, most battle-tested voices in technical crypto analysis have all reached the same reluctant conclusion: the bull market that began in November 2022 is over. 
> 
Peter Brandt, the 50-year classical chartist who has called every major Bitcoin top since 2013 with eerie precision, posted a single line on December 2: “This bear market will last months.” 

Ansem, the altcoin oracle who once turned $8 million into $300 million on Solana ecosystem calls, now speaks of “year four of a ten-year bear market” because the total altcoin market cap never made a new all-time high. 

## Context

Ben Cowen, the PhD engineer whose entire brand is built on refusing to speculate beyond the data, raised his probability of a confirmed cycle top from 50 % in October to 70 % by late November after the 50-week SMA rule triggered exactly as it always has. 

Different methodologies, different personalities, one identical verdict. This is not the usual mid-cycle shakeout that the perma-bulls have learned to buy with religious fervor. The technical confirmations are too clean, the historical precedents too consistent, and the macro backdrop too ambiguous for the old “just capitulation, bro” narrative to hold water this time. 

The 50-week and 200-week simple moving averages deserve to be the centerpiece of any honest post-mortem, because they are the only indicators that have maintained a perfect track record across five complete Bitcoin cycles.

## Main

The 50-week SMA has acted as the bull market’s floor during every expansion phase and, when decisively broken with two or more consecutive weekly closes beneath it, has marked the exact moment the party ended in 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021. 

The 200-week SMA, by contrast, has never been broken on a closing basis in Bitcoin’s fifteen-year history and has caught every major bear-market low with almost mechanical precision: $170 in 2015, $3,200 in 2018, the brief COVID wick in 2020, and $15,500 in 2022. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades more than fourteen percent below a declining 50-week SMA and more than forty percent above a 200-week SMA that is still quietly grinding higher at roughly seven hundred dollars per week. 

Translation: the top is in, the bear market has begun, and the eventual low (most likely in the fourth quarter of 2026) will be found somewhere between fifty-five thousand and seventy-five thousand dollars when price finally kisses the rising 200-week line one more time. 

The reasons the top arrived when it did are now obvious in hindsight. There was no retail euphoria, no Coinbase signup spike, no ETH all-time high, no Google Trends parabolic blow-off, no taxi drivers asking about Solana. Institutional front-running via ETFs and MicroStrategy convertible notes pulled the entire move forward, leaving the traditional late-cycle mania phase stillborn. 

The parabola that began in 2022 was the shallowest in Bitcoin history, exactly as Peter Brandt’s exponential-decay model predicted, and it violated downward on November 11 with textbook symmetry to every prior cycle. 

Ansem’s structural argument is equally sobering. If the total cryptocurrency market cap excluding Bitcoin never managed a new high, then 2025 was nothing more than an echo bubble inside a longer secular bear that began in late 2021. The speculation peak happened years ago; everything since has been distribution disguised as innovation. 

Ben Cowen’s data-driven lament is perhaps the most painful for those who lived through it: this was the first cycle in which Bitcoin dominance rose aggressively in the second year after the halving instead of collapsing into an altcoin season. The promised rotation never came. Alts bled quietly for eighteen months while everyone kept waiting for the magic that arrived like clockwork in 2017 and 2021. It simply never showed up. 

Chris Burniske, ever the balanced venture capitalist, refuses to declare the secular crypto thesis broken. He calls the current environment a “mid-bull pullback” inside Carlota Perez’s longer technological surge cycle and reminds us that the really transformative gains still lie ahead in the 2030s deployment phase. Yet even he has been trimming into strength and raising cash because, in his words, “this cycle has been disappointing for most.” 

So where does this leave us? It leaves us exactly where every prior cycle has left the survivors: bruised, poorer on paper, and staring at a multi-year bear market that will feel endless until it suddenly isn’t. 

The good news is that the script is already written. Bitcoin will grind lower for most of 2026, the 200-week moving average will keep rising to meet it, and somewhere around October or November of next year the final capitulation candle will print within a few percent of that ascending blue line. 

A new halving will be eighteen months away, the ETFs will still be accumulating, nation-states and corporations will still be adding to their stacks, and the few who managed to preserve capital will deploy it at prices that will feel obscene in retrospect. 

The cycle is dead.
Long live the cycle. 

The bears have the baton now, and history says they will not relinquish it until the 200-week SMA has done its sacred work once more. Those who understand this will not enjoy the next twelve to eighteen months, but they will survive them. Those who refuse to understand it will be taught the same lesson that every prior bear market has taught the hopeful, the leveraged, and the late: Bitcoin always returns to its long-term moving averages. Always. 

Yes, the 50-week SMA is still broken and the cycle-top odds remain 60–70 %. But the past 48 hours just flipped the short-term script: Bitcoin reclaimed key supports, shorts got torched, ETF inflows flipped green, QT ends tomorrow, and December seasonality is undefeated.

This is the exact setup for the Santa Claus rally we have documented on our SubStack. Base case: $108K–$112K by New Year’s Eve, alts tag 20–50 % beta, then the real bear market resumes in Q1 2026 and takes us down to the rising 200-week SMA (~$60K–$70K) sometime next October–December.

Trade the month you’re in, not the cycle you wish you had. Stack aggressively on any dip under $90K, book profits into year-end strength, and keep dry powder for when the 200-week finally rings the bell.

## Conclusion

Santa is real.
The bear is just waiting until January.

Merry Christmas, see you at $108K.
