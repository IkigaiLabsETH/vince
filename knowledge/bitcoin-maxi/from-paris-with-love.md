If you’re thinking of moving to France, planning to live the life, stop scrolling for that stone house in Provence. Read this first, before you move out the USA.

Because the French State has a very special welcome package waiting for you — and if you ever get fed up and eye the exit, they’ve got a parting gift too. 

## Context

Oh, and that postcard-perfect hop down south to Portugal? Spoiler: It’s starting to look like a temporary tan, not a permanent fix. France will happily collect the second bite via exit tax, wealth tax, succession rules, or reassessments. 

Every single time you want to live the good life, you’ll pay:

- 
Sell a sliver of BTC to buy a car? → 30 % flat tax.

## Main

- 
Spend the proceeds on literally anything? → 20 % VAT on top. 

And for this obscene tribute, the Republic will give you… 

Exactly zero rights. No pension credits. No healthcare. No matter how many decades you spend drinking fine wine on their soil and keeping their villages alive with your spending. While you’re busy financing half the new tram line in Bordeaux, the civil servant who paid less tax in forty years than you did on moving day will retire at 62 on a fat indexed pension. 

You? Private insurance and crossed fingers.

This isn’t a welfare state.
This is contributory theatre with a baguette and a smirk.

And the punchline arrives January 1, 2026: France will now tax 1 % per year on your unrealised gains because, in their infinite wisdom, BTC is an “unproductive asset” (right next to gold, art, and second homes).

Meanwhile, the same government is quietly drafting plans for a national Bitcoin reserve of 420,000 BTC, because apparently the State’s coins are very productive, but yours are just lazy luxury toys that need shaving.

So congratulations, future French FIRE enthusiast: You’re too rich for handouts, too “non-contributory” for rights, and now officially too Bitcoin to be left alone. You will become the perfect 2025 cash cow: milked on entry, milked on every transaction, and soon milked annually on paper gains you never touched.

And just in case you hit your limit — that moment when you mutter “enough is enough” and start Googling “Monaco residency requirements” buckle up. The French Parliament, in a stroke of Machiavellian genius, just voted to reinstate the original 15-year exit tax as part of the 2025 Finance Bill (passed October 31, now wending through the Senate).

Remember when Macron “liberalized” it in 2018 to just 2-5 years of deferral? Poof — gone. Now, if you’ve been a French tax resident for 6+ of the last 10 years and hold shares or assets worth €800K+, you’ll owe 30% on unrealized gains the day you leave. And to get that deferred (or refunded)? You have to hold everything for 15 long years post-departure without selling, or cough it up.

It’s designed to trap “tax-driven expatriates” — but let’s be real: If you’re a HODLer eyeing Monaco’s 0% CGT beaches after a decade of French fiscal foreplay, this is a velvet-gloved middle finger saying, “Stay and pay, or bleed on the way out.”

But hey, at least there’s Portugal, right? That sunny EU sibling with the 0% long-term crypto gains tax after just 365 days of holding — a quick HODL, cash out tax-free, and sip vinho verde on the Algarve while France fumes. Dreamy.

Except… it’s not. Not for long. Portugal’s golden goose — the NHR program that turbocharged its appeal for crypto retirees — got the axe for new applicants in 2024, a screaming “canary in the coal mine” for what’s coming next. That one-year hold for tax-free bliss? It’s a “subsidy for the rich” that’s already on borrowed time, thanks to the EU’s slow-motion squeeze via MiCA and DAC8.

Brussels is harmonizing taxes across the bloc — think a minimum 15–20% floor on crypto disposals, closing loopholes faster than you can say “grilled sardines overlooking the Atlantic.” Germany’s already floating its own “unproductive capital” taxes, and with France leading the charge in ECOFIN meetings, Portugal’s “blockchain embassy” status is crumbling. 

By 2027? That sweet spot could be a 28% short-term trap or worse, turning your escape pod into just another overpriced surfboard rental. And let’s not even start on the wine — Portugal’s ports are punchy, sure, but they’ll never touch a crisp Sancerre or a brooding Bordeaux. You’re trading fiscal freedom for… third-wave espresso and a tan that fades.

The good news? Your wealth still lives in a seed phrase they can’t seize (yet). Your cost of living is still a charming village and a €17 lunch menu. And your stack still grows faster than their greedy little 1 % mosquito can drink.

## Conclusion

So if you still want to move here, do it with eyes wide open. Raise a glass of Côtes-du-Rhône to the absurdity. Pay the ransom with a smile. And remember:
You’ll be getting screwed harder than almost anyone else in the country…
and you’ll still be freer, richer, and happier than the bureaucrats writing the rules.

Welcome to France.
Santé.
And good luck.
