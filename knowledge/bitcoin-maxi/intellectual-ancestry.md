Imagine a conference in Miami, 2025. The lights dim, the laser eyes glow, and the keynote panel walks onstage: Jesus of Nazareth, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther, and Adam Smith. No security checks needed—none of them own anything the TSA could confiscate except, perhaps, a hardware wallet etched on stone tablets or copper wire.

The audience expects a polite discussion about blockchain scalability. Instead, the venue is immediately struck by righteous lightning, the sound system catches holy fire, and Bitcoin surges past $500,000 before the fire department arrives. Because these five men would not merely understand Bitcoin. They would weaponize it.

> The tragedy of modern Bitcoin discourse is that it has become a tribal shouting match between tech bros, macro tourists, and accelerationist memes. We argue about ETFs and nation-state adoption while forgetting that the protocol is not new. It is ancient. Bitcoin is simply the first successful translation of pre-modern moral intuitions about power, money, and human dignity into unbreakable code.

## Context

Jesus would rank #1 with a violence that embarrasses every influencer currently wearing a lambo avatar. His entire ministry was a prolonged assault on centralized, debt-based, temple-sanctioned money. When he overturned the tables of the money-changers, he wasn’t engaging in performance art; he was attacking the fusion of finance and state power that subsidized Roman occupation while impoverishing Galilean peasants. Fiat is that system perfected. “Not your keys, not your cheese” would be his beatitude for the digital age. He would look at the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet the same way he looked at Caesar’s denarius and say, calmly: “Render unto the printers what is the printers’, but keep the rest in cold storage.”

Tesla, broke and furious in a Colorado Springs laboratory, already understood that energy is the substrate of civilization and that whoever controls its monetary representation controls everything else. Show him proof-of-work and he would weep, not from sentiment, but from recognition. Finally, a money that cannot be confiscated by J.P. Morgan, a money that turns joules directly into sovereignty. He would strap lightning rods to every abandoned tower and run full nodes on stray voltage from the sky.

Jefferson’s hatred of central banking was not academic. He watched the First Bank of the United States become a machine for transferring wealth from farmers to speculators and concluded, correctly, that paper money empires always end in tyranny or collapse. Bitcoin is the constitutional amendment he never got to write: a monetary policy reduced to an unchangeable mathematical constant, enforceable by nothing more coercive than thermodynamics and cryptography.

## Main

Luther, that original shitposter, would stream nightly from Wittenberg, railing against “the Frankfurt School of indulgences known as modern monetary theory.” The 95 theses 2.0 would be a GitHub repository: each thesis a commit, each refutation of fiat a pull request that can never be merged against consensus.

And Adam Smith? He would be quiet at first, taking notes. Then he would publish a slim volume—An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Bitcoin—and the Chicago School would have to rewrite every textbook because the invisible hand finally has a glove that cannot be bought.

> The deeper point is that Bitcoin is not a “technology.” It is the rediscovery of a moral tradition that was nearly extinguished by the 20th century marriage of state and ledger. Every major critic of centralized power in history—from Christ to Tesla—arrived independently at the same conclusion: when the state can create claims on wealth without limit, freedom becomes temporary and truth becomes negotiable.

We spend our days debating whether Michael Saylor or BlackRock “gets it,” when the real validation has already been rendered by men who never lived to see a blockchain yet diagnosed our sickness perfectly. Bitcoin is not asking for their approval. It is their revenge.

So the next time someone tells you Bitcoin is just speculative tulips, or a toy for criminals, or a threat to monetary sovereignty, remember the guest list at that imaginary conference. The greatest enemies of concentrated power in human history would not only would have understood Bitcoin instantly; they would have seen it as the final weapon in the longest war ever fought—the war against those who believe they have the right to redefine reality by printing it.

## Conclusion

The lightning strike in Miami would not be an accident.

It would be a signature.
