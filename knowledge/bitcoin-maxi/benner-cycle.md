It’s 2 a.m. and I’m staring at this half-empty bottle of Bordeaux that cost way more than it should, scrolling through charts on my phone like some degenerate who can’t sleep. You know that feeling? When the market’s been teasing you all year—pumping to 126k back in October, then dumping us down to these mid-90s like it’s personal. And here we are in December 2025, Bitcoin hovering around 90 grand, everyone’s yelling about Fed cuts or whatever, but I’m just sitting here thinking about this dusty old cycle from the 1800s that’s been nagging at me.

This Benner Cycle thing. Some farmer dude in 1875 draws up this chart predicting booms and busts, and crypto bros keep dragging it out every few years like it’s the holy grail. It flagged peaks before ‘29, the dot-com mess, 2008... and now it’s pointing at 2026 as the big “good times” climax before things get ugly into the 2030s. Honestly? I’m not totally sold—cycles break, markets evolve, all that. But damn if it doesn’t line up creepy well with Bitcoin’s halving rhythm. The 2024 halving kicked off this run, and historically peaks hit 12-18 months later. We’re right there now, kinda extended already, but not exploding like past ones.

## Context

Look, every bull feels endless when you’re in it. 

2017 was ICO madness, everyone a genius. 2021? NFTs and DeFi fever, “to the moon” tattoos and all that crap. This time? It’s been... exhausting. Faster gains early on post-halving, then choppy as hell. Valuations stretched—whales dumping while ETFs saw huge inflows earlier in the year but slowed down lately. Sentiment’s all over: retail chasing $200k calls, but on-chain shows long-term holders taking profits. 

Global liquidity? Fed’s done easing for now, everything’s priced in. It’s that classic top vibe, where nothing’s screaming crash yet, but everything feels tired.

## Main

I swear, this reminds me of that one time back in 2013—I was still grinding as a journalist then, moonlighting on crypto forums because the day job paid shit. Bought a chunk at like $690, felt like a visionary. Then 2014 hit, price cratered to $210, and I panic-sold half at the bottom because rent was due and I was convinced it was dead. Dumbest move ever. Held the rest through the pain, but man, that regret stuck. Self-deprecating as hell now, but it taught me: blind holding works until it doesn’t. You gotta have a plan when the music slows.

So here’s what I’m doing—call it my jaded two-phase thing. Nothing fancy, no “wealth multiplication” buzzword bullshit.

Phase one: trimming on the way up, if we get it. We’re already seeing rallies fizzle around 94-100k lately. If it pushes higher into early 2026, I’m slowly rotating out—aiming for 20-30% in cash or stables by mid-year. Sell into strength while buyers are still frothy. Build some dry powder that actually earns a bit, not just sitting there bleeding.

Phase two: wait for the real pain, whenever it comes—maybe late ‘26 or ‘27 if Benner or halving history rhymes. Deploy in chunks at the lows, the kind that make your stomach turn. Sub-50k? Hell yes, if we get there like past bears.

Could rotate a bit into gold if fiat keeps debasing, or solid alts that aren’t pure hype. But mostly? Liquidity. 

Cash is king when everyone’s leveraged and capitulating.

Kind of wild, right? This isn’t doom—it’s just setup. The folks who sold near ‘17 and ‘21 tops, bought the ‘18 and ‘22 blood? They crushed it. Wealth transfers in bears, from weak hands to patient ones. If 2026 is the peak, great. If it extends longer—supercycle dreams—your trimmed stack still rides, cash yields quietly. If crash never comes? Rotate back in easy. Protects you either way.

## Conclusion

I’m not saying sell everything tomorrow, don’t @ me. Could be wrong—markets love humiliating us vets. But with the cycle whispering 2026, exhaustion everywhere... yeah, preparing feels smart.

Next time Bitcoin pumps hard and you’re tempted to go all-in again, try this dumb thing: sell just 10% into it, park it in stables. See how it feels not being fully exposed when it inevitably dips. Tell me in a year if it saved your ass—or if I’m just an old cynic rambling over wine.
