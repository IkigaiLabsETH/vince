We’ve been the village idiots since 1999. We tried to stream video when the internet sounded like a dying fax machine. VCs laughed us out of the room. We opened a kitesurf school when every government on the Mediterranean was trying to ban the sport for being “too dangerous.” We bought Bitcoin at $92 because some pseudonymous nerd posted a nine-page PDF that read like a suicide note to central banking. Every single time we were right, and every single time the smart money called us delusional.

So when we say the next ten years are going to make 2022 look like a gentle massage, understand we’re not asking for permission to be right again. This is NOT the last piece in our quantum trilogy, but we’re done being polite. The polite fiction says quantum is a 2040 problem, Bitcoin will softly fork its way out, and everything will be fine if we all just hold hands and migrate in an orderly fashion. Fuck that. The real question isn’t “can Bitcoin survive quantum?”
The real question is “who the fuck is going to swing the hammer first and why are you pretending it won’t be on purpose?”

## Context

Suspect Zero: Your Own Government\*\*
\*\*
Your favorite democracy already owns more seized Bitcoin than MicroStrategy. They have off-books investments in every serious quantum company you’ve never heard of. They have continuity-of-government bunkers full of GPUs that make your mining rig look like a Tamagotchi. When they crack it, they won’t announce it. They’ll move 50,000 BTC from a 2009 Patoshi address at 3 a.m. on a Tuesday, blame “Chinese hackers,” and then pass a law saying all abandoned private keys now belong to the Department of Homeland Security for “national security reasons.” You will cheer because the bad guys got owned. Then you’ll realize the bad guys were always you.

Suspect One: Google\*\*
\*\*
Google already knows what you’re going to google before you do. They have an entire campus dedicated to making sure you never own anything ever again. A quantum breakthrough is just the final boss level of that mission. One quiet weekend in Mountain View, some PhD runs Shor on secp256k1 to “test error correction.” Keys fall out like Skittles. Monday morning they launch Google Wallet Quantum Edition™ and announce that for your safety all pre-2028 Bitcoin must now be custodied by them. You will download the app because the price is down 90 % and you’re tired.

Suspect Two: That One Kid\*\*
\*\*
There is a 19-year-old at Caltech right now who hasn’t seen sunlight since the FTX collapse. He’s got root access to a lab with 317 qubits and a Red Bull tab measured in liters. He’s doing it for the lulz and the GitHub stars. One night he cracks a toy curve, posts the private key to block 9 on Twitter, and goes to bed. He wakes up to the entire market cap of Bitcoin being worth less than his student loan debt. He will become the most famous person alive for exactly 48 hours. Then he will disappear into witness protection or a yacht, depending on who gets to him first.

## Main

The Dirty Secret Nobody Says Out Loud

Nobody needs to steal all the coins to win. They just need to steal enough to trigger the mother of all leverage cascades. One single 100,000 BTC transaction from a 2009 address and the entire perpetual futures market liquidates in both directions at once. The price doesn’t “correct.” It discovers gravity is optional.

And Here’s the Edgiest Part\*\*

Most of you reading this will do nothing. You’ll retweet the thread, nod sagely, then keep reusing the same receive address like it’s 2017. You will deserve exactly what happens next.

**What Winners Do Instead**

Winners stopped reusing addresses in 2024. Winners are already running the BIP-360 testnets. Winners are stacking coins that will never be exposed because they were born after Taproot. Winners don’t wait for consensus.

**Final Transmission**

We’ve been the contrarian since dial-up.
We were right when they laughed.
We were right when they banned.
We were right when they called $92 magic beans.

They’re laughing again.

Let them.

## Conclusion

See you on the other side of the apocalypse, legends.

Try to keep up.
