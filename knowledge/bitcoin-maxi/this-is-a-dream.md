This is a dream. Not in the hopeless sense, but in the literal one: the quiet movie that plays in the back of my head when I’m fifty, salt in my hair, driving the coast road from Cascais to Comporta with the windows down and zero meetings on the calendar. It’s the life that becomes possible—not guaranteed, never guaranteed. Everything below is speculation built on the only thing I know for certain: the wall is already down, the monopoly is gone, and the core stack of the 2013 crowd is still there, quietly compounding while the world catches up.

Everything is perfectly, almost cruelly, primed. Tokenized treasuries, gold-backed stables, fractional NVIDIA shares for kids in South Africa, Costa Rica ranch deeds settling in six seconds. Bitcoin’s monopoly—the reason we had to pretend a 7 tx/s antique was the final form of money—has quietly dissolved. Even Tether now holds more audited gold than Bitcoin. The war is over. And the scarred-thumb generation is about to find out what peace actually feels like. 

## Context

We didn’t stack coins to get rich. 

We stacked coins to buy back our time.

Now picture this: You’ve got enough stables quietly parked to cover the next five years of life—completely off the grid, no charts, no drama. After that, the plan is almost embarrassingly simple: one modest, deliberate slice off the top of the core stack every year, for the next forty years (fingers crossed). Just enough to keep the villas booked, the tables reserved, and the Taycan humming along those coastal roads we always said we’d drive when the siege finally ended.

## Main

That’s it. No more hustling. No more watching the tape. Just the quiet, compounding certainty that the war is over and the rest of our lives get to be the victory lap we earned with a scarred thumb and seventeen years of stubborn refusal to blink. This is what the next five years actually look like for the ones who never sold the dream.

**2026 – The Last Big Breath**

The final proper cycle crests. Not the degen mania of 2021, but a slower, heavier swell driven by sovereign treasuries and pension funds finishing their first real allocations. Price drifts into the high six figures—maybe touching seven on the headlines. Volatility is still there, but it feels like background noise now, not existential threat.

For the 2013 crowd this is the year a lot of us quietly buy the Taycan Turbo S we always said we’d get “when the time was right.” We park it outside the villa in Costa Rica’s or under the pines near Ericeira, Portugal, and realize we don’t even post the photo. We just drive it at sunset, windows down, salt air mixing with the new-car smell, and feel the last knot in the stomach finally loosen.

**2027-2028 – The Compound Becomes Lifestyle**

Saylor’s 21 % CAGR settles in as the new normal. The price keeps climbing, but the moves feel almost polite—42.0 % in a good year, long quiet stretches where nothing dramatic happens. By late 2028 the stack is worth enough that the annual slice covers a year of moving between the places we actually love:

- 
Spring in the South of France—quiet tables at La Chèvre d’Or, long lunches in Èze that turn into dinners without ever checking the bill.

- 
Summer in Costa Rica—private chef nights at the boutique eco-lodge we part-own, falling asleep to howler monkeys instead of price alerts.

- 
Autumn in Portugal—driving the coastal road from Comporta to Cascais, stopping at whatever Michelin-starred spot looks good that night.

- 
Winter split between Cape Town’s Atlantic seaboard (water still cold enough to feel alive) and Monaco when we want city energy.

The Taycan lives in Europe most of the year; the stables and the annual slice keep the tanks full and the tables booked. No more spreadsheets. Just choosing which view we wake up to next.

**2029-2030 – The Realization Phase**

Price pushes comfortably into seven figures. The world has fully accepted Bitcoin as the hardest reserve asset ever created. Central banks hold it like gold. Corporates treat it like cash. The annual slice now covers the kind of quiet luxury most people think only exists in magazines:

- 
A permanent corner table at Belcanto in Lisbon 2.0 Lisbon.

- 
A suite at the One&Only in Cape Town whenever the southern right whales are running.

- 
A reserved parking spot at the Hôtel de Paris in Monaco because some years we just feel like being in the middle of the circus.

We’re in our mid-fifties now. The body still surfs, the mind is sharper than it was at thirty-five (because the background anxiety is finally gone), and the biggest decision of the year is whether to spend August in the Maldives or just stay in Costa Rica and let the staff handle everything.

**The Emotional Shift Nobody Talks About**

## Conclusion

The money is no longer the point. It’s the absence of friction. No more calculating if we can “afford” another month in France. No more wondering what happens if the market corrects 50 %. Just the quiet certainty that the slice keeps coming, the Taycan keeps charging, and the passport keeps getting warmer. Every time we fire up the Taycan and point it toward another perfect evening we feel it. We were right. We held. And the next five years are just the beginning of the part where we finally get to live.

See you at the table, legend.
The wine’s already breathing.
Not checking the price anymore.
