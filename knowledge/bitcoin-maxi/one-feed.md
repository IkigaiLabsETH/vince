The internet in 2025 is one giant stadium with a single jumbotron. Eight billion people stare up at the same screen. Yesterday it flashed Sydney Sweeney’s chest. Today she is already forgotten. Tomorrow someone else will be sacrificed. Second place does not get half the views. Second place gets zero. There is no For You page anymore. There is only the One Feed, and we all scream the same four-brain-cell chant in perfect unison while we hit refresh and wait for the next human sacrifice.

This is not culture. This is coordination at planetary scale. And it is the single best trading edge left in public markets.

## Context

Attention has collapsed into a winner-take-all monoculture. When something crosses the invisible threshold where every timeline, every group chat, every dinner table is forced to have an opinion, the next 24 to 72 hours of price action become almost perfectly deterministic. The rip is not probabilistic. It is reflexive. People buy not because they believe the story, but because they cannot afford to look stupid for missing the only thing anyone is allowed to talk about.

2025’s tape reads like a highlight reel of this exact mechanic.

DeepSeek drops a benchmark on a random Tuesday night. By sunrise it is the only topic on Hacker News, Weibo, and Crypto Twitter at the same time. Chinese AI proxies that traded 2 million dollars of volume the day before do 200 million the next day. Free money.

## Main

Michael Saylor posts a chart with a green dot on Sunday. By Monday morning every Bitcoin maximalist has turned their profile picture into that dot. BTC opens up 5%, MSTR gaps 12%, anyone who sold Monday puts into the close prints for the week.

The pattern never changes. One narrative. One feed. One reflexive bid. Half-life rarely longer than three days.

This is not retail speculation. This is the entire market being dragged by the collar into a single spotlight because global attention now behaves like a phase transition. Below the threshold, nothing happens. Above it, everything happens at once. There is no middle.

Traditional volatility models still price these episodes like normal news events. They are not normal. They are phase changes. Implied vol underreacts by 30 to 100 points every single time, handing out free straddles to anyone paying attention.

The playbook is brutally simple:

- 
Live in the feeders (Crypto Twitter, TG forwards, certain Discords).

- 
Watch for the moment discourse loses all degrees of freedom. When every thread is a variation of the same sentence, you are inside the singularity.

- 
Buy the reflex, not the thesis. Size it like momentum, not value. One to three day hold.

- 
Sell when the conversation flips from “this is the future” to “ok everyone is in, who’s left?” CNBC discovery is usually the exit liquidity bell.

Most of these narratives are objectively idiotic. That is the point. Truth content is irrelevant. Resonance frequency is everything. The market is no longer pricing cash flows. It is pricing how many human brains are vibrating in unison at the exact same moment.

The edge will not last forever. 

Eventually options pricing will catch up, sentiment scrapers will become table stakes, and the jumbotron will fracture again. But right now, in late 2025, the asymmetry is still grotesque.

We are all serfs in the coliseum. 

The lions are memes. 

The emperor is attention itself. 

Enjoy the show. 

And keep bidding whatever the One Feed tells you to bid, because for a brief, glorious window, second place really is death, and first place prints money.

**Outro: The Bitterroot Opt-Out Clause**

I cashed my ZEC bag at 6.9× and wired the money straight into OG BTC. I’m done chasing the jumbotron. Done waking up to find the One Feed has chosen a new god and executed the old one before breakfast. There will always be another DeepSeek, another green dot, another cat coin that makes rational people speak in tongues for seventy-two hours and then forget the name forever.

## Conclusion

Let the coliseum burn its clowns. I took my winnings, turned them into altitude and silence, and walked out while the crowd was still screaming for the next sacrifice. The world will keep refreshing. 

The lions will keep eating.
