It was never about protecting clients from risk. It was about protecting the franchise. Over the past six months, Wall Street has executed one of the most brazen, coordinated assaults on a public company most of us have ever witnessed. The target? MicroStrategy (MSTR), the original Bitcoin Treasury pioneer. The weapon? A lethal cocktail of margin hikes, frozen share transfers, failure-to-deliver spikes, perfectly-timed research notes, and a little-known index provider called MSCI that still carries Morgan Stanley DNA.

The goal is simple: kill the premium at which MSTR trades to its Bitcoin holdings, force a mass exodus of capital, and redirect hundreds of billions of dollars of future Bitcoin leverage into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the structured notes that JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are now frantically rolling out.

## Context

They are not hiding in plain sight.

**The Timeline Reads Like a Hit Job**

Here’s the whole saga as one juicy, drama-packed paragraph: 

## Main

*In May, Jim Chanos—the grim reaper of dead malls—shocked everyone by announcing he was long Bitcoin but short MicroStrategy like his life depended on it. Two months later, JPMorgan quietly jacked MSTR margin requirements from 50 % to a soul-crushing 95 %, triggering a cascade of forced liquidations and tears. While the bodies were still warm, the same JPMorgan launched 1.5× leveraged notes on BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF in August, because nothing says “we care about risk” like handing retail even more leverage. September saw Japan’s MicroStrategy clone, Metaplanet, try to raise cash for more BTC, only for MSCI to slam the gates shut and refuse to let the new shares into its indexes. Then, on October 10—sixteen minutes before Trump’s tariff announcement flash-crashed the world—MSCI dropped the most perfectly timed consultation paper in history asking whether all “Digital Asset Treasury” companies should just be booted from global equity indexes forever. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan spent the next month racing to file increasingly ridiculous IBIT-linked structured notes, and on November 20 JPMorgan pulled the most diabolical twofer imaginable: they finally let clients buy their shiny new leveraged IBIT product… while simultaneously dusting off that six-week-old MSCI paper to scream “DEL exonerATING RISK!!!” about MicroStrategy in a research note. Same bank, same day—happily selling you leveraged Bitcoin with one hand and lighting MicroStrategy on fire with the other. *

Wall Street never changes, it just discovered crypto.

If this were a John Grisham novel, the editor would tell the author to tone down the coincidences.

**The Prize Is Enormous**

MicroStrategy currently holds 478,740 BTC. At today’s price, that’s roughly $46 billion of Bitcoin against a $59 billion market cap. The 1.23× premium is the lowest it has traded since the 2024 halving. If that premium goes to 1.0×, roughly $11 billion of market value evaporates overnight. If MSCI boots MSTR from the World Index in February 2026, passive outflows alone could exceed $8 billion.

That is $8–11 billion of forced selling that has to go somewhere.

Guess where JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley would like it to go?

Into the IBIT-linked products they spent the summer designing.

These are not charitable offerings. They are 1.5× to 2× leveraged Bitcoin exposure with downside buffers, quarterly call features, and fat fees baked in. In other words, the exact same leveraged Bitcoin product MicroStrategy was giving the market for free, except now the banks get the spread and the custody.

**The Dog That Hasn’t Barked**

If this were truly about “risk management,” you would expect to see similar treatment for every leveraged Bitcoin proxy. Yet miners like MARA and RIOT, which also trade at premiums to their Bitcoin holdings and have far worse balance sheets, have not seen the same margin hikes or frozen transfers. The campaign is surgical.

And the short interest? Still under 10 % of the float. The real attack is not coming through disclosed borrows. It is coming through derivatives, prime-brokerage choke points, and the slow strangulation of liquidity.

**The Bigger War**

This is not just about one company. This is the opening battle in the war over who gets to be the leverage layer on top of Bitcoin.

Michael Saylor proved that a public company could issue equity and convertible debt at a premium to NAV, buy Bitcoin, and create a permanent 1.5–3× leveraged Bitcoin vehicle with no K-1, no management fee, and no termination date, and no counterparty risk beyond the U.S. legal system. That blueprint is now being copied by public companies in Japan, Canada, Australia, and soon sovereign nations.

Wall Street cannot allow that blueprint to survive. If every S&P 500 company with a strong balance sheet starts allocating 5–10 % to Bitcoin and issuing at 1.5× NAV, the spot Bitcoin ETFs become the low-margin utility layer and the corporate treasuries become the high-margin leverage layer. Trillions of dollars of fee revenue never make it to Park Avenue.

So they are burning the village to save it.

**The Irony**

JPMorgan’s own analysts now call Bitcoin a “macro asset” with a 12-month target of $170,000. The same bank that once called Bitcoin “fraud” now accepts IBIT as loan collateral and is racing to sell leveraged exposure to its clients. They have seen the light. They just want to be the ones selling the bulbs.

**What Happens Next**

January 15, 2026 is the new D-Day. That is when MSCI will announce whether it implements the Digital Asset Treasury exclusion. If it does, the forced selling will be biblical. If it does not, the shorts will be carried out in a box.

Either way, the Bitcoin Treasury model does not die. It mutates. Saylor has already shown the next iteration: $2.1 billion of 0 % convertible prefs with a 10 % PIK dividend payable in stock or Bitcoin at the company’s option. Financing cost drops to 0.7 % by year ten. Game theory says every CFO on earth is taking notes.

Final Thought

The banks spent a decade laughing at Bitcoin.
Then they spent two years trying to ban it.
Now they are trying to tax it, custody it, and rehypothecate it.

But they still can’t stop a determined public company from issuing equity at a premium and stacking sats forever.

Short the bankers.
Long the protocol.

And if you really want to send a message, move your shares out of JPMorgan custody while you still can.

The revolution will not be custodied.

UPDATE: 

Five days after JPMorgan’s research team screamed “MSTR = DELISTING RISK!!!” (citing the pending MSCI exclusion that could trigger $8–11B in forced selling), the same bank filed with the SEC for new structured notes on BlackRock’s IBIT:

- 
1.5× uncapped upside on Bitcoin through 2028

- 
30% downside buffer

- 
Early call in Dec 2026 with a guaranteed 16% payout

- 
Fat fees and custody, of course

## Conclusion

Same bank. Same week.
One hand torches MicroStrategy’s premium.
The other hand sells you the exact same leveraged Bitcoin exposure — except now JPMorgan gets the spread and BlackRock gets the flows.

They aren’t even pretending anymore.
