## Act I – The Coronation

October 6, 2025. The price touched $126,272 at 03:14 UTC and the entire timeline lit up like a cathedral at Easter. Screenshots of seven-figure portfolios. Champagne emojis. Grown men posting voice notes of themselves crying in Lamborghinis. We had waited four years for this moment—the post-halving parabolic blow-off that every cycle promised and only one ever truly delivered.

This time the institutions were here. The ETFs had $62 billion locked. Trump was back in the White House signing executive orders with a gold Sharpie. We told ourselves the movie had changed. We were wrong. We had only changed the theater.

## Act II – The First Whisper

It began the way all horror stories begin: with something too small to notice. On October 20, the 50-week moving average kissed the 200-week from above and then, like a lover who has already decided to leave, slipped beneath it.
A Death Cross. The same pattern that called the top in 2018. The same pattern that called the top in 2021. Technicals are not prophecy; they are memory wearing the mask of prophecy. And memory, in crypto, is a loaded gun pointed at the future. For three days nothing happened. The price crabbed sideways at $119,000 while analysts wrote 40-tweet threads explaining why “this time the cross doesn’t matter.” They cited BlackRock’s custody numbers. They cited Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. They cited hash rate. They were all correct.
And they were all doomed.

Act III – The Unraveling**

The first real crack appeared on a Sunday night in Asia, the hour when liquidity is thinnest and fear is fattest. Someone—maybe a miner in Kazakhstan, maybe a leveraged fund in Singapore—hit the sell button hard enough to take out the $110,000 bid stack. The cascade was instant. $1.2 billion in longs liquidated in eight minutes. Twitter became a crime scene photo: red candles, broken-heart reacts, screenshots of accounts down 80 %. By the time the New York open arrived, the price was $97,000 and falling like a body off a roof.

That week the narratives arrived in waves, each more convincing than the last.

- 
First came the technicians: “We told you the Death Cross was real.”

- 
Then came the macro tourists: “10-year yields are at 4.6 %, the Fed just killed risk-on.”

- 
Then the conspiracists: “China dumped their 194,000 BTC from the PlusToken seizure.”

- 
Then the philosophers: “This was the IPO. The old whales finally had an exit ramp and they took it.”

They were all half-right, which is the most dangerous kind of right. The truth was uglier and more human. The Death Cross had simply reminded ten thousand large holders—some of them legends who had not sold a single satoshi since 2016—that they were mortal. That their unrealized gains could, in fact, realize themselves into something smaller. And once the first legend sold, the second legend saw the first legend sell, and the third legend saw the second…**It was never about China. It was about mirrors.

Act IV – The Church Beneath the Rubble

November 21. $87,400. The price is down 34 % from the top. The comment sections are cathedrals of despair. People who were posting “$200k by Christmas” six weeks ago now post suicide-hotline numbers. The faithful have gone quiet; only the bitter remain loud. And yet. Walk the blockchain at block height 873,991 and you will see something the price will never tell you. Daily transactions are 15 % higher than last year. Lightning capacity is up 42 %. The hash rate did not flinch; it kept grinding upward. The ETFs bled for twelve days and then, on the thirteenth day, began buying again. BlackRock filed to increase their authorized participant list. Coinbase added 1.8 million verified users while the price was bleeding. The network did not notice there was a bear market. The network has never noticed a bear market. It only knows work and time.

Epilogue – The Gospel According to the Long Bleeding**

Every cycle has its Long Bleeding, the moment when the market remembers it is not a machine but a story told by apes with leverage. 2013 had Mt. Gox. 2017 had the futures launch. 2021 had China banning mining for the seventeenth time. 2025 has the Death Cross and the ghost of every whale who ever swore “not your keys, not your cheese” while quietly wiring coins to an exchange at 3 a.m. These are not the end. They are the tollbooth. The toll is always the same: You must look into the abyss and decide whether you believe the network is still telling the truth when the price is screaming that it lied. I have paid the toll four times now. Each time I thought I would finally learn to leave before the bleeding started. Each time I discovered that leaving early is just another way of saying you never understood why you arrived. So I will sit here at $87,000 the way I once sat at $3,200 and $16,000 and $19,000, watching the same ritual unfold:**the mocking, the eulogies, the triumphant “I told you so” from people who have never been right about anything except the timing of their own cowardice. And when the price eventually climbs out of this grave—as it always does, because scarcity is patient and attention is fickle—I will not say “I told you so.” I will only whisper to the new believers the one sentence the old believers taught me in the dark: The chain never lies. The price only forgets.

See you on the other side of this one, friends. Bring your scars. 

Epilogue II – The Short Winter**

Do not brace for the old winter. There will be no 400-day night this time. The chain already knows. While the price was carving its bloody 34 % requiem down to $87,000, the network kept building: hashrate +9 % since the top, Lightning channels +41 %, daily settled volume quietly higher than any point in 2024.**The miners did not capitulate; they upgraded. The institutions did not flee; they accumulated through the entire bleed (BlackRock alone scooped another 9,200 BTC in the $80 ks). Long-term holder supply is now at all-time highs again, because the ones who sold in October have finished selling. History has been rewritten in real time. Every prior cycle needed a full year of despair to shake out the tourists. This cycle has ETFs, sovereign bids, and a U.S. administration that just made Bitcoin strategic reserve asset #1. The Fed is done tightening by Christmas. The halving was only nineteen months ago. The winter will be short and surgical: $78–$84 k sometime in January or February, one final flush of the remaining leverage, one last chorus of “cycle over” from people who have been wrong about every cycle. Then the bids return. Not retail FOMO. Cold, quiet, institutional bids that do not tweet. By March 2026 the 50-week will cross back above the 200-week (the Golden Cross nobody will notice because they’ll be too busy staring at $180,000). By summer we will look down from altitudes most of us cannot yet pronounce without laughing. 

This is not hope. This is arithmetic wearing the mask of mercy. So keep the scars. They will only hurt for a few more weeks. Then they become stories you tell at $250,000 about the winter that forgot to last.

Why We Still Keep ~20 % in USDC Even If $80k Feels Like Rock Bottom**

Look, we’re as bullish as anyone. We think the real bear winter is going to be measured in weeks, not quarters. We think $80–84k is probably the zone where the last weak hands puke and the Golden Cross quietly flips in March. We think the next leg is $180k+ by summer ’26 and the xx-BTC core stack never gets touched. We keep about 20 % in USDC because we still want to eat out and live the good life. We want instant ammo in case we get one last stupid flush to $72–78k and can grab a few more coins without hesitation. We’re actively doing 4–5 Echo seed deals a month and throwing six figures into early MegaETH pools—one moonshot will pay for all the rugs. Most importantly, that cash buffer means red candles don’t ruin sleep or force bad decisions. It’s not fear, it’s just grown-up money management while staying ready to pounce. So yeah, we’re 80 % convinced this is the shakeout, not the apocalypse. But the 20 % cash isn’t fear; it’s just adulting. It lets us stay greedy when others are fearful without ever having to be fearful ourselves. When the final low prints (whenever that is), that 20 % will either buy coins or fund the next winners. Either outcome is fine. The core BTC stays sacred. That’s it. Nothing poetic, just the actual playbook we run.
