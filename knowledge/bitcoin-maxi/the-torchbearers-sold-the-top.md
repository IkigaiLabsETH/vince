The OGs just cashed their life-changing bags, bought vineyards and lake houses, and quietly walked off into the sunset while the rest of us are still here yelling about tariffs like it matters. They didn’t rage-quit. They didn’t get rekt. They didn’t even post a goodbye thread. They just… left.

Owen Gunden sent his last 11,000 BTC to Coinbase at 3:17 a.m., kept 13 coins for the memes, and bought a Pinot vineyard in Oregon before the confirmations were even warm.

## Context

Marek, the Czech miner who used to preach “banks are going to die” over absinthe in Prague 2017, moved 4,187 BTC last month, kept exactly thirteen (one per halving he survived), and bought a house on Lake Zurich so clean it looks AI-generated.

These are not capitulation stories.
These are graduation stories.

The revolution won so hard the revolutionaries got bored.

## Main

They got spot ETFs, Senate hearings, MicroStrategy borrowing billions to stack, a President promising a national reserve while threatening to tariff the planet into oblivion. They got everything they ever asked for on a silver platter with KYC attached.

And in that moment of total victory they looked around, shrugged, and said: “Cool… but I think I’m gonna go plant some roses and teach my kid how to kitesurf instead.” So they sold. Calmly. Methodically. At prices most of us still call “life-changing money” while doom-scrolling at 3 a.m.

And the chain recorded it all in perfect, merciless detail:

- 
815 k old coins to exchanges in 30 days

- 
LTH supply down hardest since the 2022 nuclear winter

- 
Average coin age of sellers this cycle: 4.7 years

- 
LTH realized price just flipped above spot

Meanwhile miners are stacking, institutions are only trimming, and the only people actually capitulating are the 2024 ETF tourists who showed up late to the cookout.

Translation: the marginal seller right now is the exact person who used to reply “lmao enjoy your fiat” to anyone who dared mention taking profits. They stopped believing the story. Not Bitcoin. The story. The one about living on seasteads, paying for coffee with lightning, watching central banks burn while we sip mai tais on the beach. That story died quietly somewhere between the BlackRock prospectus and the IRS getting real-time 1099s from Coinbase. And honestly?
Good for them. They earned the right to log off. They carried this torch through four separate 85 % drawdowns, Mt. Gox, China bans, Silk Road seizures, 2018 suicide hotlines, Terra, FTX, and still never sold a single sat. If anyone gets to buy the vineyard and disappear, it’s them. 

But here’s the punchline nobody wants to say out loud: They just handed the greatest gift in financial history to the next wave at an 80 % discount. Those coins didn’t vanish. They’re sitting in colder wallets now, sure. But they’re still here. Waiting for the kid who hasn’t opened their first wallet yet. The one who’s 16, angry, brilliant, and about to stumble across nine pages of pure mathematics that can’t be shut down, seized, or inflated. That kid is going to feel the same electric jolt we all felt the first time.

The same “holy fuck the future is negotiable” moment. Except this time the coins are cheap. And the story is fresh again. The OGs didn’t kill the dream. They retired from it. Paid off the mortgage, kissed the kids goodnight, and left the door wide open with the porch light on. All we gotta do is walk through. 

So yeah, let it hurt for five minutes. Grieve the version of the future that died this year. Then dry your eyes, open the bid screen, and start stacking like the snubbed unc you are. Because the torchbearers just put the fire on clearance. And the next shift is about to go full degen. 

## Conclusion

Life’s 2 short 2 drink bad wine and it’s definitely 2 short to stay poor when the greatest wealth transfer in history is happening in plain sight. See you on the other side of whatever this becomes with sand between my toes and a fat stack I’ll never sell. aloha & ₿ like ikigAI unc lowkey stacking while the roses bloom
