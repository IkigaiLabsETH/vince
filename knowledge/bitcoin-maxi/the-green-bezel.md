## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Value Retention and Appreciation**: Understanding how certain physical assets (like luxury watches) can maintain or appreciate in value over time, similar to digital assets like Bitcoin.
- **Liquidity vs. Illiquidity**: Recognizing the trade-offs between cash availability and asset retention in times of market pressure.
- **Repurchase Options**: Incorporating flexible agreements in transactions that allow for future repurchase under defined terms, providing a safety net for emotional decision-making.

**Analytical Approach:**
- **Long-term Vision**: Cultivate a perspective that transcends immediate market fluctuations; assess potential future value based on historical performance and fundamentals.
- **Emotional Detachment**: Learn to separate emotional ties from financial decisions; consider the intrinsic and extrinsic value of an asset without personal sentiment clouding judgment.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risk of holding versus liquidating assets, especially during downturns, and ensure that decisions align with broader investment goals.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Market Cycles**: Identify historical patterns of boom and bust within asset classes (cryptocurrencies and luxury watches) to foresee potential future movements.
- **Behavioral Trends**: Monitor collective market sentiment (fear/capitulation vs. greed) to inform timing decisions on buying or selling.
- **Cross-Asset Correlations**: Look for relationships between different asset classes, noting how external factors (like economic conditions or regulatory changes) can impact both crypto and physical assets.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Diversification Strategy**: Implement a balanced portfolio that includes both tangible and intangible assets, assessing their performance relative to market cycles and personal financial goals.
- **Exit and Entry Strategies**: Develop clear buy and sell criteria, including emotional triggers and market signals, to maintain discipline during volatile periods.
- **Leverage Relationships**: Utilize personal and professional networks for strategic asset transactions, ensuring flexibility in agreements that allow for future repurchase options when necessary.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on the methodologies that guide investment decisions rather than specific historical data points.
- Extract actionable insights applicable to current market conditions, fostering a mindset of strategic and informed decision-making.
- Maintain brevity, ensuring clarity in how to approach investment scenarios through the lens of the discussed frameworks.

I still remember the exact moment I let it go.

December 2018. Crypto winter had frozen everything. Bitcoin was bleeding out, scraping $3,214 on December 15th—the lowest point of the cycle. 

## Context

The air smelled like capitulation. Everyone I knew was selling, cursing, or pretending they’d never touched it.

I wasn’t selling. I was buying.

But I needed cash. Fast.
**
On my wrist sat my constant companion of fifteen years: the Rolex Submariner 16610LV—“Kermit.” The 50th anniversary edition with the green aluminum bezel. Bought in SA back in 2004 for roughly €3,000 when the rand was weak and the AD was generous. It had lived through everything with me.

## Main

The Golden Era**

We’d moved to J-Bay, the right-hand point break that surfers dream about. Supertubes rolling in perfect, mechanical lines. Every dawn patrol, every big winter swell, every lazy summer glass-off—Kermit was there. Salt crusted the case. Sun gently faded the green bezel to a softer, lived-in hue. The Maxi dial glowed in the dark lineup like a private lighthouse.

I wore it daily. Surfing. Braais on the beach. Nights in town. 

It wasn’t jewelry. It was part of the rhythm.

Back then, in 2018, good Kermits traded around $15,000 on the secondary market. Not crazy money, but respectable for a neo-vintage steel sports Rolex.

The Deal**

I went to one of my closest friends—someone who’d shared hundreds of sessions, countless beers, endless stories. “I need $12,000 cash. Now. For Bitcoin.”

He knew the watch. Loved it, actually.

I sold it to him for exactly $12,000—below market, a brother’s discount.

But I knew I’d regret it. Deep down, I already did.

So we added a clause: I could buy it back anytime, at cost plus 10% compounded annually. A gentleman’s repurchase option. He took the watch. I took the cash. We swapped the dollars for exactly 3.3 BTC—right at the absolute bottom, when the world was convinced crypto was dead forever.

I begged him: “Please, man. Buy even a little. You’ll thank me later.”

He laughed it off.

That was the last time I ever pushed him on Bitcoin.

**The Divergence**

Bitcoin didn’t stay dead.

It crawled to $10k in 2019. Exploded through 2020–2021. Crashed again in 2022. Then, with ETFs, institutional flows, and halving dynamics, it roared into 2025. Today, December 20, 2025, Bitcoin trades around $88,000. That $12,000 turned into roughly $290,000. A 24x return in seven years. Not bad for a panic buy. Meanwhile, the “Kermit” didn’t sit still either. From 2015 ($8,000–$10,000) to the 2022 peak ($30,000–$40,000 for nice examples), it more than tripled.

Then the luxury watch correction hit. Prices cooled.

Today, solid pre-owned Kermits trade in the $20,000–$25,000 range. Early “Flat 4” variants higher. A respectable ~8–10% compounded annual return since 2018. Solid for a physical asset. Blue-chip, even. But nowhere near Bitcoin.

The Arithmetic of Regret

Let’s run the numbers coldly.

If I’d kept the watch: $12,000 → ~$22,500 today. Roughly 9% CAGR.Safe. 

Tangible. Beautiful.

Instead: $12,000 → 3.3 BTC → ~$290,000 today. Roughly 62% CAGR.

The gap is brutal. But the real regret wasn’t financial.

**The Buy-Back**

A couple years in, as both assets climbed, I asked to exercise the option. “10% per year, right?” He hesitated. Then: “Nah. Only if you pay 100% premium.” Double. The gentleman’s agreement dissolved. Conversations shortened. Sessions stopped. A friendship that had survived decades of waves quietly eroded.

Over a watch.

Over money.

**The Deeper Lesson**

Luxury watches like the Kermit are wonderful assets.

Limited supply. Strong brand. Emotional resonance. Historical appreciation that often beats inflation, sometimes stocks.

They’re portable. Wearable. Joyful.

But they are not asymmetric.

Bitcoin—at its core—is the most asymmetric asset most of us will ever touch.

Finite supply. Global, borderless. Network effects compounding relentlessly.

When the world zigged in 2018, convinced it was over, the contrarian zag paid off in ways no steel sports Rolex ever could.

Yet here’s the skepticism I owe you: We’re now at $88,000.

Valuations are no longer absurdly cheap.
**
Institutional adoption is real—ETFs hold billions—but it also means Bitcoin increasingly moves with risk assets. Correlation with Nasdaq is climbing. The easy 100x from the bottom is gone. Future returns will likely be strong, but tamer. Maybe 15–30% CAGR over the next decade if adoption continues.Still excellent. Still better than most assets. 

But not the once-in-a-lifetime free lunch of 2018.

The Real Cost**

I don’t regret the trade.

Financially, it was the best decision I ever made.

I regret the friendship.

I regret how money—when it multiplies fast—can reveal character in uncomfortable ways. I regret not foreseeing that a “gentleman’s deal” has no force when one side sees the other getting rich.

Objects are just objects.

The green bezel was beautiful.

The waves at Supertubes were perfect.

But trust—once broken—is harder to repair than any faded aluminum insert. If you’re reading this in late 2025, wondering whether to rotate out of watches into Bitcoin, or vice versa: Do the math. Understand the asymmetry left in each.

## Conclusion

But more importantly: Know who you’re dealing with.

Because in the end, the biggest risk isn’t price. It’s people. The watch is gone. The coins are here. The friend isn’t. And some lessons you only learn once.
