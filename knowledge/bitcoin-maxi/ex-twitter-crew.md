---2007. Those were the days when a solid post could spread organically, no algo games required. I built real audiences elsewhere too: pioneering webTV with livethelifetv (featured by Apple before YouTube even existed), chasing big waves as an ex-Quiksilver rider, turning a kitesurf school into debt-free freedom despite government red tape and fights with Booking.com giants.

Then Bitcoin entered the picture. I stacked hard at $3k–$8k bottoms, sold some moonshots earlier (GOOG, TSLA bags in 2014), and compounded into a life of renovated houses, stupidly good wines at sunset, and zero fiat chains.

I thought X would be the perfect place to share this journey: veteran insights on macro shifts, Bitcoin philosophy, the rediscovery of sound money as a moral tradition. But here’s the brutal truth in late 2025 — it’s not.

## Context

**The Algo’s Cruel Joke: Rewarding Noise Over Signal**

Today, X’s algorithm and monetization push volume, controversy, and degen energy. The creators flexing mid-4fig weekly ad revenue payouts? Often the same ones with years of rug-pull histories, meme coin shills, and outrage bait. The system temporarily favors noise because it drives replies, quotes, and engagement from Premium users (now the main payout metric).

Meanwhile, thoughtful voices — early adopters dropping actual alpha on privacy, sovereignty, and energy storage — get throttled. Views in the low hundreds, likes in single digits. It’s not a full shadowban, but the reach feels rigged against authenticity.

## Main

I’ve built bigger audiences before: 300k weekly views, posts averaging 1k likes, over 100M lifetime eyeballs on older platforms. Proven I can move culture. But translating that to current X? Frustrating as hell. The game changed, and right now, it pays scammers louder.

Yet... I still love the platform. Since 2007, it’s been my digital town square. And I refuse to become all-caps degen to game it.

While X grinds OGs, the Bitcoin revolution accelerates quietly.

This isn’t hype. It’s irreversible: Sound money base layer, tokenized dollars as rails, on-chain everything. Fiat debasement loses. Privacy and sovereignty win. Early misfits like us? Already living the endless summer.

**The Cheat Code Remains: Choose Stoke Daily**

## Conclusion

X might feel unfair right now, but Bitcoin doesn’t care about algos. It rewards those who front-load grind, stack quietly, and bet on themselves.

I’m shifting deeper here on Substack for long-form signal — no character limits, no throttle. But I’ll keep posting on X too. Because OGs built this space. And eventually, the pendulum swings back to quality.
