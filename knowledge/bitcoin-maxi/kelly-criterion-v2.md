In 1956, a scientist at Bell Labs named John Kelly figured out something that sounds almost too good to be true: when you have a genuine edge, there is a single “perfect” amount to bet that will make your money grow faster than any other strategy, over and over again, for decades, while still protecting you from ever going completely broke. That perfect amount is called the Kelly Criterion.

It’s not gambling advice. It’s the mathematical law of how to get as rich as possible, as fast as possible, when you’ve actually found something that wins far more than it loses. Most of the time the answer is surprisingly small. If your edge is modest, Kelly tells you to risk only a tiny sliver of your money each time. That’s why professional gamblers and the sharpest investors usually sound boring and cautious. But when the edge is enormous (when the reward is many times bigger than the risk, and you’re extremely unlikely to lose everything forever), the same rule does something that feels insane: it tells you to go in huge. Sometimes 70 %, sometimes 80 %.

## Context

That’s not greed talking. That’s the cold, calm voice of long-term compounding saying, “If you’re really right about this one, the fastest way to a life-changing fortune is to stop pretending this is just another investment and treat it like the rare monster opportunity it is.”

Very few people in history have ever stumbled across an opportunity extreme enough for Kelly to scream “bet heavy.” A handful of early tech investors did it with companies like Apple or Amazon in the 1990s. A quiet group of Bitcoiners did it starting around 2011–2015. They didn’t get rich because they were geniuses at predicting the future. They got rich because when they became convinced they had found a once-in-a-lifetime asymmetry, they obeyed the same rule Kelly discovered in 1956 and refused to leave 90 % of the payoff on the table out of fear or social pressure. Bitcoin, for anyone who truly believes its story isn’t over, is that kind of opportunity again.

The difference between putting in 10 % and putting in 80 % isn’t “a little more upside.” It’s the difference between doing very well and never having to think about money again, ever, for multiple generations. That gap is so large that the math says fear is the far bigger risk. The Kelly Criterion isn’t about being reckless. It’s about being honest: when something this lopsided comes along, the truly reckless move is staying small.

You don’t need to be a genius to get rich holding Bitcoin. You just need one rule that almost nobody follows. Put 80 % of everything you own into Bitcoin and then do absolutely nothing aggressive with it for ten, twenty, thirty years.

## Main

That sounds insane to most people. It sounded insane to me the first time I heard it too. But once you understand the quiet math behind the Kelly Criterion, it stops sounding crazy and starts sounding obvious.

Here’s why 80 % is actually the calm, rational, almost conservative number. Bitcoin is the single most asymmetric bet most humans will ever see in their lifetime. Roughly once every four years it has gone up 10× or more from the bottom of the previous bear market. Sometimes it did 30× or 50×. Sometimes it “only” does 3–4× and still makes you rich.

If you believe—even a little—that Bitcoin has a realistic chance of doing another 5×, 10×, or 20× over the next decade (and almost every cycle in its history says that’s not just possible, it’s the base case), then the mathematics of repeated bets tells you exactly how much you should own.

The Kelly Criterion asks: “What fraction of my money should I put into the best opportunity I will ever see so that my wealth grows the fastest possible without guaranteeing I go broke?” When the payoff is this lopsided and the time horizon is long, Kelly spits out a shockingly high number—often 70–100 % of your net worth for anyone who genuinely believes Bitcoin is going much higher and is unlikely to permanently go to zero.

Eighty percent is not reckless. Eighty percent is what “full Kelly” looks like when the upside is this big and the downside is “I might have to wait longer and live a little more simply for a few years.”

Think of it this way:

- 
If you put 10 % or 20 % in Bitcoin and it does another 10×, you’ll do great. You’ll have a very nice life.

- 
If you put 80 % in Bitcoin and it does another 10×, you will never have to think about money again. Ever. Your children won’t either.

That difference is the entire game. Most people can’t stomach 80 %. They worry about a 50 % or 80 % crash (which has happened in every single cycle and always recovered). They worry about what friends will say. They worry they’ll look stupid if they’re wrong. The beautiful part: you don’t have to be right on the exact timing or the exact multiple. You only have to be directionally right once or twice per decade, and the math does the rest.

Eighty percent is the size that turns a merely good outcome into a generational fortune—and still leaves you 20 % in cash, stablecoins, or whatever so you can pay rent, buy groceries, and sleep without checking the price every ten minutes during the next bear market. It is the sweet spot where you are no longer hoping Bitcoin makes you rich. You have mathematically forced it to.

The rule is dead simple:

- 
Move 80 % of whatever you have—savings, stocks, house equity, everything—into Bitcoin as fast as is safely possible.

- 
Move the other 20 % into cold, hard cash or stablecoins so a 90 % crash feels like a paper cut instead of a heart attack.

- 
Do nothing else that is clever. No leverage, no weekly options, no altcoins “just in case.” Nothing.

- 
Go live your life. Travel, start a company, learn to surf—whatever you actually care about.

Ten or twenty years from now you will look up and discover the quiet equation did all the work while you were busy living. Eighty percent is not a prediction.
It is the mathematical price of admission to the best game most of us will ever be offered. Pay it once, then forget the price exists. The people who will be unfathomably wealthy in 2035 already know this. The only question is whether you’re ready to join them.

Angel investing is the classic “power-law” domain: most checks go to zero, a few go 10–100×, and every once in a while one returns 1,000× or more. When you plug realistic numbers into Kelly for a typical angel portfolio (say ~80–90 % total loss rate, average winner maybe 20–50×, with the rare home-run skewing everything), the optimal allocation to the asset class as a whole is tiny, often 1–5 % of net worth, sometimes less.

So writing small angel checks with a small slice of the portfolio isn’t being “conservative.” It’s full-Kelly aggression in a world where the base rates are brutal. You’re actually betting exactly as hard as the math says you can without eventually blowing up.
> 
Bitcoin is the mirror-image case: an asset where the historical base rates are the opposite. That flips the Kelly fraction from “a few percent” to “most of your net worth.” Same equation, totally different input probabilities → totally different output size. We’re already living the Kelly life; we just switch from “sprinkle a little on angels” to “load the boat on Bitcoin”. 

Most people never notice the rule is the same in both places. 

We did. 

## Conclusion

That’s why the 80 % rule feels natural instead of insane to us. 

NFA. DYOR.
