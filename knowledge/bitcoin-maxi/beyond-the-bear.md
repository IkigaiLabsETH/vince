As the embers of the 2024–2025 bull market cool into what feels like an interminable winter, it’s natural to fixate on the immediate frostbite: the 50-week SMA’s unyielding breach, the 40% plunge from $125K highs, and the chorus of seasoned voices declaring the cycle’s demise. But buried in the bearish dispatches from Peter Brandt, Ben Cowen, Ansem, and Chris Burniske lies a quieter, more tantalizing thread, one that whispers not just of survival, but of resurrection. These analysts, for all their tactical pessimism, remain unapologetic long-term bulls on Bitcoin. Their charts and models don’t end at capitulation; they arc toward the next summit, projected for 2029 around the fourth halving’s glow. What might that peak look like? 

Drawing from their recent analyses and historical extrapolations, we can sketch a probabilistic map of the 2029 bull cycle: shallower parabolas, institutional ballast, and targets clustering around $200K–$500K, with outliers pushing higher on adoption tailwinds.

## Context

Peter Brandt’s classical charting lens offers the crispest blueprint. The 50-year trading veteran has long framed Bitcoin’s trajectory through “exponential decay”, each successive bull run tracing a shallower curve on semi-log scales, with peaks multiplying by diminishing factors (100x in 2011, 50x in 2013, 20x in 2017, ~4x in 2021). If the current bear carves Bitcoin down to $50K (his base-case low, aligning with the 200-week SMA’s projected rise), the rebound should cap at $200K–$250K by Q3 2029. This isn’t hopium; it’s math derived from five flawless cycle precedents, where post-parabola violations trigger 75%+ drawdowns before the next leg up. Brandt’s full disclosure, he still holds 40% of his all-time max BTC position at an average cost “1/20th of Saylor’s”, underscores his conviction: this dump is “the best thing that could happen to Bitcoin,” purging excess froth for a cleaner ascent. Contrast this with the $1M dreams peddled by Cathie Wood or Brian Armstrong; Brandt dismisses them as cycle-blind exuberance, betting instead on measured symmetry. His 2029 target implies a ~4–5x gain from the bear bottom, a far cry from prior multiples but still transformative for patient accumulators.

Ben Cowen’s quantitative rigor echoes Brandt’s restraint, though with a data-driven nod to macro lags. The PhD engineer’s models hinge on midterm-year determinism, 2026 as the inevitable trough year, echoing 2014, 2018, and 2022, followed by a post-halving ramp into 2028–2029. He doesn’t pin an exact peak price, but his framework suggests a ~3–4x lift from the $60K–$70K low he eyes for October–December 2026, landing Bitcoin around $200K–$280K by late 2029. Cowen’s edge lies in moving-average fidelity: the 200-week SMA, that unbreakable regime line, will have grinded to ~$80K–$90K by cycle’s end, serving as the launchpad. Where Brandt sees chart purity, Cowen layers in monetary echoes, like QT’s 2019 lag, which crushed alts before BTC’s solo rally, warning that 2029’s bull could again favor Bitcoin dominance (potentially spiking to 70%+ mid-cycle) before any meaningful alt rotation. Yet, his optimism shines through: “Bear markets are normal,” he reminds us, positioning the pain as prelude to a “non-euphoric” but steady climb, buoyed by ETF maturity and global M2 expansion.

Ansem’s altcoin-centric worldview adds a sharper, more speculative edge to the 2029 forecast, framing the current “echo bubble” as mere foreplay to a decade-long Bitcoin supremacy play. The trader who parlayed $8M into $300M on Solana calls doesn’t mince words: without total3 (alt market cap) reclaiming 2021 highs, we’re in “year four of a ten-year bear,” but one that culminates in BTC flipping gold’s market cap by 2030–2035. His implied 2029 BTC target? North of $500K, as “digital gold” outshines fiat entropy amid regulatory thaw and TradFi integrations. Ansem hedges with longs in privacy plays like ZEC (eyeing top-10 status) and hype machines like Hyperliquid, but his macro bet is BTC-centric: if it ATHs versus gold in this cycle’s dregs, the next one explodes. This isn’t blind faith; it’s rooted in structural shifts, stablecoin perps entrenching USD but ceding ground to unseizable assets. For alts, he envisions a brutal cull (95% to zero), with survivors like SOL or AI-blockchain hybrids delivering 10–30x betas off a $300K–$500K BTC base. Ansem’s vibe: The 2029 bull isn’t about moonshots; it’s about Bitcoin’s quiet conquest, with alts as high-octane side quests.

## Main

Chris Burniske, the Placeholder VC partner and Cryptoassets co-author, brings the most philosophical breadth, viewing 2029 through Carlota Perez’s “technological surge” lens: We’re midway in the Frenzy phase, with Deployment (steady, 10–100x compounding) kicking in post-2026. His targets are probabilistic and asset-agnostic, but he sketches BTC at $250K–$400K by 2029, driven by “deflationary” blockchains and institutional permanence (ETFs as the new “Mag7”). Burniske debunks supercycle myths but expects ETH to flip its 2021 narrative, rallying to new highs ($10K–$15K) en route to BTC’s shadow. Like Ansem, he eyes ZEC’s BTC-pair resilience as a bellwether, consolidation at cycle bottoms signaling outperformance in the next leg. His contrarian edge: Volatility compresses, but “pessimism and short-termism” at the 2026 low ($60K) will forge 2030s winners. Burniske’s call isn’t a number; it’s a mindset, trim now, accumulate majors (BTC, ETH) at the 200-week floor, and let Perez’s waves carry the rest.

Synthesizing these voices, the 2029 bull emerges as a tale of tempered ambition: $200K–$500K for BTC, with $250K as the consensus median, implying 3–8x from the bear nadir. Alts? A bloodbath yielding to selective glory, ETH to $10K+, SOL to $500–$1K, privacy/AI niches 20x-ing off BTC’s base. Catalysts align: The 2028 halving midpoints the cycle, Fed normalization lags into liquidity, and nation-state adoption (e.g., Trump’s rumored reserves) adds rocket fuel. 

## Conclusion

Risks? Exponential decay accelerates if institutions over-hedge, or macro black swans (recession redux) shave peaks to $150K. Yet, the throughline is unmistakable: This bear forges the forge. Brandt’s “dumping is the best thing,” Cowen’s “trade the market you have,” Ansem’s “crypto trade just beginning,” Burniske’s “patient alpha”, they all point to 2029 as vindication.

In the end, these forecasts aren’t crystal balls; they’re Bayesian bets, refined by scars from cycles past. As we hunker down toward that $60K–$70K 200-week rendezvous, let them fuel the fire: The next bull won’t eclipse the mania of 2021, but it’ll etch Bitcoin deeper into the monetary firmament. Stack sats at the bottom, diversify judiciously into the survivors, and remember, the cycle is dead only until it’s reborn, right on schedule.
