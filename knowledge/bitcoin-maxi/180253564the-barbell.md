## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Barbell Strategy**: A dual-approach investment strategy emphasizing a high allocation to low-risk assets (e.g., Bitcoin) while maintaining a smaller portion in higher-risk opportunities (e.g., stablecoins and options).
- **Survival Over Alpha**: Prioritizing long-term survival and sustainability of investments over seeking high returns, acknowledging the historical volatility and risks in crypto markets.
- **Weekly Options Engine**: A tactical method for generating income via options trading, leveraging market volatility to create consistent cash flow.
- **Canonical Allocation**: A framework for asset allocation that emphasizes a strong focus on Bitcoin, backed by stablecoins and selective high-potential investments.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Evaluate investment opportunities through the lens of risk versus reward, always considering the implications for long-term survival. Use historical data to inform decisions but recognize that past metrics can be misleading in current contexts.
- Apply a barbell strategy to portfolio construction, balancing low-risk assets with high-potential, yet speculative investments. Reassess allocations regularly based on market conditions and evolving opportunities.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Identify market signals that indicate a shift in asset valuations, particularly when investments are priced excessively high relative to revenue (e.g., comparing crypto asset P/S ratios to established companies like Amazon).
- Monitor the resilience of assets through market cycles, paying attention to which projects maintain user engagement and revenue generation amidst market downturns.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Apply the barbell strategy to your own investment portfolios, ensuring a significant portion is allocated to Bitcoin while using the remaining capital for tactical opportunities in stablecoins and selective high-growth projects.
- Use options trading strategically to enhance returns and generate passive income, focusing on metrics like delta and annualized returns to guide decisions.
- Anticipate future trends based on historical outcomes in the crypto ecosystem, positioning yourself to adapt as the market evolves toward more sustainable business models.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodologies and strategies rather than specific numbers or dates, keeping your analysis relevant to current market dynamics.
- Extract the "how to think" approach for practical application, ensuring your strategies are adaptable to changing market conditions.
- Keep the insights actionable, enabling immediate implementation in investment strategies.

We don’t run a fund. We don’t have LPs asking for quarterly beauty parades. We run a studio. A vault, an options engine, and a checkbook that only opens when something feels like the kind of bet we would still make at 4 a.m. with our own stables and no one watching.

This is the underwriting of how we position for the 2nd half of this decade.

## Context

I. The Core Axiom – Survival Trumps Alpha**

The market has killed more early believers than late skeptics. 

We have the scars to prove it. 

## Main

2017: ICO founders with nine-figure treasuries → insolvent by 2019**2021: DeFi gods with $3 billion TVL → $6.9 million treasuries by 2023
2024–25: AI-agent founders with $900 million FDVs → $38k monthly revenue

We are done auditioning for that movie.

So the book is a barbell forged in actual blood: 80 % Bitcoin 

Cold. Multisig. Geographically redundant offline keys.
Zero lending, zero CeFi, zero “just 1.8× on Binance with my house.”

This is the part that prints new all-time highs in every unit that has ever mattered while the rest of the industry debates whether 400× revenue is “early.”

20 % Stablecoins – The Only Risk Capital We Ever Touch**

Not idle. It is working three jobs harder than 95 % of crypto hedge funds.

- 
The Weekly Options Engine**HYPE secured puts + covered calls, 0.25–0.35 delta.
2025 realized: 1.1–2.3 % per week net → 70–160 % annualized on collateral.

- 
The Conviction Angel Book via ECHO
Cheques into teams that already ship revenue, already own users, and do not need another meme season to survive. We expect nine out of ten to die. We expect the tenth to return 10–100×. That math has never lost over a decade. 

- 
The Opportunistic 1x Bucket 
Micro yield on megaETH because real-time Ethereum is non-negotiable and the team is terrifyingly good. Occasional 1x Mag-7 baskets on Hyperliquid when NVDA drops 9 % and we’d rather deploy stables than sell a single sat.

II. Why This Barbell Wins 2025–2030**

Most portfolios today are still priced for perpetual 2021:

- 
$300–400 billion L1s generating $1–2 billion collective revenue

- 
Treasuries torching $300–800 million a year on subsidies and airdrops

We have seen the sequel. 

We know the ending.

The weighing machine always arrives.

When it does, only four things will matter:

- 
Bitcoin

- 
A handful of on-chain companies that look like actual businesses

- 
Stablecoins quietly marching to $2 trillion+

- 
The one or two L1s that survive the great unbundling

**III. The Amazon Chart Crime**

At ~$350 billion market cap it was doing $136 billion revenue → 2.6× P/S

Ethereum investors are paying ~136× more for each dollar of revenue than Amazon investors did. Solana investors are paying ~30× more for each dollar of revenue than Amazon investors did.

**IV. The Eternal Law**

2017 → open ICO platforms → Coinbase wins**2021 → open lending protocols → Binance wins
2025 → open L1s + open stablecoins → Stripe, JPMorgan, BlackRock, win

V. Canonical Allocation – Winter 2025**

80 % BTC – the only asset that survives every future
20 % USDC/USDT0/USDH working three jobs:

- 
Weekly options engine (70–160 % annualized cash flow)

- 
Conviction angel book via ECHO

- 
Tiny 1x opportunistic taste (HYPE, megaETH, Mag-7 dips)

Zero exposure to anything trading above 80× revenue, anything that needs another meme cycle, anything whose moat is poetry.

We are irresponsibly long crypto.
We have been since 2013.

We just refuse to be irresponsibly long delusion.

The barbell is the thesis.
The barbell is the studio.

See you at 210K+ Bitcoin.

## Conclusion

In a decade, when the history books are written by the people who actually made it through the winter, they won’t talk about the chains that promised to be nations, the tokens that promised to be AWS, or the founders who priced themselves for immortality in 2021. They’ll talk about the quiet ones who kept their bitcoin cold, their risk defined, and their convictions small enough to survive but sharp enough to compound. The ones who understood that the greatest asymmetry in this game was never leverage—it was survival. We plan to be those people. And when the sun finally comes up on the other side of this long crypto winter, we’ll still be here: older, and still irresponsibly long; only this time with scars that tell the story and a stack that never asked permission.

Onward.
