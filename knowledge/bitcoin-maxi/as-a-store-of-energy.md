I’m staring at a clip of Jensen Huang—yes, the NVIDIA guy, the one whose company is worth more than most countries—saying the quiet part out loud on stage last Sunday. He didn’t shill Bitcoin like some hoodie-wearing influencer. He just looked dead into the camera and said, calm as you like: “Bitcoin is taking excess energy and storing it as a new form called currency. You take that currency wherever you’d like. You took energy from one place and transported it everywhere.”

I actually paused the video, rubbed my eyes, and said out loud to my empty living room: “Motherfucker.” Because he’s right. And I hate that he’s right. I’ve spent fifteen years rolling my eyes at crypto people, and now the dude who prints the chips that run the entire AI circus just rewrote thermodynamics in one sentence. For the last 10.000 years energy has had 3 iron laws:

## Context

- Use it or it literally dies screaming into heat.

- Move it and you lose half of it in wires or pay a fortune in trucks.

- If you’re not sitting on top of the flame, you’re paying rent to the guy who is.

## Main

That wasn’t ideology. It was physics. Brutal, boring, unbeatable physics.

Then some nerds in 2009 figured out how to turn wasted joules into a token that teleports globally at the speed of light. And MSM spent a decade calling them all scammers.

Here’s the thing that keeps me awake now.

Last year in Texas—Texas!—they threw away eight terawatt-hours of wind power. Eight. That’s enough to run the entire country of Norway for four months. Gone. Poof. Because the grid was full and the price went to negative twenty-three bucks a megawatt-hour. Farmers got paid to turn the turbines off.

Meanwhile, ten miles away, there’s a shipping container full of humming ASICs slurping that “negative” electricity like it’s free champagne, turning it into bitcoin that shows up in some kid’s wallet in Manila before the sun comes up.

The energy didn’t die. It just changed passports.\*\*

Remember 2018? I do. Vividly. A friend was freelancing for a big glossy mag, flew to Iceland on their dime to write a hit piece on bitcoin mining “destroying the planet.” Landed in Keflavik, rented a car, drove out to these giant warehouses in the middle of volcanic nowhere. Expected to find Satan’s own server farm.

Instead he found a bunch of chill Icelandic dudes in wool sweaters who showed him how they were using 100% geothermal that used to just vent into the atmosphere, paying taxes that funded the local hospital, and—get this—shutting down instantly whenever the grid needed power for houses. He wrote the hit piece anyway because the editor had already chosen the headline.

And now the same GPUs that train the AIs everyone’s panicking about are also the most perfectly elastic battery humanity has ever invented. Negative prices? They turn on. Prices spike? They vanish in milliseconds. Texas miners now balance the grid better than all the Tesla Megapacks combined. Actual utility execs have told me this off-record while drunk.

> It’s not even about “digital gold” anymore—Jensen didn’t say that once. He said portable energy. The first time in history energy escaped geography.

A village in Congo with a tiny hydro plant too small for the grid can now sell power to Berlin. An offshore wind farm in the North Sea that used to get curtailed can pay dividends to a teacher in Nairobi. Siberia’s Soviet dams that Moscow can’t sanction? Turns out you can’t sanction thermodynamics.

We’re watching the biggest wealth transfer since the spice routes, and yeah, it started with those basement nerds tinkering with second-hand rigs and spotty WiFi—but these days it’s outfits like American Bitcoin in Texas running the show, with 35,000 liquid-cooled servers mining 2% of the daily supply on renewable juice, backed by Hut 8 and the Trump boys no less. Nerds still got the code running, but now it’s grid-scale warehouses doing the heavy lifting.

I don’t know where this ends. Could still all go to zero, sure.

But the physics? The physics just flipped.

## Conclusion

Anyway. Next time your feed is full of people screaming that bitcoin wastes energy, [just send them that Jensen clip](https://youtube.com/shorts/IrcBR2WNzKA?si=4MHrpZ6ZecnGBl7a). Or better—ask them to explain how else we’re supposed to move stranded renewables across continents without losing 40% in transmission or waiting ten years for permits.

Night, fam. I’m going to bed before I buy another coin. Probably.
