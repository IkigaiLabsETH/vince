There is a moment in every Bitcoin cycle when the price collapses far enough that the collective memory of the last bear market snaps into perfect focus. Old charts resurface like ghosts. The same phrases return, spoken in the same exhausted tone: “It’s over.” “This time is different.” “Crypto is dead.” And then, almost overnight, the bottom forms in silence while no one is looking, because everyone is too busy declaring the experiment finished.

We are living through that moment again.

## Context

As I write this in early December 2025, Bitcoin trades just above 89K. Thirty-six percent below its October peak, down from the euphoric 126K that felt inevitable only weeks ago. The Fear and Greed Index has spent more time below twenty than above fifty all quarter. Exchange balances are rising, retail is gone, and the timeline is once again filled with farewell posts from people who swore they would never sell.In other words, everything feels exactly like November 2022, when Bitcoin bottomed near sixteen thousand dollars after the FTX bankruptcy turned a brutal bear market into a massacre.

That is why a single sentence has spread across CT with the speed and certainty of gospel: 89K is the new 16K. At first it sounds like cope, another coping mechanism from an industry that has elevated denial into performance art.

Yet the longer you stare at the evidence, the harder it becomes to dismiss. The price action since July has tracked the 2022–2023 bear with almost uncanny fidelity. Monthly candles correlate at 98 percent. Daily moves sit at 80 percent. The summer grind lower, the autumn acceleration of pain, the November flush that finally breaks the spirits of the remaining leveraged bulls; it is the same script, merely translated into larger numbers.

## Main

But translation is the key word.

The market is not repeating; it is rhyming in a higher register.

> The drawdown is shallower, the capitulation less violent, the ecosystem immeasurably stronger. In 2022 the collapse was existential. Contagion tore through centralized lenders, stablecoins depegged, and an entire major exchange vaporized customer funds overnight. This time the triggers have been mundane by comparison: a large exchange hack, profit-taking after a parabolic move, and a Federal Reserve that paused its rate-cutting cycle one meeting too soon. Painful, yes. Apocalyptic, no.

That difference matters more than any fractal overlay.

Six years ago 16K was the price at which the entire dream almost died. Today 89K is the price at which institutions are quietly accumulating through regulated spot ETFs that did not exist in 2022. It is the price at which nation-states are buying for reserves, at which public companies are issuing convertible debt to stack more, at which the realized price of the average coin is still comfortably higher, meaning most holders remain in profit even after the correction. The psychology feels identical because fear is always identical, but the underlying reality has been transformed.

This is what maturing assets do. The crashes grow up along with the market cap. In 2014 a 50-percent drop took Bitcoin from 1.2K to $200. In 2018 a 85 percent drop took it from 20K to $3200. In 2022 a 75 percent drop took it from 69K to 16K. Each time the percentage decline softened while the dollar decline grew exponentially larger, because the base had grown. We are simply watching the next iteration of the pattern. The violence measured in percentage terms is diminishing even as the absolute dollar swings feel more terrifying than ever.

That terror is the point. Bitcoin has always needed to scare away the tourists before the real move begins. The 2022 bottom did not arrive when analysts declared the coast clear; it arrived when the timeline was nothing but suicide hotlines and liquidation screenshots. Today’s timeline is not quite that dark, but it is close enough. The fact that people can even joke about 89K being the new 16K is itself evidence we are scraping the bottom of the sentiment barrel.

History will not repeat with precision, of course. There will be no 700 percent rally from here that lands us at 650K in 2026, if only because the starting price is already so much higher. But history does not need to repeat; it only needs to maintain direction. A mere return to the prior all-time high would take us past 125K within months. A standard post-halving parabolic phase (and we remain well inside the historical window) would carry us far beyond that. The same models that called the 2021 top and the 2022 bottom continue to point higher on every timeframe longer than one year.

None of this is guaranteed. Bitcoin has broken every model at least once. Yet the weight of probability has shifted decisively. The same on-chain indicators that flashed extreme distress in November 2022 (realized losses, spent-output-profit-ratio below one, exchange inflows from long-term holders) are flashing again now. The same technical setups that preceded every major rally of the past decade (oversold stochastic, hidden bullish RSI divergence, volume drying to nothing) are present in textbook fashion. The same macro backdrop that finally allowed risk assets to breathe in early 2023 (liquidity injection after a banking crisis) is assembling once more, only this time the liquidity comes deliberately from fiscal stimulus and central-bank balance-sheet expansion rather than emergency bailouts.

> Perhaps most telling of all is the silence. The loudest voices from the top are gone. The influencers who called for 200K by Christmas have deleted their charts. The tourists who arrived in 2024–2025 have been rinsed. What remains is the stubborn core who were also here the last time the price was “obviously” going to zero. That core is buying, quietly, methodically, without fanfare, because they have seen this movie before and they know how it ends.

Eighty-nine thousand dollars will not feel like the bottom for long. One day soon, maybe next month, maybe next quarter, we will look back at these prices the same way we now look back at sixteen thousand: not with embarrassment at how obvious it was, but with awe at how cheap it once was.

## Conclusion

Until then the market will do what it always does at true bottoms. It will convince as many people as possible that the story is over, that the halving cycle failed, that institutions were just renting and have now left forever. It will print one more wick lower, maybe several, just to be sure the last weak hands are gone. And then, without announcement or permission, it will begin the next leg higher. Welcome to the new sixteen thousand dollars.

Try not to spend it all in one place.
