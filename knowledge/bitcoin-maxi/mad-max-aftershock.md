Look, it’s 2 a.m. again, and I’m hunched over this goddamn laptop. Scrolling through yet another thread on X about how AI’s gonna “revolutionize” everything—yeah, right, revolutionize us right into breadlines. Reminds me of that night back in ‘08, during the crash, when I was still pretending to be a real journalist, chasing leads on Lehman Brothers from a fancy surf resort. 

I filed this “exclusive” on how the feds would never let it all burn, only to wake up to my editor spiking it because it was too “alarmist.” Ha. Lost my gig shortly after, ended up ghostwriting for some crypto bro who thought Bitcoin was the second coming. Embarrassing as hell—me, the guy who’d mocked blockchain as a Ponzi in the 2014-2015 era, probably coping because I sold in 2013, suddenly churning out puff pieces for rent money. But hey, it taught me: markets don’t crash clean; they limp along on printed cash and denial.

## Context

Honestly, if that whole [Mad Max](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/p/mad-max) nightmare we ranted about last time actually plays out—you know, AI steamrolling 300 million jobs by 2030, unemployment hitting 50 percent, the middle class scraping by on shitty gigs while the rich bunker up with their bots—then screw it, I’m calling Bitcoin our best shot at a hedge. Not some elite playtoy, though it kinda is, but this stubborn digital gold that’s built to ride out the crapstorm when central banks start flooding the system with funny money to keep the lights on. We’re talking debasement on steroids, where they print to infinity just to stop everything from imploding. 

And yeah, it works—in a twisted way.

Here’s the thing: we’ve gotta cling to something solid like the ISM Manufacturing PMI—it’s basically the crystal ball for business cycles, the one every analyst swears by, even if they’ve botched calls before. Right now, those leading indicators? They’re whispering a decent recovery for 2026. 

## Main

The ISM’s still in contraction mode but not screaming doom.

Lagging stuff like jobs, trucking, lending— that’s all rearview mirror crap, echoes of the slowdown we’re shaking off. Gives us a breather from AI’s job-eating frenzy, lets Bitcoin chill and climb on quiet money easing instead of full-blown freakout. Could be wrong here, markets love to humble you, but it feels like a soft landing... for now.

But wait, don’t get comfy. This uptick? It’s fragile as hell. Come 2027, if the banks tighten liquidity to choke off inflation from all that AI productivity hype—boom, slowdown city. Picture the S&P tanking 20 percent, Nasdaq down 30, Bitcoin getting gutted by 60. Painful? Absolutely. 

But an 80 percent wipeout like the doomers predict? Nah, zero chance. 
> 
They’ve got that debasement lever—print more fiat, watch asset prices “rise” because the dollar’s turning to trash. Every central bank picks that over a real reset; it’s their go-to since ‘71. I fell into that trap once, thinking a big cleanse was coming, until I wrapped my head the fact that it’s just trading 8 percent yearly erosion for avoiding total meltdown. No free lunch, just less starvation. 

I swear, if AI sparks a blow-off top this year—everyone hyped on robot utopias and endless growth—it won’t be the start of some epic bear apocalypse. 

Just a peak in a bigger bull run, with debasement ready to catch the fall. 

Bitcoin soaks it up, our hedge in the chaos. 

Kind of wild, right? 

And looking ahead, the real super cycle top? 

Probably not till 2030 or later, when AI and bots finally crank GDP faster than debt piles up—check that Economic Singularity thesis if you haven’t. 

Then, maybe we don’t need the printing presses anymore, and Bitcoin shifts from shield to foundation in some post-scarcity dream. 

## Conclusion

Or nightmare. 

Anyway, next time you’re doomscrolling at midnight, try stacking a tiny bit of Bitcoin before closing the app, just as an experiment. See if it calms the nerves—or if I’m just full of it. Hit me up in the comments; we’re all winging this together.
