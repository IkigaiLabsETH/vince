I used to believe in retirement the way kids believe in Santa Claus: a comforting story told by adults who promised that if you just behaved, showed up every day, and fed the 401(k) like a obedient little squirrel, one day you’d wake up old, wealthy, and finally free.

Then Bitcoin hit me like lightning hits a tree. One second you’re rooted in the ordinary forest of fiat, the next you’re cracked wide open, smoking, and staring straight up at a different sky.

## Context

This isn’t a HODL pep talk. This is the autopsy of a dream that was never alive in the first place.

## The Lie We Were Sold

They branded it the American Dream, but it was always a deferred-life plan. Trade forty-five irreplaceable years for promises printed on paper by people who hit Ctrl+P whenever they get nervous. The deal: give us your prime, and we’ll hand you a watered-down version of it once your joints creak and your hunger for new ideas has gone quiet.

Naval Ravikant called retirement a dangerous fantasy for people stuck in jobs they hate. He was being kind. It’s not dangerous; it’s theft. The spreadsheet was always fiction. Inflation, sequence risk, exploding medical bills, living too long—every assumption was scribbled in disappearing ink by the same experts who flip-flopped on eggs every decade.

The real crime, though, wasn’t the math. It was the philosophy.

We were trained to believe purpose comes with an expiration date. That one day you clock out, cash in, and morph into a professional sunset-watcher. As if the fire that once dragged you out of bed at 3 a.m. could be switched off without switching off the rest of you.

Ask any champion who finally grabbed the belt and woke up empty the next day. Ask any founder who cashed out nine figures and realized the mission, not the money, was the only thing keeping him breathing. The summit is cold and barren. The climb was everything.

## The Block Height Never Stops

Bitcoiners live inside this truth because the network never takes a day off. No gold watch, no victory parade, no moment when Satoshi steps out of the shadows to pin a medal on your chest and say, “You’re finished.” There’s only the next block, the next halving, the next impossible puzzle a swarm of relentless weirdos will solve because stopping isn’t in their programming.

That isn’t a flaw. It’s the whole point.

Proof-of-work is the cure for the retirement delusion. Freedom isn’t a prize you cash in after decades of stacking; it’s mined, one costly hash at a time, every day you decide to stay sovereign.

When you hold your own keys, you can’t pretend someone else is coming to fix it. No pension. No bailout. No kindly bureaucrat who cares about you more than the next election cycle. Just you, your principles, and the steady drumbeat of block height.

That’s not a weight. It’s the purest meaning most of us will ever hold.

Meet Steve, the Millionaire Who Will Never Own One Whole Coin

Imagine Steve in 2025. Great guy. Eight-figure net worth. Mortgage almost gone. Kids in private schools. Two big trips a year. By every conventional scorecard, he crushed it.

You sit him down, slide the napkin across the table, and show him that his entire pile is worth about ten bitcoin today. That there are only 0.3 coins per millionaire on earth, and the ratio is getting worse fast.

Steve gets it in his head. He even allocates the polite 3–5% “just in case.” Then he goes home and rebalances his Vanguard fund like always.

Jump forward ten years. Bitcoin isn’t fringe anymore; it’s the planetary reserve asset. Steve’s traditional portfolio did okay, doubled in dollar terms. But the world has rotated ninety degrees. His accountant now mentions bitcoin the way people mentioned Bay Area real estate in 2010.

Steve moves fast for a normie. He refinances, rolls over the 401(k), takes prudent leverage. He finally owns almost half a coin.

By the time his old operating system fully reboots, one bitcoin costs more than everything he used to own combined dpi.

He scrapes together the last liquidity he can find and buys a few more scraps.

Steve will die rich in dollars and poor in sound money, always one cycle behind a train he watched leave the station while waiting for someone to tell him it was safe to board.

He’s not dumb. He’s normal.

And normal is the most expensive disease in hyperbitcoinization.

**The Silent Killer: Ego Masquerading as Edge**

Early on, risk feels like breathing. You’re swinging with five figures; worst case, you’ve got a good story.

Fifty-percent crashes are just tuition.

Then one morning the stack has too many zeros. The same moves that built it can now erase it in a weekend. The market doesn’t care that you were early and right; it only cares what you do today.

I’ve seen brilliant traders who turned thousands into tens of millions detonate because they couldn’t switch from hunter to farmer. They kept chasing the next 10x when their only job became “don’t become the cautionary tale.”

Wealth at scale changes the game. The objective stops being “more” and becomes “never back.” Doubling from one million to two feels nice. Dropping from one million to fifty thousand changes your address and your sleep forever.

Killing the old self that got you here is brutal. Most people would rather die holding the story than live holding the asset.

**The Antifragile Path**

There is another way, and it doesn’t look like any brochure ever printed.
\*\*
Design a life where the work feels like play. Need far less than the billboards trained you to crave. Move your savings into the one asset that can’t be diluted. Then keep creating, not because rent is due, but because creating is the only retirement plan that actually compounds.

I know photographers funding round-the-world trips by selling prints as Lightning invoices. Developers shipping open-source code from Portuguese cliff houses, paid in sats. Families homeschooling kids on catamarans, routing value across oceans without asking any government for permission.

None of them are waiting for an exit.

They live proof-of-work lives.

Their tools (human and machine) don’t rust; they upgrade. Their skills don’t soften on fairways; they sharpen against real problems. Their wealth isn’t hostage to insolvent institutions; it’s secured by the only network that gets stronger when attacked.

That’s what antifragile purpose feels like.

The Call\*\*

Choose your mountain.

Code. Art. Raising kids who will think of fiat the way we think of VHS tapes.

Start climbing today.

Because when you finally stand in the orange glow of a remade world, you’ll hear the quiet truth Bitcoin told you from day one: There is no final summit.

There’s only the next, stranger peak.

## Conclusion

And the climb (the daily, stubborn, creative, sovereign climb) is the entire point. The block height rises forever. Stay humble. Stack sats. Keep building.

Everything else is noise.
