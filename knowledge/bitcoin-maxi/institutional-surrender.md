That old Gandhi line was never meant for money, yet here we are in December 2025 and Bitcoin just completed the most predictable trilogy in financial history, act by act, laugh by laugh, punch by punch.

Act I: The Laughter (2009–2017)\*\*

## Context

It started with the chuckles of the elite. Jamie Dimon stood on stage in 2017, red tie blazing, and called Bitcoin a fraud worse than tulip bulbs. The audience roared. CNBC ran the clip on loop. Nouriel Roubini screamed “mother of all scams” so often that “Dr Doom” started sounding like a broken record. Ben Bernanke politely called it “an attempt to replace fiat currency” with the same tone you use when a toddler hands you a crayon drawing of a horse. Peter Schiff laughed loudest and longest, promising gold would bury this digital nonsense before breakfast. (to be fair Gold did outperform BTC this year)

Vanguard, the temple of low-cost indexing, the church of Jack Bogle, simply pretended Bitcoin didn’t exist. No ticker, no mention, no futures, nothing. If you called their customer service and asked about BTC, the polite midwestern voice would pause, then say, “Sir, we don’t offer speculative assets.” Translation: go play with your Pokémon cards somewhere else.

**Act II: The Fight (2018–2023)**

## Main

Laughter turned to fear, fear turned to warfare. Regulators rolled out the heavy artillery. The SEC rejected every spot ETF application with the mechanical cruelty of a stapler. SAB 121 forced banks to hold 100% capital against crypto custody, basically a polite way of saying “touch Bitcoin and we bankrupt you.” Senators wrote letters. Central bankers issued warnings. The Financial Stability Board called it a threat to global stability. China banned it outright. India threatened jail time. Jamie Dimon kept swinging, telling Congress in 2023 he would “close it down” if he were king.

Banks built moats. Morgan Stanley banned employees from even mentioning the word in client emails. Bank of America blocked credit-card purchases. Wells Fargo sent stern letters to anyone who dared wire money to Coinbase. Goldman Sachs opened a crypto desk in 2018, panicked at the first 80% drawdown, and quietly shuttered it again with the embarrassment of a teenager caught smoking.
\*\*
Vanguard doubled down on purity. They removed Bitcoin futures from their platform in 2022 with a press release so smug you needed sunglasses to read it. “We believe cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and add unnecessary risk.” The faithful nodded. The orange coin was a virus, and Vanguard had the strongest immune system on planet Earth.

Act III: The Win (2024–2025)\*\*

Then the virus mutated into penicillin. First the armor cracked. Grayscale sued the SEC and won. Spot ETFs were approved in January 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest-growing ETF in history. Fidelity’s FBTC hit $20 billion faster than any product since the invention of the wheel. Pensions tiptoed in. Wisconsin bought. Michigan bought. Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East started whispering.

The Fed cut rates six times. QT died quietly in a ditch. The dollar weakened. SAB 121 got repealed in a bipartisan vote that shocked everyone who still thought Washington could agree on pizza toppings.

One by one, the fighters dropped their gloves.

> Goldman reopened the crypto desk, this time with neon lights. JPMorgan, yes, the same JPMorgan whose CEO once wanted to nuke the entire industry, filed to let clients buy actual Bitcoin in May 2025. Dimon went on television, shrugged, and said “I still don’t like it, but clients have the right to be wrong.” Translation: we’re taking a fee on it now.

Bank of America told its wealth advisors they could recommend up to 4% in Bitcoin starting January 2026. Wells Fargo quietly started accepting it as loan collateral. Citigroup partnered with Coinbase. Morgan Stanley extended Bitcoin-backed credit lines. Even the Bank of New York Mellon, the 240-year-old grandfather of custody, now guards more crypto than most countries own in gold. And then came December 2, 2025.

Vanguard, the last fortress, the final monk in the monastery, the one institution that prided itself on never, ever, bending to trends, opened the gates. No press conference, no apology tour, just a quiet update: starting today, fifty million Vanguard accounts can buy spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ETFs.

BlackRock’s IBIT did a billion dollars of volume in the first thirty minutes. The price of Bitcoin jumped six percent while most of Wall Street was still pouring its first coffee. Somewhere, Jack Bogle is spinning so hard in his grave you could hook him up to the power grid.

The laughter is over. The fight is finished.

We are now deep into the part where you win, and the winning feels both inevitable and absurd. The most cautious asset manager on Earth, the one built on the gospel of “don’t try to time the market, just own the market,” has surrendered to an asset that didn’t exist when most of its clients were in college. The same firm that once treated Bitcoin like radioactive Pokémon cards now routes orders for it like it’s the S&P 500.

> This isn’t adoption. This is capitulation. This is the sound of an old world admitting the new one already won while it was busy writing sternly worded letters. Gold took generations to crawl from barbarian jewelry to central-bank reserve asset. Bitcoin did it before its seventeenth birthday, and now it’s getting invited to the adult table before it can legally drink.

The printers are warming up again. Rate cuts are baked in. The dollar is wobbling. Central banks are debating whether to add a zero and a one to their balance sheets in the form of digital gold. Nation-states are drafting strategic Bitcoin reserve bills. The same politicians who once wanted to ban it are now racing to see who can accumulate the most before the next halving.

There are only twenty-one million coins. Roughly four million are already lost forever. Another two million belong to people who would rather die than sell. That leaves maybe thirteen million for the rest of planet Earth, and planet Earth just realized it’s late to the party.

First they laughed. Then they fought. Now they’re frantically refreshing their brokerage apps, hoping there’s still some left before the next wave shows up.

Welcome to the victory lap. It’s going to be the loudest, wildest, most expensive party finance has ever seen, and the guest of honor is a seventeen-year-old string of code that just made the most powerful institutions on Earth say unc.

## Conclusion

Grab your popcorn, or better yet, grab your keys.

The third act is just getting started.
