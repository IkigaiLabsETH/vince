Imagine a savings account that pays you roughly 10 % a year, sends the money to you every single month, never forces you to sell, and is backed by more than seven times its value in actual Bitcoin. If the price of Bitcoin falls in half tomorrow, you still get paid and you still own your shares. If Bitcoin goes up 5× over the next decade, the company behind it quietly buys more Bitcoin with your money and keeps paying you the whole time.

That product now exists.

It’s called Stretch (ticker: $STRC).

It was launched in July 2025 by Michael Saylor and his company Strategy. Most crypto people will tell you “just buy Bitcoin and hold it forever.” They’re not wrong. If you’re willing to read a couple of good books, ignore the price for four or five years, and treat it like digital gold, nothing else on the planet has beaten Bitcoin over any ten-year period.

But let’s be honest:

- 
Your brother-in-law isn’t going to do that.

- 
Your parents definitely aren’t.

- 
The pension fund that controls your 401(k) isn’t allowed to.

- 
The $6.5 trillion sitting in boring money-market funds isn’t moving into a Coinbase account next Tuesday.

Most normal humans want three things from their money:

- 
Don’t lose it all.

- 
Make more than the 0.5 % the bank gives them.

- 
Sleep at night.

Stretch was built for exactly those people.

## What Stretch Is

So what actually is Stretch?

It’s a share you can buy on the normal stock market (Nasdaq) for about $100. Every month the company sends you a dividend (right now roughly 83 cents per share, which works out to ~10 % a year). That dividend is paid for by the gigantic pile of Bitcoin the company already owns (over 650,000 coins worth roughly $60–70 billion depending on the day).

Here’s the clever part:

They own seven Bitcoin dollars for every one dollar of Stretch shares they sold you. If Bitcoin crashes, they still have seven times more Bitcoin sitting there than they owe you. If Bitcoin moons, they use the extra value to buy even more Bitcoin and keep the dividend going forever.
> 
It’s like lending money to the wealthy guy who already has seven houses and is using your loan to buy an eighth house that keeps going up in value.

Why this feels like cheating (but isn’t)

Most bonds or preferred shares have an end date: “We’ll pay you 5 % for ten years and then give your $100 back.” Stretch has no end date. Ever.

That means the company gets to keep your money forever the money you gave them, and they promise to keep paying you every month as long as Bitcoin exists. And because of the way accountants and the IRS look at it, a big chunk of what they send you every month is classified as “return of capital” not “income.”
Translation: you probably pay a lot less tax than you would on normal dividends or interest.

## The Closest Real-World Comparison

Think of Stretch as the love child between:

- 
A super-safe utility company preferred stock (boring, steady dividends)

- 
A money-market fund (cash every month, tiny price moves)

- 
And actually owning Bitcoin (but without the heart-attack-inducing 50 % drops)

It’s Bitcoin for people who still call it “Bit-Coin” and think Elon Musk invented it. Who is already buying it?

- 
Retirees who are furious that CDs pay 4 %

- 
Family offices that want Bitcoin exposure but can’t put it on the books yet

- 
European and Asian funds that are barred from buying Bitcoin directly

- 
Regular people on Robinhood and Fidelity who just saw “10 % yield” and clicked buy

In the first four months the company sold more than $2.5 billion dollars of Stretch. They took that money, bought another 30,000+ Bitcoin, and everyone went home happy.

The Michael Saylor cheat code**

Saylor’s actual genius wasn’t inventing Bitcoin (he didn’t). It was realising that the biggest problem Bitcoin has isn’t technology or regulation; it’s psychology. Most people are simply unwilling to watch their life savings swing 20 % in a weekend. So he stripped out the scary part and kept the good part (the long-term growth and the yield that comes from holding the hardest money ever created). He turned Bitcoin into something your uncle can brag about at Thanksgiving without lying: “Yeah, I own some of that Bitcoin stuff… gets me 10 % a year, pays monthly, hasn’t lost a cent of principal.”

**Should you just buy Bitcoin instead?**

If you’re reading this on a crypto-native Substack, the answer is still yes.**Buy Bitcoin, put it in cold storage, and check the price again in 2030.
You’ll almost certainly do better than Stretch over the long run.

But if you want to send this article to your parents, your financial advisor, or that friend who “missed Bitcoin at $100,” Stretch is the first product that lets them participate without needing a 500-hour education or an iron stomach.

The bottom line**

Bitcoin itself is still the purest, highest-conviction bet on the future of money. Stretch is simply the most elegant bridge ever built between that future and the 99.9 % of humanity that isn’t ready to cross the river yet. 

## Conclusion

And bridges, when built well, can carry trillions.

P.S. If you want to try a tiny experiment, buy one single share of $STRC (~$100) and just watch the dividends hit your brokerage account every month. It’s the closest thing to see Bitcoin’s monetary premium turned into cold, hard, boring cash flow; without ever having to hear another word about “private keys” or “HODL.” Welcome to the quietest revolution in finance.
