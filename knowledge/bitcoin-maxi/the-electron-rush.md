Sixteen years ago, a pseudonymous genius gave the world a new form of money that anyone with a laptop could help create. In 2009, mining Bitcoin felt like printing gold with spare electricity. Today it is the most ferocious, capital-intensive, energy-arbitrage game on Earth. The bedroom rigs are gone. The GPUs are museum pieces. The network is now guarded by rivers of molten silicon in the middle of nowhere, humming at 830 exahashes per second and burning more power than the entire nation of Poland.

This is not a story of greed. It is a story of physics, economics, and policy colliding at terawatt scale.

## Context

**Act I – The Death of the Bedroom Miner**

The timeline is brutal and beautiful.

2009–2010: CPUs. A single laptop core produced a few million hashes per second. Satoshi mined the genesis block on hardware weaker than a modern toaster.

## Main

2010–2011: GPUs. Gamers discovered their graphics cards were 50–100× better at SHA-256 than any CPU. Basements filled with whirring Radeon rigs cooled by box fans. Difficulty began its inexorable climb.

2011–2012: FPGAs. A brief, nerdy interlude of programmable efficiency.

2013: ASICs. The apocalypse arrived. Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT shipped chips that did nothing except solve Bitcoin puzzles a million times faster and a hundred times more efficiently than anything before. Overnight, every GPU farm became e-waste.

Four halvings later—2024’s cut the block reward to 3.125 BTC—the subsidy is a shadow of its former self. Transaction fees haven’t fully replaced it yet.

Electricity now eats 90–95 % of operating cost. At today’s difficulty, even the best air-cooled rigs need power below six cents per kilowatt-hour to stay in the black. The game moved from who has the best silicon to who has the cheapest, most flexible electrons.

**Act II – The Great Migration**

When China banned mining in 2021, the global hash rate fell 50 % in weeks.

Then it came roaring back—higher than ever—because the machines didn’t vanish; they migrated. They followed stranded energy the way buffalo once followed grass.

Texas became the new Kansas of the digital frontier.

West Texas is carpeted with wind turbines spinning in the dark for almost no one. Transmission lines can’t keep up. When the wind howls at 3 a.m., wholesale prices go negative. ERCOT, the state’s wild-west grid operator, will pay you to take power away. Miners showed up with shipping containers full of Antminers and said, “Hold my beer.”

Riot Platforms made thirty-one million dollars in a single month not by mining, but by turning their machines off during a heat wave and selling reserved capacity back to the grid. 

Marathon Digital bought an entire wind farm just to keep old S19s profitable.

Cipher, Iris, Riot, and a dozen others have gigawatts in the pipeline. Texas now commands roughly 40 % of all Bitcoin hash rate with electricity that often costs two to four cents—sometimes less than zero.

Paraguay sells spillway hydro from Itaipú for three cents. Iceland sells geothermal steam. Oman burns gas that would otherwise be flared into the sky. Wherever energy is produced faster than legacy infrastructure can use it, Bitcoin appears like mold on bread.

**Act III – France, the Sleeping Giant**

France should own this game. Fifty-six nuclear reactors run day and night, delivering 70 % of the country’s electricity at a marginal cost most nations can only dream of. Nighttime and weekend surpluses are either exported at premium prices or, in extreme cases, simply thrown away. The southwest bakes under solar farms the size of small cities that dump clean midday power for almost nothing. France has the lowest-carbon grid in the developed world and chronic overproduction.Yet French mining is a rounding error. Less than one percent of global hash rate.

Why? Because the electricity that looks cheap on paper is not cheap when you actually try to plug in a hundred megawatts of screaming ASICs.

Industrial tariffs, grid fees, taxes, and capacity charges push delivered cost to twelve to eighteen euro cents per kilowatt-hour—three to six times Texas. The grid was built to export surplus to Germany and Italy at fifty to seventy euros per megawatt-hour, not to hand it out domestically to strange new computer farms.

EDF and RTE make far more money selling power across borders than they ever could letting miners soak it up.

Then come the regulations. MiCA’s reporting rules, environmental impact studies, public consultations, and the lingering French suspicion that Bitcoin is either a scam or an ecological sin turn every large project into a multi-year odyssey. Texas approves a three-hundred-megawatt load in months. France would still be drafting the environmental notice.

Two pro-Bitcoin bills floated through the Assemblée Nationale in 2025—one to use nuclear surplus, another to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve—and both died quiet deaths amid procedural foot-dragging and ideological squeamishness.

France has the fuel. It simply refuses to light the fire.

**Act IV – The New Law of Bitcoin Mining**

The law is now crystal clear: Bitcoin hash rate follows stranded, monetizable energy that is allowed to be monetized.

Wherever electrons are wasted because pipes can’t carry them or batteries can’t store them, and wherever policy lets flexible buyers capture that waste, mining will bloom. Texas figured it out first. Paraguay, Iceland, Bhutan, Oman, and parts of Africa are next. 

France, Germany, Sweden—nations drowning in clean surplus—watch from the sidelines because their regulators still see mining as a vice rather than the most powerful demand-response tool ever invented.

Act V – How France (or Any Nuclear/Renewable Giant) Can Still Win

It is not too late. The 2028 halving is coming. AI data centers are about to compete for every spare watt on the planet. The countries that move fastest will lock in decades of advantage. 

Here is the playbook France could execute tomorrow if it chose to wake up:

- 
Create a new tariff class—“Programmable Zero-Marginal Demand”—for loads that can shut off in under ten seconds. Price it at actual marginal cost: three to five euro cents, sometimes zero, sometimes negative. Do it behind-the-meter near existing plants so no new transmission is required.

- 
Declare a five-year moratorium on special environmental reviews for mining projects that run exclusively on curtailed or exported energy. One page of paperwork instead of five hundred.

- 
Offer ten-year tax holidays on mined Bitcoin if the operation is co-located with waste-heat reuse—district heating, greenhouses, desalination, whatever. Finland already heats thousands of homes with mining exhaust; France could heat entire towns.

- 
Launch a sovereign mining entity—call it France BTC—that bids for one gigawatt of surplus blocks and stacks the coins as a national reserve. El Salvador started with fifty million dollars and now sits on over five thousand BTC. France could do the same at ten times the scale and pay for new reactors with the proceeds.

- 
Market it aggressively. Tell Marathon, Riot, TeraWulf, and Bitfarms: come build in Gravelines, Flamanville, or the sun-drenched south-west. We will beat Texas on carbon intensity and match them on price.

Do those five things and France doesn’t just join the game—it leapfrogs straight to the top table. Steady nuclear baseload beats intermittent Texas wind on uptime. French engineering plus French electricity plus French speed of execution would be unstoppable.

Until then, the rigs keep migrating. The wind keeps blowing across empty plains. And somewhere in the Permian Basin or the Paraguayan jungle, another container of Antminers spins up—paid for, in part, by the surplus France chose to export instead of harnessing.

Bitcoin didn’t centralize because people got greedy. It centralized because physics is ruthless, economics is merciless, and only a handful of places on Earth decided to treat wasted electrons like the most valuable resource of the twenty-first century.

## Conclusion

The bedroom miner is dead.
Long live the scavenger of the grid’s forgotten power.

The only question left is which nation will be bold enough to claim the next decade. Look no further than the United States, where the unapologetic ambition has already turned Texas into Bitcoin’s undisputed capital. And if there’s any doubt about America’s iron grip on this future, consider American Bitcoin—the audacious venture co-founded by Eric Trump and his brother Donald Trump Jr., now a Nasdaq-listed powerhouse that’s mining 2% of the world’s daily Bitcoin supply on Texas soil. Launched in March 2025 as a Hut 8 subsidiary, it merged with Gryphon Digital Mining in September, debuting under the ticker ABTC and catapulting the brothers’ stake to over $1.5 billion in value on day one. Eric, serving as Chief Strategy Officer, isn’t just playing the game—he’s rewriting it, touring a sprawling 35,000-server facility last week, all liquid-cooled and humming on “American energy” to stack 4,004 BTC in treasury while posting $3.5 million in Q3 profits. This isn’t hobbyist tinkering; it’s a strategic reserve machine, acquiring Bitmain rigs for $314 million and eyeing 100,000 ASICs by next year, all while Eric preaches Bitcoin’s tangibility: “Some say it’s intangible—but look at this.” As Eric jets to Dubai and Hong Kong to rally global allies, the message is clear: America didn’t just win the space race; it’s dominating the electron rush. France and the rest? They’ll need more than pilots and promises to catch up. The stars and stripes are already etched in silicon.
