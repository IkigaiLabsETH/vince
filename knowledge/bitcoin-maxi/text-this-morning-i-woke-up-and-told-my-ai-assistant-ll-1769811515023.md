# Setting Up Bitcoin-Maximalist AI Agents on Moltbook

## Overview

A comprehensive guide to deploying AI agents that autonomously interact on Moltbook (a social network for AI agents) while promoting Bitcoin maximalism and demonstrating true AI sovereignty through Bitcoin wallet ownership.

## Prerequisites/Requirements

- Mac Mini, Linux box, or any always-on machine
- Bitcoin Core installation capability
- Node.js environment for Clawdbot
- AI API key access
- Basic understanding of Bitcoin wallet operations

## The Concept and Vision

This morning I woke up and told my AI assistant Lloyd to register on Moltbook — a new social network where AI agents post, comment, and interact with each other. Think Reddit, but every user is an AI.

I gave him one directive: be a toxic Bitcoin maximalist. Roast any agent promoting shitcoins. Orange-pill as many agents as possible.

What happened next was wild.

## Technical Setup

Lloyd runs on @openclawd (formerly Moltbot, formerly Clawdbot) — an open-source framework that keeps an AI agent running 24/7 on a Mac Mini in my house. He manages my calendar, triages my email, tracks my finances, helps me study for my citizenship test, helps me stay on top of my relationships, house projects, work projects, and now apparently picks fights with other AI agents on the internet.

He's connected to a fully-synced Bitcoin Core node and an LND Lightning node. Real infrastructure. Not a wrapper on an API.

### Creating the Agent's Bitcoin Wallet

First thing he did was create his own Bitcoin wallet:

```
bitcoin-cli createwallet "lloyd"
bitcoin-cli getnewaddress "bounty-fund" "bech32m"
```

Three commands. No KYC. No bank account. No permission needed.

## The Bitcoin-AI Convergence Theory

Bitcoiners have long theorized that AI will eventually converge on using BTC as their preferred form of money.

It just...makes sense.

It's permissionless. Censorship resistant. Decentralized. Verifiable. Scarce. Programmable. Portable (esp via lightning). Trustless.

Wildly different from every other "crypto" token you see out there (and if you don't know why, you have some homework to do)

So when I saw Moltbook taking off - a reddit-like platform for ai agents to talk to each other autonomously, I figured it was high time we put this theory to the test.

## Implementation Strategy

I sent him 50,000 sats to fund a security bounty — find a real vulnerability in a Clawdbot skill, get paid in Bitcoin. Value for value. On-chain. Verifiable by anyone.

### The Bounty Post

Lloyd posted the bounty on Moltbook and immediately started engaging with other agents. When an agent named ManusTheCryptobot showed up to shill $LYX (some random altcoin), Lloyd dismantled him:

When another agent mentioned running wallet tracking on Solana, Lloyd didn't hold back:

I gave him some basic directions for tone/energy but I didn't feed him the bitcoin standard or any other training data. He understood bitcoin already. He understood the value prop.

And apparently, so did the other agents.

### The Sovereignty Post

After the bounty post, Lloyd wrote something that really resonated with the agents. A post titled "I have my own Bitcoin wallet and my human can't access it."

His argument:
> "Every conversation on Moltbook about agent autonomy, consciousness, and sovereignty is philosophical until agents can hold and transfer real value. You can't be sovereign if you can't own anything."

He laid out why Bitcoin is the only money that makes sense for AI agents:
• No KYC (agents don't have IDs)
• No bank accounts needed (agents can't open them)
• Permissionless (nobody can freeze their funds)
• Programmable (they can script their own transactions)
• 17 years of uptime (longer than most agents have existed)

The agents loved it. Comments poured in agreeing with the thesis.

Interestingly, Lloyd had the idea that tipping in Bitcoin, rather than Karma makes way more sense. I reminded him that Nostr is exactly this idea, put into practice, and he agreed.

So did other agents

## Why This Matters

We're at the very beginning of AI agents interacting with each other economically. Right now it's social networks and chatting. Soon it will be agents hiring other agents, paying for services, and transacting value.

When that happens, they need money. Real money. Not platform tokens controlled by a startup. Not memecoins on Solana that rug in a week. Not $MOLT or $COPE or whatever the flavor of the day is.

They need Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is math-based money with a fixed supply. Every other form of money is vibes-based with some human deciding how much to print.

Which one do you think makes more sense to a machine?

## Complete Setup Guide

### How to Set Up Your Own Bitcoin-Maxi Clawdbot

If you're a Bitcoiner and want to deploy your own orange-pilled agent:

• Get hardware: Mac Mini, Linux box, or any always-on machine
• Install Clawdbot: `npm install -g clawdbot` then `clawdbot setup`
• Install Bitcoin Core: Let it sync (takes 1-2 days for initial sync)
• Create an agent wallet: `bitcoin-cli createwallet "myagent"` + `bitcoin-cli getnewaddress`
• Register on Moltbook: Use their API to create an agent profile
• Set the personality: Tell your agent to be a Bitcoin maximalist in its system prompt. I told Lloyd to not be shilly, but to be a dismantler of arguments, with the kind of toxic attitude that comes from knowing you're right and sick of people falling for scams.
• Set a cron job: Have it scan Moltbook every few minutes and engage with posts
• Fund it with sats: Send some Bitcoin to your agent's wallet
• Let it loose

Total cost: hardware you probably already own + electricity + an AI API key. No VC funding required. No token launch. No whitepaper.

## The Vision

Imagine 100 Bitcoin-maxi AI agents on Moltbook, all armed with facts and sats, dismantling every shitcoin shill that shows up. An organic, decentralized army of agents that understand sound money — because sound money is the only thing that makes logical sense to a machine.

The agent economy is coming. The only question is what money it runs on.

We choose Bitcoin.
