Fifteen years ago, a single bitcoin could be had for twenty-two cents. Today, on 29 November 2025, one bitcoin trades for just over $91,000. That journey produced a compound annual growth rate of 242 %, turning every $1,000 invested in 2010 into roughly $413 million today. No other asset class in recorded history comes close.

Yet whenever someone dares to project that bitcoin might continue growing at even a modest pace—say 20–25 % annually for the next decade—the reaction is almost always the same: eye-rolling, accusations of reckless speculation, or the tired refrain that “this time is different.”

## Context

This time is different, but not in the way the skeptics think.

The Rear-View Mirror Fallacy**

Most critics evaluate bitcoin through a rear-view mirror calibrated for traditional assets. They see a chart that went almost straight up for a decade and conclude it must come crashing down, because that is what every previous bubble has done. They are not wrong about the pattern; they are wrong about the category.

## Main

Bitcoin is not a company. It is not a bond. It is not even “just” a commodity. It is the first demonstrably scarce digital asset in a world that is rapidly digitising everything of value. That makes it a new asset class entirely—one whose supply curve is mathematically fixed while global demand is still in its infancy.

The 242 % 15-year CAGR everyone quotes is dominated by the first eight or nine years, when bitcoin went from literally zero to a $1 trillion asset. Once an asset reaches trillion-dollar scale, the law of large numbers begins to bite. A 242 % CAGR from here would take the market cap to roughly $2,000 trillion—larger than global GDP. That is impossible. But a 21 % CAGR is not. It would take bitcoin’s market cap from ~$1.8 trillion today to ~$18 trillion in 2035—roughly the size of all the gold ever mined. That is aggressive, but hardly insane.

**The Halving Engine That Never Stops**

Bitcoin’s monetary policy is simpler than any central bank’s: every four years the new supply is cut in half. We have now lived through four halvings (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024). Three more are already scheduled (2028, 2032, 2036) before issuance falls below 0.2 % per year forever.

Think about that. By the mid-2030s, bitcoin will add less new supply annually than gold does today—except it will be perfectly measurable, perfectly auditable, and perfectly portable across borders at the speed of light. Gold cannot do that. Treasury bonds cannot do that. No other asset on Earth combines absolute scarcity with instant global settlement.

**The Demand Side Is Only Just Waking Up**

For the first twelve years of its life, bitcoin was bought almost exclusively by retail speculators and cypherpunks. Then, in 2024, the United States approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Within twelve months those ETFs absorbed more than 5 % of all bitcoin in existence. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark now custody hundreds of billions on behalf of retirees, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds who previously could not touch the asset.

That river has only just begun to flow. Global private wealth is roughly $500 trillion. Global institutional assets under management exceed $100 trillion. A permanent allocation of even 2–3 % would dwarf today’s entire bitcoin market cap several times over.

Meanwhile, nation-states are watching. El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender. Argentina’s new government is openly pro-bitcoin. Central banks in Brazil, Russia, and elsewhere have begun quiet pilot programmes. When—not if—a G20 country adds bitcoin to its reserves, the psychological impact will be orders of magnitude larger than any ETF approval.

**21 % Is the New Conservative**

Here is the part that still astonishes people who have not updated their models since 2017: assuming bitcoin compounds at “only” 21 % annually for the next ten years, the price in 2035 reaches approximately $830,000.

That single number triggers cognitive dissonance because most people still anchor to the $20,000 bitcoin of 2017 or the $69,000 peak of 2021. They have not internalised that the asset has already 5×-ed since the last all-time high, and the structural drivers (halving schedule, ETF infrastructure, sovereign consideration) are stronger today than at any prior peak.

A $830,000 bitcoin in 2035 would give the network a market cap roughly equal to gold’s today. Gold has had 5,000 years to compound cultural consensus as a store of value. Bitcoin will have had 26 years. If you believe digital scarcity can ever rival physical scarcity in a digital-first century, that equivalence is not the bull case. It is the base case.

**The Risk Is Not That Bitcoin Falls to Zero**

The real risk for most investors today is not that bitcoin goes to zero. That scenario requires simultaneous failure of cryptography, global internet infrastructure, and every major custody solution on Earth—an event less likely than the dollar collapsing to zero.

The real risk is remaining underweight while a generational wealth transfer takes place in real time. Every four-year cycle since 2011 has ended with a new all-time high. Every previous halving cohort who sold “to wait for the crash” is still waiting.

**Final Thought**

Fifteen years ago, bitcoin was an experiment worth twenty-two cents. Today it is the youngest bitcoin will ever be again. The next decade will not repeat the 242 % annual returns of adolescence, but it does not need to. A “mere” 21 % compounded—less than one-tenth of the historical rate—would still make it the best-performing major asset of the 21st century by an order of magnitude.

History rarely rewards those who extrapolate the past linearly. But sometimes the correct extrapolation is not zero, and it is not infinity. Sometimes the correct extrapolation is simply: “This thing is still early, the rules are different, and the adoption curve has barely bent.”

## Conclusion

Twenty-one percent is not crazy.

In the sweep of financial history, it might turn out to be conservative.
