I used to think inflation was something that happened to other people. You know — Argentinians, Venezuelans, Zimbabweans, those poor souls on the news clutching wheelbarrows of banknotes just to buy bread. I lived in a “stable” country with a “responsible” central bank that solemnly promised to keep inflation around 2 % forever. Two percent sounded harmless. Almost polite.

**Then I did the math. Two percent compounded is a 50 % theft of your money’s purchasing power in twenty-five years. Three percent? You lose two-thirds of it in the same time. Four percent? You’re left with a quarter.**

## Context

That’s not “price stability.” That’s a slow-motion heist with a smiley face sticker on it. One day I ran the numbers on my own savings, my parents’ retirement, the cash I kept in the bank “for emergencies.” I watched the graph curve downward like a guillotine blade and felt something snap. The system wasn’t broken; it was working exactly as designed. And the design was to take from me — quietly, legally, endlessly — and give to those who get the new money first.

That was the moment I finally understood Bitcoin. Not because someone handed me a whitepaper. Not because I watched a YouTube guru scream “to the moon.” But because inflation, that polite little 2 %, had finally mugged me in broad daylight. I was late to the party, but I arrived furious. And I wasn’t alone.

Bitcoin has the most brilliant, ruthless marketing department in history: the global monetary system. Every time a central bank hits “print,” Bitcoin gets free advertising. Every time a currency collapses, Bitcoin gets a new country-sized cohort of believers. Every time a politician promises “just a little more stimulus, just this once,” Bitcoin gets another scar on its ledger that reads: “Never again.” Satoshi didn’t need a Super Bowl ad. He just embedded a headline in the genesis block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”

## Main

That single line has done more to sell Bitcoin than a thousand TED talks. 

Sixteen years later, the flare is still burning.

We were told the post-Covid inflation spike was “transitory.”
Then we were told it was Putin’s fault.
Then we were told it was corporate greed.
Then we were told to stop looking at the data and go buy an EV.

Central banks didn’t just fail to protect your savings. They actively destroyed them, then patted themselves on the back for “soft landing” the economy.

Bitcoin didn’t just survive this period. It thrived.

While the S&P 500 spent 2025 treading water and gold quietly climbed the wall of worry, Bitcoin went from $40k to $117k and back to $91k — still up on the year, still laughing at the people who called it a bubble at $20k, $10k, $5k, $1k, $100, $10…E very dip bought with freshly printed fiat just makes the next leg up more violent.

The Asymmetry That Hurts to Look At

Let me show you something obscene. If you had put $10,000 into:

- 
The U.S. stock market in January 2009 → ~$70,000 today

- 
Gold → ~$28,000 today

- 
A “balanced” 60/40 portfolio → ~$55,000 today

- 
Bitcoin → somewhere north of $300 million today

That’s not a typo.
That’s not leverage.
That’s not a meme stock.

That is what happens when you own the only major asset in human history whose supply cannot be manipulated by a committee in a marble building.

It’s also what happens when the rest of the world slowly realizes their money is melting and sprints toward the other direction.

The beautiful irony? The worse the local fiat gets, the stronger the Bitcoin network effect becomes. It’s a self-reinforcing loop: inflation → capital flight → Bitcoin adoption → stronger network → more inflation resistance → more capital flight. Game theory eating fiat for breakfast.

Here’s the part no one wants to say out loud: Inflation isn’t a bug. It’s the business model. Governments need inflation because they are structurally, mathematically, permanently insolvent. They will never repay their debts in real terms. The only question is how much they can steal from you before you notice.

Bitcoin doesn’t ask for permission.
It doesn’t lobby.
It doesn’t compromise.

It simply refuses to play the game.

21 million.
Verifiable.
Unchangeable.
Forever.

Welcome to the Other Side. If you’re reading this because the latest CPI print made your stomach drop, congratulations. You’ve taken the same journey millions of us did: from comfortable ignorance to cold, furious clarity.

The good news? 

You’re not powerless.
You’re not too late.
You’re not crazy.

You’re just early enough to matter.

The system spent decades training you to fear volatility while it pick-pocketed your future. Now you get to return the favor — by opting out, one satoshi at a time.

Stack sats.
Run a node.
Teach your kids why scarcity actually matters.
Laugh when the next central banker calls Bitcoin “rat poison squared.”

## Conclusion

Because every time they print another trillion, they’re not saving the economy.
They’re sending you another invitation.

See you on the lifeboat.
Somewhere on the Bitcoin standard
