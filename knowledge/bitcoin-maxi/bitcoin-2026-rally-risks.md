# The Death of Bitcoin's 4-Year Cycle: Geopolitics Now Drive Crypto Markets

**Source**: [Bitcoin's 2026 Rally Has One MAJOR Problem! | George Tung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRrAn6lL9vo) - The Wolf Of All Streets  
**Duration**: 41:19 | **Published**: 2026 | **Guest**: George Tung (CryptosRUs)

## Summary

George Tung argues that Bitcoin's traditional 4-year cycle is fundamentally broken, replaced by geopolitical and macro forces as the primary market drivers. Instead of the predictable pattern of 2.5 years crypto winter → slow recovery → parabolic rise, markets now move based on Trump's policies, tariffs, Fed decisions, and global events. The 2025 cycle proved this shift - rather than going parabolic as expected, Bitcoin had steady stair-step growth before topping in October due to geopolitical chaos.

The conversation reveals how serious players have adapted: focusing on Bitcoin and large caps, ignoring leverage-driven chop, and building during uncertain times. Tung shares his pivot from pure crypto analysis to covering macro events, tariffs, and even Greenland acquisitions because "Bitcoin isn't just magically going to go up or down due to the four-year cycle anymore."

## Key Points

• **4-Year Cycle is Dead**: Traditional pattern of crypto winter → recovery → parabolic rise no longer applies; 2025 proved this with steady growth instead of expected parabolic move

• **Geopolitics Drive Everything**: Trump's policies, tariffs, NATO discussions, and global events now determine Bitcoin's direction more than technical cycles or halving events

• **Business Cycle Matters More**: Markets now follow traditional business cycles and liquidity patterns rather than crypto-specific 4-year patterns

• **Exchanges Profit from Chaos**: Leverage liquidations benefit exchanges, not traders; the "scam wicks" and choppiness are designed to liquidate retail positions

• **No Alt Season Occurred**: Traditional cycle markers like alt seasons didn't happen in 2025, further proving the cycle breakdown

• **ETFs Changed the Game**: Institutional products and macro integration fundamentally altered how Bitcoin trades

• **Focus on Big Caps**: Serious players are sticking to Bitcoin and Ethereum rather than chasing smaller altcoins during this uncertain period

• **Prediction Markets Rising**: New financial instruments and betting platforms are gaining traction as traditional metrics become less reliable

• **Content Creators Must Adapt**: Even crypto YouTubers now need to understand tariffs, Fed policy, and geopolitics to provide relevant market analysis

## Notable Quotes

> "The market, it's really driven by geopolitical macro stuff right now. We're really moving away from the four-year cycle from all the metrics that we see."

> "This traditional cycle that we have followed for so many years... I think that cycle that we're all used to is probably gone."

> "The choppiness and these scam wicks that we're seeing is just liquidating people left and right. Who benefits from these liquidations? It's not the traders. It's not the crypto people. It's the exchanges that offer leverage."

> "I just watch Trump... Is that what we've really been reduced to? It's sad but true."

> "You kind of have to have opinion on Greenland now to run a Bitcoin channel, right?"

## Trading/Investment Implications

**Strategic Shifts Required**:

- Traditional cycle-based timing strategies are obsolete
- Macro analysis (Fed policy, geopolitics, business cycles) now essential for crypto positioning
- Leverage trading has become increasingly dangerous due to coordinated liquidation events
- Focus should shift to major cryptocurrencies (BTC/ETH) rather than altcoin speculation

**Risk Management**:

- Avoid high-leverage positions during geopolitically volatile periods
- Expect continued choppiness and "scam wicks" designed to liquidate retail traders
- Traditional support/resistance levels less reliable when political events can override technical analysis

**Opportunity Areas**:

- Prediction markets gaining traction as new financial primitive
- Building during uncertain times positions projects for next liquidity cycle
- Fair-launched community projects (like Tung's Clash token) showing sustainability vs. typical pump-and-dumps

## Action Items

**Monitor Closely**:

- Trump administration policy announcements and their immediate market impact
- Fed meeting outcomes and rate decisions
- Geopolitical developments (tariffs, international relations, economic warfare)
- Business cycle indicators and liquidity conditions

**Research Areas**:

- Prediction market platforms and their growth potential
- Fair-launch token mechanics vs. traditional VC-backed projects
- Correlation between traditional markets and crypto during macro events

**Strategic Positioning**:

- Reduce leverage exposure during politically volatile periods
- Focus portfolio on Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies
- Consider building/accumulating during uncertain times rather than trading volatility
