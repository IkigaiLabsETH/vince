I’m staring at this screen, blocks confirming slow as hell, and thinking back to the nights I’d refresh every five minutes just to make sure my keys were still safe, my nodes syncing, no dust attack or weird UTXO bullshit sneaking in.

You know that feeling... that low hum of paranoia that’s been your constant companion since you first stacked sats back when Bitcoin was four figures and everyone called you crazy.

## Context

And honestly? I sold almost all my self-custodied BTC this past year.

Not rage-quitting like some OGs who got wrecked in ‘22 and swore off the whole thing. Nah, this was cold, calculated. Practical as fuck. Proceeds mostly rolled straight into spot ETFs like IBIT. Yeah, I know, custody with BlackRock feels like handing your sovereignty to the suits we all fled from.

But hear me out.

## Main

Borrowing against self-custodied coins? Been there. Rates were okay with some Swiss outfits, LTVs decent if you jumped through hoops.

> But the paperwork... Jesus. Statements looked like a tax auditor’s wet dream. Friction everywhere. With IBIT through my non-EU brokers? Cleaner lines, better terms, borrow cheap and easy. Less headache, more sleep. I hate admin bullshit. ETFs make the boring parts vanish.

But that wasn’t the only reason. Diversification hit me hard.

For over a decade, I was balls-deep in Bitcoin. Almost everything. It paid off huge—changed my whole life, got me out of the fiat grind, debt-free in a spot where the WiFi mostly works and the ocean’s close enough to drown out the noise.

But it also trapped me. One asset, one narrative.

World spins fast these days.

> AI’s eating everything. You feel it, right? Jobs vanishing, productivity exploding for the ones who own the tools. So I started shifting gains into public equities that scream asymmetric upside.

Tesla first. Wrote about it summer ‘24 when I piled in—shares roughly doubled since then, hitting all-time highs around $485-490 by late December ‘25. Still my biggest equity bag. Elon’s building the future, robots, energy, the works.

I’m a believer.

Then Google this year. Not just the AI dominance—Gemini 3 crushed benchmarks, they’re leading again after some shaky quarters. But quantum too. Willow chip dropped huge breakthroughs in ‘25, verifiable advantage on real physics sims, way ahead of what most realize. Kind of wild, right?

Got skin in nuclear fusion privately—couple companies pushing hard, because if that cracks... energy abundance changes everything. Climate, grids, AI data centers guzzling power like addicts.

We’re barreling toward ugly times. AI’s genius for capital, nightmare for labor. Most folks losing income streams next decade.

Can’t stop it—past the escape velocity.

Governments? Tax bases evaporate as jobs do.

Big state’s days numbered, maybe.

Wealthy stepping in to patch society, or it fractures.

Don’t know.

Gray as hell.

Still max bullish on Bitcoin. It’ll smoke most assets next 10-15 years. But the game’s changed. ETFs in ‘24 pulled it mainstream—can’t unring that bell.

Adapt or fade.

So I keep exposure via the new rails. Redeploy capital where upside’s nuts outside pure BTC. Think impact over dogma.

I’m not alone. Bunch of early guys I know flipped to IBIT post-launch, spread wings into other plays. Practical evolution.

Maybe I’m wrong. Could blow up. But after 13 years dodging cycles, bleeding in bears, stacking when it hurt... this feels right.

## Conclusion

You? Audit your setup. Borrow terms better elsewhere? Diversify without losing the faith? Try one small shift—roll a slice into something wild like quantum or fusion exposure.See you on the other side of whatever ‘26 throws.

Keys or not, stay sovereign.
