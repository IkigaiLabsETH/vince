Charts reloaded for the hundredth time tonight—Bitcoin sitting there at $86K or so on December 18, 2025, down from that October peak of $126K. Feels like yesterday we were toasting the supercycle. Now? Just this quiet ache.
**
Honestly, I should’ve seen it coming. Classic me—getting sucked into the narrative just enough to feel the sting deeper when it unravels. I stacked sats quietly through the Gensler years, watched the election hype build, even allowed myself a rare smirk when Trump signed that Strategic Bitcoin Reserve order back in March. Seized coins, sure, not fresh buys, but still... symbolic win, right? Then the GENIUS Act in July, finally giving stablecoins a real framework. Regulatory clouds parting. Everything lining up.

And yet here we are. Down 30% from the top. Total market cap bleeding from over $3.5 trillion at the peak to scraping $2.9 trillion now. 

## Context

Trillions vaporized in thin holiday air.

Look, I’ve lived through enough of these to know crashes come in flavors. Some are outright fraud—FTX blowing up in ‘22, that contagion ripping 70% off Bitcoin while leverage unwound everywhere. Pure villainy you could point at: SBF in his Bahamas penthouse, the village idiots salivating over yield farms that were just Ponzi wrappers.

Or Luna earlier that year—$60 billion gone overnight in a death spiral. On-chain alchemy failing spectacularly.

## Main

COVID in 2020? Everything tanked 50% in March, crypto included, but we bounced hardest on stimulus waves, new highs by year’s end.

The Gensler hammer from ‘22 to ‘24—suits against everyone, sentiment crushed, but no single explosion. Just slow grind.

Celsius, BlockFi, Three Arrows—leverage blowups in a hiking cycle.

Those hurt. But you could blame clear culprits: fraud, overreach, pandemics, rate hikes. Wait it out, zoom out, survive.

This one? Different animal.**
**
Everything was bullish. Stocks hitting ATHs on AI frenzy—Nasdaq screaming higher most of the year, even if it corrected lately. Gold and silver at records, that inflation hedge story alive. Fed cutting rates early on, global M2 expanding—liquidity flooding risk assets. And a president who’d campaigned on crypto, delivering: Bitcoin Reserve (even if modest), GENIUS Act for stablecoins, friendlier SEC faces, dozens of enforcement cases eased.

Post-election, Bitcoin ripped from around $70k pre-November to $126k in October on pure hype. We all thought this was it—the institutional supercycle. ETFs pouring in billions earlier in the year. Whales accumulating. No more “digital gold” decoupling dreams; it was maturing into a proper asset.

Then... silence on big follow-through. Macro turned.**

Tariff talks resurfacing, trade war fears hitting risk-on plays. 

AI bubble whispers dragging Nasdaq (and crypto’s correlation with it—rolling 30-day often over 0.5 this year, sometimes spiking higher). 

Leveraged positions cascading in low liquidity—billions liquidated. ETF flows reversing hard in Q4, outflows where inflows ruled before. 

Whales taking profits post-peak.

The irony guts me. Crypto finally gets the political blessing, regulatory clarity it begged for... and behaves like just another tech-heavy risk asset. When macro flips risk-off—rate pause signals, tariff uncertainty, valuation fears—crypto doesn’t hedge. It amplifies the drop.

No villain to rage at. Just dashed expectations in the “perfect” setup.

Bet you didn’t expect this either. Remember those old emails from ‘21, me warning about the final parabolic leg before the blow-off? I exited too early then—classic regret. Held longer this cycle, convinced by the policies. Maybe wrong again. Or maybe not.

History whispers these 30-50% drawdowns are bull market tax. 2021 had multiple 50% dips before the last push. Prior cycles saw worse intra-bull corrections—71% in 2011-13 run, 62% in 2018-21.

But psychologically? This stings sharper. We thought we’d escaped the old traps. Institutions in, ETFs legitimizing, government nodding approval. 

And still... the bleed.

Kind of wild, huh? 

Reminds me of those Scion letters—Einhorn dissecting bubbles with surgical calm. Or my own activist days, pouring months into a thesis only for the market to ignore it longer than you can stay solvent.

This year? Not founder-mode grind anymore! 

Just angel stacks and sats. No leverage. 

But watching portfolios shrink as little as 6% YoY still hits the gut, a little bit.

Family asks if it’s “like last time.” I mumble something about cycles, zoom out.

Truth is, no clue what’s next. Macro could stabilize—more cuts if data softens, tariff clarity post-inauguration noise. Policies might still catalyze a 2026 leg. 

Or not.

Bitcoin’s maturing, correlating tighter with Nasdaq (that 0.5+ link held much of 2025). Less “digital gold” hedge, more high-beta tech play.

We’ll see.

For now, coffee’s cold. Charts closed. Dawn coming soon.

Stack what you can afford to lose. 

Read the filings. 

Stay hungry, stay foolish—but quieter these days.

## Conclusion

And if history rhymes... this pain might just be the setup for the next chapter.

We’ll see.
