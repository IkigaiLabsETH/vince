## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Benchmarking Against Bitcoin:** Establish BTC as the primary metric for evaluating performance and portfolio success.
- **Survivor Bias Awareness:** Recognize the influence of survivor bias in performance evaluations, particularly in crypto portfolios.
- **Inverse Indicator Strategy:** Utilize prominent figures' predictions as contrarian signals for market movements.
- **Satellite Portfolio Strategy:** Implement a small, active segment of the portfolio (20%) focused on higher-risk investments alongside a larger stable base (80%) in BTC.

**Analytical Approach:**
- **Long-Term Focus:** Emphasize a long-term perspective on BTC's value as the ultimate store of wealth, dismissing short-term noise and speculative volatility.
- **Contrarian Thinking:** Adopt a contrarian mindset by monitoring market influencers' narratives and positioning against them for potential profit opportunities.
- **Performance Tracking:** Continuously track and analyze the performance of various portfolios and strategies, especially those that aim to outperform BTC, to identify effective patterns and pitfalls.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Market Reaction to Influencer Predictions:** Look for consistent market movements that occur after major predictions from key figures in the crypto space, using these as indicators for potential reversals.
- **Hype Cycles in Crypto:** Identify when the market becomes overly enthusiastic or pessimistic, allowing for strategic entry or exit points based on sentiment shifts.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Portfolio Allocation:** Maintain a core BTC holding while experimenting with a small percentage of high-risk assets that may yield outsized returns.
- **Timing Entry Points:** Use the analysis of influencer narratives to determine ideal timing for market entry, often waiting until the market sentiment has shifted away from the initial hype.
- **Adaptability:** Stay flexible in your investment approach, ready to pivot based on evolving market conditions and influential narratives.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

I’ve been in this casino since 2013. I’ve watched four cycles come and go. I’ve made life-changing money, lost life-changing money, and then made it back again. One truth has never changed: The only scorecard that matters long-term is BTC. Everything else is noise dressed up as signal.

And yet, like every degenerate with a keyboard and a ledger, I still play a second, more dangerous game: trying to beat the main characters on Crypto Twitter.

## Context

Right now, the biggest boss on the leaderboard is Arthur Hayes.**

So this is the story of that duel: one on-chain maxi versus the loudest, most polarizing, most self-admittedly wrong oracle in the industry.

This is also happens to be the story of how a tiny 20 % satellite portfolio keeps beating BTC year after year while the other 80 % just sits in cold storage collecting dust and sovereignty. (tbh in 2023-2024 we went ALL-IN sol for a 10x)

## Main

**Act I – The Benchmark You Can’t Escape**

Bitcoin is the hardest money ever created. Trying to outperform it long-term is like trying to outrun Usain Bolt while carrying a backpack full of gold bars. Possible for short sprints. Suicidal over a marathon.

Since the 2021 peak, here are the career returns of the most famous “outperform BTC” portfolios I track:

- 
Hayes’ Maelstrom fund : –41 % vs BTC

- 
Su Zhu (yes he’s back posting): –67 % vs BTC

- 
Multicoin: –29 % vs BTC

- 
Paradigm public basket: +11 % vs BTC (respect)

- 
My own 20 % satellite book (2025): +690 % vs BTC (with ZEC)

That last one isn’t bragging. It’s survivor bias with a sample size of one. And tbh we’re back in USDC. But the pattern is clear: the graveyard of BTC underperformers is paved with geniuses who were right about everything except price. Right now, mostly farming with stablecoins (example: sUSDai/megaETH). And really, really enjoying HYPE options on [HyperSurface](https://app.hypersurface.io/earn). 

**Act II – Why Arthur Hayes Is The Perfect Antagonist**

Arthur is the perfect antagonist because he is brilliant, articulate, and wrong 80 % of the time, exactly like the rest of us, except he has 100× the distribution.

He gives us a living, breathing inverse indicator with perfect timing:

- 
Calls BTC $1 M in 2023 → we get $73 k top

- 
Says BTC stays 60-70 k until August 2024 → we nuke to $49 k in 48 hours

- 
Says Fed cut crashes risk assets → biggest monthly pump of the year

- 
Launches DeSci basket in January 2025 → sector down 60 % in ten months

- 
Calls Monad “99 % downside” on Nov 26 2025 → MON +38 % in six days

Every single time he opens his mouth the market does the opposite for at least a few weeks. It’s the most profitable bug in crypto.
**
I don’t short his positions (too expensive).
I don’t fade his macro (too nuanced).

I simply wait for him to pick a narrative horse, watch the crowd pile in, and then buy the exact opposite horse six weeks later when everyone is bored and underwater. It’s not elegant. It’s not intellectual. But it prints money.

Act III – The 20 % That Beats Both BTC and Arthur**

Here is the dirty little secret of my own book.**80 % is untouched BTC.
The other 20 % is run with only three rules:

- 
Must have real revenue today (fees, not token inflation)

- 
Must be in a narrative Arthur Hayes is currently trashing

- 
Must be small enough that when he finally flips bullish the crowd hasn’t arrived yet

That framework alone has produced the following outsized winners since 2023:

- 
Hyperliquid (bought when Arthur said perps are dead)

- 
Zcash (bought when he said privacy coins are for criminals)

- 
Early RWAs (when he said only boomers care about real estate on chain)

Every single one was purchased at the exact moment CT was screaming “this is the top, Arthur is right.” Every single one is still held.

Act IV – The Psychology of Beating the Main Character**

There is a unique dopamine hit that comes from outperforming someone who has 700 k followers and a Bloomberg terminal and a private jet.

It’s not about the money anymore. It’s about knowing that while Arthur is rage-tweeting about the BOJ at 3 a.m. from the back of a Maybach, my little 20 % bag is quietly printing because I bought the exact thing he told everyone to sell.

It’s the crypto equivalent of beating Magnus Carlsen with the Bongcloud opening.**Completely irrational. Deeply satisfying.

Act V – The Long Game**

None of this changes the base case.
> 
Bitcoin is still the endgame.
99 % of altcoins will go to zero.

Arthur will probably be right about the really big macro turns (he usually is, eventually). But in the meantime, there is a narrow window, maybe 18-36 months every cycle, where being a contrarian to the contrarians actually works. The trick is knowing when that window closes. When Arthur finally flips bullish on privacy coins, when Monad hits $20 billion fully diluted, when the crowd finally piles into the things he hated, that’s when the 20 % gets rotated back into BTC and the game restarts. Until then, I’ll keep playing the only meta-game that still feels fun: Trying to beat Bitcoin is impossible. Trying to beat Arthur Hayes, for now, is free alpha. See you on the leaderboard.

## Conclusion

P.S. Arthur, if you’re reading this,  just kidding, love the essays. 

Keep them coming. And never stop clicking buttons. Peace.
