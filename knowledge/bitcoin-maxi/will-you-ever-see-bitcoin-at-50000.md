High above the clouds, Bitcoin trades at $92,400.
> 
The $126,000 peak from four weeks ago already belongs to another era. Euphoria has soured into the familiar iron taste of correction, leverage has been wrung out, weak hands shaken off, timelines filled again with the old liturgy: “It’s over,” “This time is different,” “I sold the bottom in 2022 and I swear I’ll sell the top this cycle too.”

I have read these obituaries before, in 2018, in 2022, in every post-halving valley of despair, and every single time the asset has come back, battered, ridiculed, pronounced dead more often than any invention in history, only to climb higher than its wildest believers once dreamed possible.

So let us speak plainly, without the chest-thumping that poisons most crypto commentary, and confront the two questions now tormenting everyone who watched the train leave the station above $100,000.

Will Bitcoin ever trade near $50,000 again before 2026 is out?

Will $150,000 feel laughably cheap by 2028?

The answers, built from cycle history, on-chain evidence, institutional flows, and the merciless math of shrinking supply, are more nuanced than maximalists like and far more optimistic than skeptics can bear.

## The cycle parable

Every Bitcoin cycle tells the same parable, only the numbers grow.

2012 halving, 2013 mania, 2014-2015 winter, down 85%.

2016 halving, 2017 mania, 2018-2019 winter, down 84%.

2020 halving, 2021 mania, 2022 winter, down 77%.

2024 halving, 2025 mania, 2026-2027 winter, question mark.

The drawdowns remain savage, yet they shallow with age. The asset is maturing. Retail panic now lands in hands that do not sell the way a twenty-two-year-old leverage junkie once did.

Maturity is not immunity, however. Crashes will still arrive, just less biblical each turn.

If this bull peaks between $150,000 and $250,000, a range that captures nearly every credible model from Stock-to-Flow to power-law bands, a classic 80% retracement points to $30,000-$50,000.

Yes, $50,000 remains possible.

The bear case is not fantasy.

## The bear case

Picture Q1 2026: parabolic blow-off past $200,000, ETF inflows of $1-2 billion a week flip to $500 million weekly outflows, miners capitulate early because difficulty never caught up, the Fed hikes again to crush sticky inflation, risk assets bleed together. Then Q2-Q3 bring the true bear: short-term holder realized price collapses below $70,000, tax-loss harvesting avalanches begin, Coinbase premium stays negative for months, exchange balances explode as the 2021 tourists vomit coins onto the bid stack.

By November 2026, Bitcoin kisses $48,000.

I have watched this film three times. 

The dialogue barely changes, only the price scale does.

## The bull case

Now the bull case against ever seeing $50,000 again, and it is not hopium.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs swallowed over one million coins in 2025 alone, roughly 5% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark do not panic-sell for their pension funds and sovereign clients who cannot spell HODL yet must meet allocation targets.

The supply shock is live. Daily issuance sits under 450 BTC while ETFs routinely vacuum 5,000-10,000 on green days. Floating supply is vanishing in real time.

Most critically, the political weather has flipped. The United States, whether under Trump or bipartisan survival instinct, now treats Bitcoin as potential strategic reserve. When nations hoard rather than strangle, the floor becomes geopolitical, not emotional.

A 70% drop from $200,000 lands at $60,000. An 80% drop, the historical norm, would demand capitulation unseen since 2018, back when almost nobody outside crypto Twitter knew the word Bitcoin.

That world is gone forever.

My synthesized probability for the 2026-2027 bear low, after digesting dozens of models, on-chain liquidity, ETF flow forecasts, and the power-law trend that has ruled since 2011:

Above $90,000: 15%

$70,000-$90,000: 35% (most probable bucket)

$50,000-$70,000: 30%

$30,000-$50,000: 15%

Below $30,000: 5%

Translation: you may indeed get one last chance under $50,000 before Bitcoin escapes retail reach permanently, but the median future now points to the highest floor in history.

## The long view

Fast-forward to 2028.

The halving will cut issuance to roughly 225 coins per day. Global ETF vaults will hold three to four million BTC. Nation-state stacks, American reserve, German funds, smaller countries copying El Salvador, will be measured in hundreds of thousands, not thousands.

The same power-law corridor that has guided price for fifteen years with spooky accuracy projects $400,000 to $1,200,000 by late 2028 or early 2029.

One hundred and fifty thousand dollars will not simply be surpassed, it will be remembered the way we now remember $1,000 in 2020, with stunned laughter at how inexpensive freedom once was.

## Conclusion

To the future you, reading this in the 2026-2027 darkness, sweat on your skin as the chart grinds lower week after week, remember:

You have walked this valley before.

The faithful were mocked before.

The asset has been declared dead 478 times and counting.

Every cycle births fresh reasons why “this time the top is eternal,” and every cycle the protocol, unmoved, uncaring, unstoppable, keeps halving, keeps hardening, keeps accruing value.

Buy the fear if your hands are steady.

Hold the storm if that is all you can do.

But never doubt the destination.

Long after the leverage is ashes, after the tourists have scattered, after headlines chase the next shiny toy, exactly 21 million coins will remain.

The last person who truly grasps what that scarcity means will pay a price so absurd that today’s debates about $50,000 or $150,000 will feel like cave art.

See you on the other side.
