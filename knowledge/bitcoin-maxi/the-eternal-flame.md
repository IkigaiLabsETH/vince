Bitcoin sits around $88,000—down from its autumn peaks near $125,000, yet holding firm. Ethereum lingers near $3,000, a shadow of its earlier highs above $4,900.The market feels weary. Total crypto capitalization hovers just under $3 trillion, after brushing $4 trillion not long ago. Headlines whisper of bears and capitulation. But I’ve seen this before. Cycles turn. Hype fades. What remains is what was built to last.

The Eternal Struggle for Power**

## Context

Politics, as the Machiavellians taught us, is no fairy tale. It’s the raw contest between elites and masses, an iron law of oligarchy where power circulates but never truly democratizes. Burnham saw it clearly: societies evolve toward managerial control—technocrats, administrators, bureaucrats rising to dominate, whether under capitalism, socialism, or something new.

Crypto mirrors this.

Bitcoin is no utopia. 

## Main

It’s a realist’s creation. 

Scarce. Immutable. 

No central promises of endless innovation or world-changing utility. 

Just 21 million coins, a fixed rule in a world of fiat manipulation. 

It doesn’t pretend to solve everything. 

It defends one thing fiercely: sound money.

**Ethereum? Ambitious. Complex. **

A sprawling bureaucracy of smart contracts, Layer 2s, staking committees, and perpetual upgrades. Fusaka landed earlier this month, promising cheaper transactions and more blobs. It delivered technically. But the price yawned.

Upgrades are the managerial class at work—endless tweaks to a machine that grows ever more intricate, ever more dependent on experts.

**The Ancient Flame**

Fustel de Coulanges showed how ancient societies rested on sacred foundations. The family hearth, ancestor worship—these religious beliefs shaped laws, property, hierarchy. The city-state emerged from domestic cults, stable because rooted in something timeless, unquestioned.

Bitcoin feels like that hearth.

Its “religion” is simple: proof-of-work (now echoed in proof-of-stake scarcity post-halving), the halving ritual, the gospel of HODL. No grand promises of rewriting society. Just digital property, inheritable, sacred in its fixity.

Institutions treat it as such. Spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in over $25 billion this year—despite Bitcoin’s modest gains or even dips. BlackRock’s IBIT ranks among top inflows, ahead of many roaring equity funds. They allocate quietly, patiently. Not trading hype, but preserving value.
**
Ethereum’s ecosystem? More like the modern managerial state—efficient in parts, bloated in others, forever reforming itself.

Mass Movements and True Believers**

Hoffer warned us about fanaticism. Mass movements attract the frustrated, offering collective purpose through sacrifice and radical change. Ideologies swap masks—communism, nationalism, revolution—but the psychology endures.

Crypto has its true believers.

In bull runs, Ethereum’s vision ignites them: the world computer, DeFi revolution, tokenizing everything. Yield farms bloom. Memecoins launch. Narratives promise transcendence.

When winter comes—as it has now—the movement fractures. 

On-chain activity cools. Gas fees plummet not from triumphant scaling, but absent demand. ETH/BTC ratio scrapes multi-year lows around 0.034. Spot ETH ETFs see sporadic outflows, persistent compared to Bitcoin’s steady inflows.

**The frustrated scatter. **

Some double down in hatred of “maximalists.” Others quietly exit.

Bitcoin asks less belief. It just... is.A New Civilization Emerging

Maçães argues America isn’t declining—it’s transforming into something distinct, blending reality with myth, entertainment with empire. 

**Post-truth, post-liberal, forging a new identity.**

Bitcoin embodies a similar shift in money.

Not European-style central banking restraint. Not utopian smart-contract dreams. A raw, imperial hardness—digital gold for a world of debasement, geopolitics, treasury reserves.

Nation-states eye it. Corporations stack it. ETFs institutionalize it.

Ethereum promises a new liberal order: programmable, inclusive, endlessly upgradable. But in risk-off seasons, hardness wins.

**The Arithmetic Remains Brutal**

Simple math.

Bitcoin’s new supply: ~450 coins daily post-halving. 

At $88,000, roughly $40 million sell pressure.

Counter it: ETF inflows averaging hundreds of millions on good days. 

Corporates accumulating. Supply shock builds slowly, inexorably.
**
Ethereum: Near-zero issuance, sometimes deflationary. Staking yields decent. But unlimited cap. Demand tied to utility—and utility tied to speculation.

In fear, preservation trumps promises.

Bitcoin market cap: ~$1.75 trillion. Gold: $16 trillion. Room to grow.

Ethereum: ~$360 billion. Needs sustained growth narratives to catch up.

Critiquing the Delusions**

I’m optimistic long-term on crypto. Blockchain endures.

Bitcoin could push $150,000+ if flows accelerate and macros cooperate. Longer horizon: matching gold’s cap isn’t absurd.

Ethereum has real strengths—tokenized assets, mature DeFi, Layer 2 ecosystems. If real-world utility compounds, $5,000–$8,000 plausible.

But hype is dangerous. Hoffer’s true believers chase the next upgrade as salvation. Managerial tinkering assumes complexity scales forever.

Reality: Power concentrates. Scarcity endures. Sacred things outlast machines.

**What I Hold**

Disclosure: Heavy Bitcoin allocation.Not anti-Ethereum. But asymmetry favors the hearth over the bureaucracy in uncertain times.

Bitcoin wins inflation. Wins deflation. Wins chaos.

Ethereum needs perpetual motion—growth, risk-on, flawless execution.

**The Quiet Endurance**

Markets will thaw. Narratives reborn. Ethereum may shine again in 2026.

But Bitcoin doesn’t chase seasons. It burns steady, like the ancient flame.

In a world of managerial revolutions and fleeting mass fervor, that’s enough.

## Conclusion

Stay clear-eyed. Think cycles. Reject delusions.

Winter tests foundations.
