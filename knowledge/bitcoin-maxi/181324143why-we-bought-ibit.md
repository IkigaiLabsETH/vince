## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Self-Custody vs. Institutional Custody**: Distinguishing between maintaining control of one’s assets versus relying on third-party custodians.
- **Risk Management**: Evaluating and prioritizing various types of risks, particularly personal safety and asset security.
- **Market Sentiment and Personal Choice**: Understanding how external events influence individual decision-making in the crypto space.
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Flexibility in investment strategies based on changing circumstances and risks.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Approach the topic of cryptocurrency investment by assessing the balance between personal security and asset control. Recognize that while self-custody is a fundamental principle for many in the crypto community, personal safety concerns may necessitate the acceptance of institutional solutions. Evaluate the trade-offs involved in these choices and how they impact risk exposure.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for patterns of increasing regulatory scrutiny and personal risk factors in regions with high-profile incidents involving crypto holders. Monitor news cycles for emerging threats that may indicate a shift in the safety landscape of cryptocurrency ownership. Recognize that societal trends, such as rising crime rates related to crypto, may prompt shifts in investor behavior.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Develop a strategy that includes the following steps:
  1. **Risk Assessment**: Continuously evaluate personal and market risks associated with different custody options.
  2. **Diversification**: Consider diversifying holdings between self-custody and institutional custody to mitigate risks.
  3. **Scenario Planning**: Prepare for potential adverse scenarios, including regulatory changes or personal safety threats, and devise contingency plans.
  4. **Stay Informed**: Regularly update knowledge on market conditions, regulatory changes, and personal safety trends to inform decision-making.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, prioritizing frameworks and analytical approaches over specific metrics or historical data.
- Apply a mindset that is adaptable to changing external conditions while remaining rooted in core investment principles.
- Ensure actionable insights are relevant to current and evolving situations in the crypto landscape.

I’m staring at a push notification that just says “Another French crypto guy lost two fingers.” Again. And something in my chest just… snaps. Not dramatic, not cinematic. Just this quiet, exhausted “fuck it.”

Look, I’ve been holding my own keys since 2013. Back when Mt. Gox was still a running joke and “cold storage” sounded badass instead of suicidal. 

## Context

“Not your keys, not your coins, plebs.” Yeah, real cute until the masked guys with bolt cutters show up at your kid’s preschool. France, man. France went full horror movie this year. Ledger’s own co-founder gets his finger sawed off on camera because some animals wanted a ransom in Bitcoin. Then it’s the Paymium CEO’s pregnant daughter dragged into a van in the 16th arrondissement. Then some poor bastard in Vienne literally burned alive. Thirty-three reported wrench attacks in one country in one year. Six of them left people missing digits. And that’s just the ones we heard about.

And the punchline? The French state basically handed the criminals the guest list. Two million taxpayers’ data dumped on the dark web for three grand. Some tax clerk in Seine-Saint-Denis selling addresses to gangs for €800 a pop. And now — cherry on this shit sundae — they’re forcing anyone with more than five grand in a self-custody wallet to register the damn addresses with the tax man. Congratulations, here’s your neon “ROB ME” sign, courtesy of the Republic.
> 
I held out longer than I should have. Kept telling myself “institutional custody is for boomers who still think Satoshi is a type of sushi.” 

Then one night I’m doomscrolling and see a video — blurred, thank god — of a guy I used to chat with on Crypto Twitter begging while they hold a blowtorch to his hand. And I just… closed the laptop, opened Fidelity, and bought a disgusting amount of IBIT before the market opened.

## Main

Feels dirty admitting it. Like I defected. Like I put on the suit and sold out to BlackRock of all people. But here’s the thing: nobody’s kicking in Larry Fink’s door for his seed phrase. The coins sit in Coinbase Custody, multisig, insured, offline, audited until they’re bored. My “keys” are now a line item in a brokerage account that’s SIPC-protected and impossible to link to my home address without a court order. I sleep with both hands, guys. Both of them.

I’m not saying ETFs are the revolution. I’m saying revolutions don’t mean much when you’re bleeding on the kitchen tile. The purists can scream “not your keys, not your coins” all they want from whatever country hasn’t made self-custody a giant target yet. I’ll be over here paying BlackRock twenty-five basis points a year to not get tortured.

Could still get wrecked plenty of other ways, sure. SEC could go full Gensler. ETFs could get rug-pulled by some black-swan custody failure. I’m not dumb. But the specific flavor of risk that involves pliers and my fingernails? That one’s off the table now. And honestly? That feels like winning.

So yeah. The Ledger’s in a trash next to some old Trezor I never even unsealed. Might fish it out one day when the world chills the hell out. Until then, I’m just another IBIT bagholder refreshing the price at 3 a.m. like a normie.

If you’re still self-custody maxxing in 2025 France — or anywhere the kidnappings are spreading — I’m not gonna yell at you. Just… maybe open a brokerage tab next to your cold-wallet tab. Move ten percent over. See how it feels to wake up without scanning the local news for “finger” and “crypto” in the same sentence.

Tell me if you sleep better. Or if I’m just getting old and scared.

Either way, I still have all ten fingers. For now, that’s enough.

Part II: Wait, Whose Fault Is This Exactly? 

Are we suing Ledger? Should we? Short answer: If your mailing address ended up in that 2020 Shopify hack of theirs and you’ve been getting death-threat postcards ever since, yeah, go join whatever class-action carcass is still twitching in California or Paris. They fucked up, they paid a fine, they settled with some people, and they still get to sell $300 metal sticks to newbies who think “air-gapped” means the bad guys can’t find their apartment building. 

That breach was real, it was ugly, and it definitely made life spicier for a lot of European holders who later got very unwelcome visitors.

But here’s where I’m gonna piss off the pitchfork crowd: that old leak is not the smoking gun for the 2025 finger-chopping festival. The kidnappings that finally broke me? Those were turbocharged by two million French taxpayers’ home addresses getting sold for the price of a PlayStation on the dark web, plus some civil servant in Seine-Saint-Denis who thought organized crime needed a loyalty card. Ledger’s name isn’t on those spreadsheets. The tax authority’s is. 

The random defiscalization sites that got popped are. The state that can’t keep its own citizens’ data locked down is.

I swear, blaming Ledger for the whole mess is like blaming the safe manufacturer because the bank printed everyone’s safe combination on the quarterly newsletter.

Don’t get me wrong; Ledger’s spent years puffing their chest about “be your own bank” while quietly knowing that “your own bank” comes with a side of “hope you have a panic room.” They could’ve screamed louder about opsec, doxxing risks, fake delivery guys, all of it. They didn’t. They sold recovery-seed engraving kits instead. That’s… gross. But legally actionable for what happened to David Balland or the poor bastard who got torched in Vienne? I’m not your lawyer (thank god), but the causation chain is longer than a Solana outage.

The real villains are the ones who turned public blockchains plus shitty data hygiene into a treasure map with your front door circled in red. That’s a collective failure: lazy regulators, greedy startups that collected KYC like Pokémon cards, and yeah, a hardware company that leaned way too hard into the “sovereignty” marketing when sovereignty apparently now requires a private security detail and a fake name on the doorbell.

So no, I’m not lighting candles for Ledger. But I’m also not wasting my one wild and precious life trying to bankrupt a French wallet company while the actual crooks are out on bail laughing in some Marseille villa.

I already did the only thing that actually moved the needle for me: I stopped being a juicy target. Coins in a brokerage account, address unlinked, no seed phrase for anyone to carve out of me. Call it surrender, call it growing up, call it whatever keeps you warm at night.

If you’re still mad and want blood, go yell at the French tax authority. They’re the ones who actually handed out the guest list.

Me? I’m going to bed. With both hands. And the Ledger stays in the drawer, gathering dust next to my principles.

Part III will probably be me admitting I bought some MicroStrategy calls. Don’t judge me until you’ve read the local news in Paris lately.

Part IV: How the French Tax Man Made Me His Bitch

I woke up hungover from righteous indignation, hit the Fidelity app, and dumped our self-custodied Bitcoin into IBIT like a coward who just wants to live.

Thirty seconds later, the real kidnapping happened.

Not the balaclava kind. The polite, bureaucratic, state-sanctioned kind.

France decided that converting my evil, freedom-loving, hardware-wallet Bitcoin into boring, regulated, BlackRock-custodied shares was a “disposal event.” Translation: I owed them 30% flat tax (the infamous PFU, prélèvement forfaitaire unique) on every single euro of unrealized gain I’d been sitting on since 2017. Plus social charges if you’re over a certain threshold, because why not kick me in the teeth while I’m already bleeding.

I stared at the tax simulator like it was a ransom note: “Transfer monies to the Direction Générale des Finances Publiques or we seize your bank account, loser.”

Look, I knew this rule existed. I just lived in the comfortable delusion that I’d never be dumb enough to trigger it. Turns out getting terrified for your fingerprints makes you real dumb, real fast.

So there I was, paying the same state that leaked two million addresses and forced everyone to register their wallets, thirty goddamn percent for the privilege of not having my door kicked in at 3 a.m. That’s not a tax, that’s a protection racket with better branding than the Corsican mafia.

The cherry? If I’d kept the coins in the Ledger another year, paid zero capital gains (because no disposal), and just… you know, prayed nobody sawed my hand off, I’d still have the full stack. Instead I paid Paris to let me sleep without a baseball bat under the pillow.

I laughed. Then I cried. 

Then I sent the wire before the market opened because apparently I’m now the exact kind of spineless boomer I used to roast on CT in 2019.

Moral of the story: In France 2025, the house always wins. Either the gang with the pliers gets your coins, or the tax office gets 30% of them for the crime of wanting to keep your extremities attached.

## Conclusion

Next time someone tells you “just move to Portugal or Dubai, bro,” remember it still costs you a third of your stack to escape the country that turned self-custody into an extreme sport.

Liberté, égalité, give me a fucking break.
