Alright, confession time: I spent the better part of this morning poring over every pixel of tbso.com. Not a skim— a full immersion. If you’re like me, chasing that elusive “exit ramp” from the grind, this site isn’t just a landing page. It’s a manifesto disguised as a corporate homepage. A quiet signal fire for the untouchables. Let me unpack it raw, no fluff, because if Eric Larchevêque and crew are building what I think they are, this is your cheat code update.

**The Vibe Check: Foggy Monoliths and Hayek Vibes**

## Context

First, the aesthetics hit like a cold plunge—fog-shrouded stone pillars etched with “libertas per dominium” (freedom through dominion, for the Latin-averse), a glowing dolmen that screams ancient ritual meets cypherpunk future, and a pixelated world map in emerald green dots, like a constellation of opt-in rebels.

This isn’t hype; it’s infrastructure. They’re building an “ecosystem” where your wealth, businesses, and networks compound into collective muscle—enough to whisper (or shout) in economic and regulatory rooms.

**The Three Pillars: Your Blueprint for the Network State**

## Main

This is where the site sings. TBSO’s vision distills into three interlocking moves—straight out of the Ikigai playbook for anti-fragile living:

- Pillar I: A Civilizational Asset\*\*Bitcoin as the untouchable vault. Scarce (21M cap), incorruptible (bye, fiat debasement), transparent (every tx on chain), borderless (sovereignty ignores maps). They quote Hayek: “We have to take money out of the hands of governments...” It’s your personal Fort Knox, but communal. Stack sats here, and you’re not just HODLing—you’re funding a freer world.

- Pillar II: A Global Community
  The real territory? People. Thousands of high-caliber opt-ins—builders who choose this over cubicles. No coercion, just alignment. It’s the van tribe, globalized: mutual rocket fuel for launches, deals, and moonshots. If you’re ghosting the 9-5, this is your crew—high-trust, value-creating, zero drama.

- Pillar III: An Emerging Economic Force
  Aggregate power to bend arcs. Public listing means market cap as jujitsu—whispers become policy. Influence debates without begging.

The Big Picture: This Is Act I\*\*

Diving into TBSO’s site crystallized it: This isn’t a “Bitcoin club for rich dudes.” Eric’s keynote? Just the flare. The site’s the map: BTC as base layer, community as territory, cap as leverage. In a world of tax traps and surveillance swells, it’s the ark for the productive ghosting out.

**TBSO’s Ticker: Still TAYN (For Now) – The Euronext Pivot**

It’s a phoenix rising from the ashes of a dusty shell company. Eric Larchevêque and crew scooped up 98% of Société de Tayninh – an old Euronext Paris relic (ISIN: FR0000063307) – for peanuts (OPA at €0.11/share, total buyout ~€500K).

They flipped it into The Bitcoin Society overnight, but the ticker? It’s holding steady at TAYN on Euronext Paris.

The catch: Trading’s suspended right now (post-announcement halt for the transformation drama), and a full ticker swap to something TBSO-flavored (maybe “TBSO.PA”?) is teased for the future – pending a dedicated press drop and regulatory nod. Think of it as Act I paperwork: The shell’s legal husk keeps the lights on while they stack sats and build the network society.

How to Trade It Early? Fire up a broker. Search “TAYN” – once it resumes (eyes on January 2026 EGM for catalysts), you’re in. Low float means volatility porn, so size small. No pink sheets or OTC yet; this is pure Euronext.

Most Bitcoin treasury companies (DATs) are absolutely wrecked in 2025:

- 60–98% drawdowns (Nakamoto –98%, Metaplanet –67%, ..)

- Premiums flipped to discounts (many now <1x mNAV)

- Dilution via endless PIPE/ATM raises killed the “infinite glitch”

- ETFs stole the easy beta, index funds threaten to dump, …

## Conclusion

Result: 80%+ of the 140+ public DATs are underwater and corporate BTC buying has collapsed from 1,400 BTC/day to almost zero.

While the old guard bleeds, TBSO is the new, antifragile prototype quietly launching at the exact bottom of the DAT sentiment cycle. Translation: Maybe the Nakamoto-style disasters just handed you the cheapest, cleanest Bitcoin-sovereignty bet in Europe.
