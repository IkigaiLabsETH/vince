## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Asset vs. Liability:** Understanding the distinction between investments that generate wealth (e.g., Bitcoin) versus those that may appear valuable but incur significant costs (e.g., real estate).
- **Opportunity Cost:** Evaluating the potential returns from alternative investments when allocating financial resources.
- **Fixed Supply and Scarcity:** Recognizing the implications of Bitcoin’s finite supply on its value proposition compared to traditional assets like real estate.
- **Forced Savings vs. Investment Growth:** Analyzing the effectiveness of forced savings methods (e.g., mortgage payments) against actively managed investments.

**Analytical Approach:**
- **Comparative Analysis:** Regularly assess the performance of different asset classes through a lens of total cost versus return. This includes not just direct financial outcomes but also lifestyle impacts and long-term wealth generation.
- **Scenario Simulation:** Run hypothetical scenarios (e.g., Path A vs. Path B) to visualize potential outcomes based on different financial decisions, focusing on long-term growth and liquidity rather than immediate gratification.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Market Trends:** Monitor the price-to-income ratios in target areas to identify unsustainable market conditions that may indicate a bubble.
- **Investment Timing:** Look for historical periods where emerging technologies or assets (like Bitcoin) have provided outsized returns compared to traditional investments (like real estate) during similar economic climates.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Investment Diversification:** Formulate a strategy that incorporates a mix of high-growth assets (e.g., cryptocurrencies) and stable investments (e.g., bonds) to balance risk and reward.
- **Long-term Vision:** Prioritize investments that align with personal financial goals, considering both lifestyle aspirations and wealth accumulation. Avoid being anchored to traditional asset classes that may not serve future financial objectives.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

I was the poster child for the old playbook. At 18 I bought a shitty beach-front studio in Europe with 100 % financing because it was literally the only thing I could afford. For the next 20 years I grinded: every spare euro went into that mortgage, into renovations, into property taxes, into the endless surprise bills that come with salt air and concrete cancer. I told myself it was “forced savings” and that owning something on the ocean would one day make me rich.

Fast-forward two decades. The flat is paid off. I swapped it for a renovator’s house down south and threw another five figures at a beach-front plot on the best left point-break in Central America. 

## Context

Lifestyle score: 10/10. 

Financial score? Laughable.

When I actually sat down and ran the numbers (all the interest paid, all the notary fees, all the capital-gains tax when I sold, all the renovation overruns, all the years I couldn’t sell because “the market was bad”) the real return was worse than just buying Apple, Amazon, Google and Tesla back when they were still controversial.

## Main

Real estate didn’t make me wealthy. It just made the bank wealthy and taught me the world’s most expensive financial lesson: bricks are a lifestyle choice disguised as an investment.

Then I discovered Bitcoin.

And I never looked back.

**The 2025 Housing Reality Check**

Median existing-home price in the U.S. right now: $415,200.**Median first-time buyer age: 40 (also a new all-time high).
National price-to-income ratio: 5.0× and climbing.

In the places surfers, digital nomads and anyone under 40 actually want to live? Try 8–12× income. That’s not a market. That’s a moat with a “For Sale” sign on it.

My Personal Math of Regret

- 
20-year mortgage @ average 4.2 % on the original flat → ~€240k in interest 

- 
Renovations, taxes, insurance, community fees → another €180k+

- 
Opportunity cost of the money that went into the mortgage instead of MAG7 stocks or Bitcoin → easily north of €1.5M today

Net result? 

I own some nice memories and a paid-off flat that kept pace with inflation… barely. Meanwhile the kid who rented a room, lived on rice and put €500 a month into Bitcoin starting in 2013 is quietly looking at eight-figure net worth.

The Orange-Pill Moment**

The second I actually understood Bitcoin’s fixed supply and verifiable scarcity, real estate stopped looking like an asset and started looking like a very pretty, very expensive liability.

I still love the idea of building my dream surf house on that point-break plot. But I also love not being poor at 65 more.

**Run Your Own Numbers**

You, age 30, €90k gross household income, saving €1,000 a month.

Path A – The one I took (mortgage + renovations + “forced savings”)

After 8–10 years of grinding you finally own something worth €600–800k… that cost you €400k in interest + taxes + surprises and 10 years you’ll never get back. Real after-cost, after-inflation return: 2–4 % if you’re lucky.

Path B – The one I wish 2013-me knew about

€500 into 5 % yield (T-bills, whatever)**€500 DCA into Bitcoin at a very conservative 21 % CAGR
→ After 8 years you have ~€215k liquid, no leaks, no tenants, no 3 a.m. plumbing calls. Buy the same house cash, or a better one, at age 36 instead of 46.

That’s an entire decade of your life bought back.

The Crux Nobody Wants to Admit**

Real estate was the greatest middle-class wealth transfer mechanism of the 20th century. Bitcoin is shaping up to be the same for the 21st — except this time the entry ticket is $10, not a 20 % down-payment and perfect credit.

If Bitcoin goes to zero, the escape hatch closes and we’re all locked into landlord feudalism forever. If Bitcoin succeeds, houses slowly get demonetised because young people stop panic-bidding on 50-year-old bungalots when they can compound at 20–40 % in something that fits on a hardware wallet.

Guess which future keeps society stable.

**Final Thought From a Former Real-Estate Maxi**

I still surf. I still dream about that little off-grid surf compound. But I’ll build it with stacked sats, not with another 25-year debt sentence.

## Conclusion

The people still screaming “just buy a house, it’s always been the best investment” are the same people who bought at 2.5× income in 1998 and never ran the real numbers. Don’t be me for 20 years. Be the version of me who finally got it. Stack sats. Live near the waves anyway. But own your time first.

Because the most expensive house in the world is the one that owns you.
