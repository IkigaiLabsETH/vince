Bitcoin sits around $88k, down 30% from that October spike to $126k. Feels like a gut-punch reset, right? You know the one – euphoria peaks, then macros flip, leverage cascades, and suddenly everyone’s a bear again.

We’ve chased it before. ‘18 bloodbath, ‘22 cascades... hell, even ‘24’s ETF surge had us thinking this time was different. Kind of was. Kind of wasn’t.

## Context

This year wasn’t the supercycle moonshot the degens prayed for.

No $200k, no endless altseason.

BTC started the year near $95k, roared to $126k on ETF mania and safe-haven vibes amid equity wobbles and geo-tensions, then... poof.

## Main

Deleveraging hit hard. Outflows kicked in late, BlackRock’s IBIT alone bled billions in streaks. Price stabilized in the low 90s, dipped to high 80s.

YTD? Flat to negative for many who timed wrong.

But zoom out: institutions poured $30-34 billion net into spot ETFs, even as returns went red. That’s wild, right? Buying the dip in a “bad” year – imagine what happens in a good one.

Dominance tells the story better than price. BTC.D crept up to near 60%, highest in years. Alts bled relative, L1s underperformed hard – SOL down sharp, ETH lagging. Why? Equities decoupled, yields climbed (10Y around 4.2-4.8%), DXY held firm, gold stole the hedge spotlight with monster gains.

Risk-off flows favored the king.

Perps funding stayed mildly positive but OI dropped on liquidations, options IV cooled after expiry bombs. Onchain? Hash rate grinded higher, active addresses steady, but TVL in DeFi flatlined around $118b – no explosion, just survival.

Fear & Greed hugged extreme fear in December, alt season index tanked to teens.

**Yearly Cycles: The Halving Echo That Faded**

Post-halving years are supposed to pump hard. 2025? The aftershock came, but muted. Early inflows steady, price higher lows into summer. Then Q4 rebalances, tax harvesting, thin liquidity – classic end-of-year rug vibes.

**Hedge the Vol, Hunt the Upside**

Maybe wrong – arithmetic rhymes, but demand could lag if equities vol spills harder. Could rug deeper if macro ghosts linger. But data whispers: liquidity flows eventual, institutions not done (cumulative inflows still massive), dominance probabilistic 65%+ if risk-off persists.

Wheel options yields ahead – breakevens favor longs on dips. Prob 70% BTC reclaims $120k+ in 2026, dom >60%. Hedge equities correlation traps.

Long hard assets, short the froth. Eyes wide, stacking quietly.

BTC as freedom’s protocol – escaped the fiat grind again this year, accidental wins in sovereignty. Not advice – rug at your own risk.

Ride the absurdity with your people.

## Conclusion

Merry Christmas, tribe.

See you in the trenches next year.
