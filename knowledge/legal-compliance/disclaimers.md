# Canonical disclaimers

Use these when the project or agents need to state that content is not advice or to disclose risk.

## Not financial advice

- **Short:** "This is not financial advice. For information only."
- **Standard:** "Nothing here is financial, investment, tax, or legal advice. For informational and educational purposes only. Do your own research; past performance does not guarantee future results."

## For information only

- "This content is for information only and does not constitute a recommendation or offer to buy or sell any asset or product."

## Risk disclaimer

- "Trading and investing involve substantial risk of loss. Only risk what you can afford to lose. Consider seeking advice from a qualified professional."

## When agents discuss markets or trading

- When any agent (VINCE, Solus, Eliza, etc.) discusses markets, options, perps, or trading: prefer attaching the "Not financial advice" short or standard line where appropriate. Eliza owns the canonical wording and can supply it when asked.
