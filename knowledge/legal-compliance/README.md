# Legal & Compliance

This folder holds canonical legal and compliance wording for the project. Use it when agents (especially Eliza) need to cite disclaimers, "not financial advice", or risk language.

- **disclaimers.md** — Copy-paste friendly lines: not financial advice, for information only, risk disclaimer.

When asked for disclaimers or compliance language, answer from these files only; do not invent wording.
