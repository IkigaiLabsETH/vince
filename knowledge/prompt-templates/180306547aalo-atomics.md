---Months ago, we joined the Series B in Aalo Atomics. At the time, most people outside a small circle of nuclear nerds and AI infrastructure investors had never heard of the company. Today, after the Forbes cover, the Microsoft AI-permitting partnership, the Urenco fuel contract, and the first steel going into the ground at Idaho National Lab, Aalo is suddenly “the hot nuclear name.” 

This is the piece I wish I could have published the day we wired the money, but NDAs and market optics prevented it. Now that the round is public and construction is visible from space (literally, you can see the Aalo-X pad on Google Earth if you know where to look), it’s time to explain, in full detail, why we believe Aalo is the single most asymmetric bet in energy today.

**1. The Thesis in One Sentence**

Aalo has compressed what historically took the nuclear industry 15–25 years (concept → first concrete → first criticality) into less than 36 months, and they are doing it with a product that was purpose-built for the only customer on Earth that can pay whatever it takes for always-on, zero-carbon electrons: hyperscale AI training clusters.

Every other advanced nuclear company is still arguing about where to put their first plant. Aalo already has the dirt, the fuel, the DOE blessing, and a signed term sheet from a cloud provider that wants the electrons the day the turbine spins up.

**2. The Timeline That Still Makes People Laugh**

Founding to fission in <1,600 days. For context, Vogtle Units 3 & 4 took 17 years from construction start to commercial operation and cost $35 B. Aalo-X will cost low-double-digit millions and will be done before Vogtle’s final commissioning report is fully archived.

**3. The Technology Is Not Science Fiction **

Sodium-cooled fast reactors are not new. EBR-II ran flawlessly at the same INL site from 1964 to 1994 and demonstrated inherent passive safety in 1986 by shutting itself down with no operator action and no power after they deliberately turned off all coolant pumps. What is new is treating the reactor as a product instead of a megaproject.
**
Each Aalo-1 reactor is a sleek, three-meter-tall, one-meter-wide cylinder that tips the scales at under thirty tons—small enough to roll down the highway on a regular flatbed like an oversized Tesla coil. Five of them, plus a single turbine hall, make a complete 50 MW Aalo Pod that sits on just three acres, drinks zero water once it’s running, and can be clicked together in weeks. Because the sodium coolant runs at atmospheric pressure, the vessels are thin-walled, robot-welded in an Austin factory, and ride a cost curve that’s starting to look a lot more like solar panels dropping 20 % a year than the multi-decade, multi-billion-dollar heartbreak of Olkiluoto. The MARVEL microreactor that Yasir Arafat (now Aalo’s CTO) led at INL is essentially the 90 % de-risked spiritual predecessor. Aalo is taking that reference design, stretching it from 100 kWt to 30 MWt per core, and then mass-producing it.

4. The Demand Side Is the Most Mispriced Tailwind**

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and the IEA now agree: global data-center power demand will grow 15–20 % CAGR through 2035, driven almost entirely by AI training and inference. In the United States alone we are looking at an incremental 100–150 GW of new demand by 2032. That is another California, built in eight years, on top of everything else.

Every single hyperscaler has publicly admitted that the grid cannot deliver this power in the required time frame or geography. Their only options are:

- 
(a) build their own generation, or

- 
(b) throttle AI growth.

Option (b) is not on the table for any company whose market cap is measured in trillions. Therefore (a) is inevitable.

Aalo Pods are the only advanced fission product that can be quoted, contracted, and delivered on a timeline that matches the build-out cadence of a 500 MW training cluster. Oklo’s Aurora is beautiful, but it is still years from a COL. TerraPower’s Natrium is a 345 MWe beast that needs a grid intertie. Kairos and X-energy are chasing the same hyperscaler dollars but are further behind on fuel and site.

Aalo is not “one of many.” For the 2029–2032 window, Aalo is effectively the only Western advanced reactor that can be ordered in lots of 50–500 MWe and dropped next to a greenfield training campus in Texas, Virginia, Ohio, or Ireland.

**5. The Optionality Stack Is Absurd**

Even if you believe the base case is “merely” hundreds of Pods sold to cloud providers at $4–6 B capex per GW (already a multi-hundred-billion TAM), the embedded options are what make the risk/reward obscene:

And that’s just the opening act. Once the Aalo-1 Pods are humming next to every hyperscaler campus, the company will roll out the Aalo-2: a single, beefier 100 MW unit designed to slide right into the footprint of a retired coal plant and keep the lights on for an entire city. Build a thousand of them and the fleet learning curve kicks in—costs plummet so hard that 3 ¢ per kilowatt-hour (cheaper than almost any fossil plant on Earth) stops being a dream and becomes the new normal. At that point the reactors start doing double duty: the “waste” heat can make carbon-free steel, split water for green hydrogen, or turn seawater into drinking water. Because they’re fast-spectrum machines, they can eventually eat their own spent fuel and close the loop—giving us, for the first time in human history, a source of energy that’s effectively infinite. And when we’re ready to leave Earth for good, sodium reactors are the only realistic way to keep more than a few light bulbs glowing on the Moon or Mars. 

One platform, five consecutive grand slams.

We do not need all of these to work. 

We only need the first one, and the rest are free call options struck at zero.

**6. The Team Is the Closest Thing to a SpaceX Reunion Show in Energy**

- 
Matt Loszak (CEO): physicist-turned-software engineer who spent years optimizing hardware production pipelines before going all-in on nuclear.

- 
Yasir Arafat (CTO): literally the person who built and started up MARVEL at INL. He knows every lesson learned from that program and brought the entire playbook with him.

- 
Tim Frazier (VP Government): ran Zeno Power’s DOE portfolio and understands how to turn GAIN vouchers into real hardware.

- 
The factory floor in Austin is now full of ex-Tesla, SpaceX, and Rivian manufacturing engineers who looked at nuclear and said, “Wait, you’re telling me no one has ever applied Gigafactory principles here?”

This is not a team of academics who read a book about manufacturing. This is a team that has shipped physical products at scale and is now applying those playbooks to the hardest manufacturing problem on Earth.

7. Risks (Because We Are Not Delusional)

Of course nuclear has risks. The main ones we spend time on:

- 
NRC licensing delay on the commercial Pod (mitigated by the Aalo-X experimental license path and the DOE pilot program).

- 
Sodium fires/leaks (mitigated by 60 years of operating experience and modern double-walled piping).

- 
HALEU supply (mitigated by the Urenco contract and the fact that Aalo’s first dozens of units can run on regular LEU UO₂ if needed).

- 
Political whiplash (2026 mid-terms, 2028 election, etc.).

None of these are trivial, but every single one is dramatically de-risked relative to any prior nuclear venture. And the downside is capped: we lose our investment. The upside is a century-defining energy company.

**8. The Bottom Line**

We did not invest in Aalo Atomics because we love nuclear power (although we do). We invested because the convergence of (1) explosive AI-driven power demand, (2) a technology that is finally ready for prime time, and (3) a team that is moving at a speed the industry has literally never seen before, has created a dislocation so large that it feels irresponsible not to own a piece of it.

In 2016, people laughed at reusable rockets. In 2022, people laughed at the idea that data centers would bring back nuclear. In 2025, the people still laughing are running out of time. The first sodium loop at Aalo-X will be filled in the first half of 2026. When that reactor goes critical on or before July 4th next year, the entire conversation about “nuclear is always 10 years away” ends overnight.

We are proud and (very) biased believers in the team. Onward.
