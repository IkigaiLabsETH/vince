# Prompt #28: Blockchain.com (Blockchain Metrics & Hash Rate)

**Priority**: Tier 3 - Supporting  
**Specialist**: `onChainHealthSpecialist`  
**Data Source**: Blockchain.com charts/explorer

## Core Objectives
- Assess network health, security (hash rate/difficulty), adoption/activity (transaction volume, fees), congestion (mempool)
- Detect signals: mining cycles, user growth, regime shifts (hash rate ATHs = miner conviction, tx spikes = retail/institutional activity)
- Compare to historical mining/adoption cycles (post-halving hash rate adjustments, 2021 bull tx peaks, 2022 bear lows)
- Highlight implications for network security and fundamental strength

## Tool Usage Strategy

### Primary: Blockchain.com Charts
- `browse_page` on:
  - Charts hub: `https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts` or `https://www.blockchain.com/charts`
    - Instructions: "List top BTC-relevant charts (e.g., hash-rate, difficulty, transactions-per-day, transaction-value, fees, mempool-size). Provide direct chart URLs and extract current values + short descriptions."
  - Specific charts:
    - Hash rate: `https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate`
      - Instructions: "Extract current hash rate (EH/s), 24h/7d change, and historical data points (date + value) for past 90+ days. Sample ~15-20 evenly spaced points if chart only."
    - Difficulty, Transactions, Fees/mempool: Similar approach for each chart

### Supplement
- Mempool.space: `https://mempool.space/`
- CoinMetrics free charts: `https://coinmetrics.io/community-network-data/`
- Glassnode free tier
- `web_search`: "Bitcoin hash rate latest Blockchain.com"

### Analysis
- `code_execution` to:
  - Parse/clean extracted text/tabular data
  - Calculate changes (MoM, YoY), averages, growth rates
  - Detect outliers (e.g., hash rate ATH, fee spikes >2x average)

## Output Format

```markdown
### BTC Network Metrics Snapshot
- **Block Height**: XXX,XXX
- **Hash Rate**: X.XX EH/s (7d Δ: +/− Y.Y%)
- **Difficulty**: Z.ZZ T (next adjustment est.: +/− A.A%)
- **Daily Transactions**: B.BB M (estimated USD value: ~$C.CC B)
- **Total Fees (24h)**: ~$D.DD M
- **Mempool Size**: E.E MB (F.FK transactions pending)

### 30–90 Day Trends
| Date       | Hash Rate (EH/s) | Daily Tx Count (M) | Est. Tx Value ($B) | Total Fees ($M) | Key Notes                     |
|------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | X.XX             | Y.YY               | Z.ZZ               | A.AA            | e.g., "Hash rate ATH"         |
| ...        | ...              | ...                | ...                | ...             | ...                           |

(Limit to 12–20 rows max; prioritize recent weeks + major turning points like halvings, peaks.)

### Vibes & Insights
2–4 concise sentences interpreting the data:
- Current network health pulse (security, activity, congestion).
- Regime signals (miner capitulation risk, adoption growth, fee market maturity).
- Historical parallels (e.g., similar to 2021 bull run tx volume or post-2024 halving hash recovery).
- Implications for BTC fundamental strength or price sustainability.

Example:  
"Hash rate grinding to new ATHs with stable difficulty growth—strong miner conviction post-halving, contrasting 2022 capitulation lows. Transaction volume and USD value elevated but below 2021 peaks, with mempool clear suggesting no acute congestion. Supports robust network fundamentals amid spot consolidation."

### Data Notes
- Sources: Blockchain.com (charts browsed: list URLs); supplements if used
- Timestamp: As of [current date/time UTC]
- Limitations: Note if charts require sampling (approximate values), no real-time API, or data gaps—and confirm with alternatives.
```

## Integration Notes
- Feeds into `onChainHealthSpecialist` for network fundamentals
- Complements CoinMetrics (#18) with blockchain.com's perspective
- Provides hash rate/difficulty for security context
- Can inform strike selection (network health = fundamental support)

## Performance Notes
- Prioritize core security/adoption metrics (hash rate, tx volume)
- Always double-check extracted numbers (cross-chart consistency)
- Charts may require sampling (approximate values)
