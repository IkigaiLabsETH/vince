# Prompt #16: Nansen (Smart Money Flows & Wallet Activity)

**Priority**: Tier 2 - High Value  
**Specialist**: `institutionalSpecialist`  
**Data Source**: Nansen.ai (public research and dashboards)

## Core Objectives
- Track Bitcoin smart money movements: labeled entity flows (smart money wallets, funds, institutions, whales, miners)
- Analyze exchange deposits/withdrawals, net inflows/outflows, holder distribution (direct BTC or wBTC on Ethereum)
- Detect signals: institutional/whale conviction, accumulation/distribution, regime shifts
- Compare to historical cycle analogs (2021 whale games, 2023 bottom accumulation, post-ETF institutional ramps)

## Tool Usage Strategy

### Primary: Nansen Research & Dashboards
- `browse_page` on:
  - Research hub: `https://www.nansen.ai/research`
    - Instructions: "List the 10 most recent reports/articles (title, publication date, short description). Identify and prioritize any focused on Bitcoin, smart money, on-chain flows, whale activity, exchange movements, or market regimes. Provide direct URLs to the full reports."
  - Individual reports: Browse relevant report URLs
    - Instructions: "Summarize Bitcoin-specific sections (direct BTC or wBTC). Extract key quoted metrics (e.g., smart money net flow +X K BTC last week, whale deposits $Y B, top entity moves, holder concentration). Pull historical context or chart descriptions."
  - Public dashboards: `https://app.nansen.ai/` or BTC/wBTC pages
    - Instructions: "Extract free/public metrics: smart money inflows/outflows, exchange flows, labeled wallet activity, holder distribution if visible without login."

### Supplement
- CryptoQuant free charts: `https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc`
- Glassnode free on-chain data or Arkham public entity tracking
- `web_search`: "Nansen Bitcoin smart money report latest 2025/2026" OR "Nansen BTC whale flows"

### Analysis
- `code_execution` to:
  - Parse/clean extracted transaction/flow lists
  - Calculate net flows, weekly aggregates, outlier detection
  - Generate trend descriptions

## Output Format

```markdown
### Nansen BTC Smart Money Snapshot
- **Smart Money Net Flow** (7d/30d): +/− X,XXX BTC (~$Y.YY B)
- **Whale Activity** (e.g., >1k BTC moves, 24h): Z transactions ($A.AA B volume)
- **Exchange Net Flows** (24h/7d): +/− B,BBB BTC (positive = net deposits)
- **Top Labeled Moves**: e.g., "Funds +C.CK BTC; Miners -D.DK BTC"
- **Holder Concentration** (wBTC if relevant): Top 10: EE.EE%

### 30–90 Day Trends (Where Available)
| Date/Period | Smart Money Net (BTC) | Exchange Net (BTC) | Whale Tx Volume ($B) | Key Notes                          |
|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD  | +/− X,XXX             | +/− Y,YYY          | Z.ZZ                 | e.g., "Smart money inflow spike"   |
| ...         | ...                   | ...                | ...                  | ...                                |

(Limit to 10–15 rows max; prioritize recent weeks + major entity moves.)

### Cross-Verification (Alternatives)
- Alignment: e.g., "Flows consistent with CryptoQuant exchange data."
- Supplements if primary limited (e.g., paywalled deep labels).

### Vibes & Insights
2–4 concise sentences interpreting the data:
- Current smart money pulse (accumulation vs. distribution).
- Regime signals (net outflows = conviction, whale deposits = caution).
- Historical parallels (e.g., similar to 2023 institutional stacking).
- Implications for BTC spot pressure or cycle phase.

Example:  
"Smart money wallets showing consistent net inflows (+20K BTC over 30d) with reduced exchange deposits—strong accumulation signal from labeled institutions/whales. Whale transaction volume subdued, contrasting 2021 distribution peaks. Supports bullish conviction amid spot consolidation."

### Data Notes
- Sources: Nansen (pages browsed: list URLs, e.g., research reports); supplements if used
- Timestamp: As of [current date/time UTC]
- Limitations: Free/public access often limited to reports/surface metrics—deep wallet labels typically pro-only; wBTC/Ethereum data may proxy direct BTC; confirmed with alternatives where needed.

## Integration Notes
- Primary input for `institutionalSpecialist` (smart money tracking)
- Can be combined with Dune (#6) for "Smart Money + Custom Queries" agent (per Grok suggestion)
- Provides institutional conviction signals (net inflows = bullish, deposits = caution)
- Can inform strike selection (smart money positioning affects price pressure)

## Performance Notes
- Free/public access often limited to reports/surface metrics (deep labels pro-only)
- Prioritize labeled/smart money flows (treat unlabeled large moves cautiously)
- Net exchange outflows as bullish signal (self-custody shift)
- If Nansen public data sparse, clearly state and rely heavily on verified report summaries/alternatives
