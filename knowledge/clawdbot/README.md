# Clawdbot / OpenClaw knowledge

Operational playbooks for OpenClaw (Clawdbot): setup, security, automation patterns, and **X research without the X API**.

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **[instructions-clawdbot.md](instructions-clawdbot.md)** | Full setup & security: Hetzner VPS, Raspberry Pi, Tailscale, Venice AI, Matrix, Birdy (X), RSS. |
| **[x-research-agent-curated-follows.md](x-research-agent-curated-follows.md)** | **Key feature for VINCE:** X research agent — dedicated X account + curated follow list (decade of curation) + Birdy → surface threads/URLs → VINCE knowledge pipeline. No X API cost. |
| [openclaw-practical-tips.md](openclaw-practical-tips.md) | What actually works: private Discord + channels, small tasks, when to use Claude Code. |
| [plan-one-click-install.md](plan-one-click-install.md) | One-click install flow; env-file mode; Discord channel layout. |
| [business-idea-openclaw-one-click.md](business-idea-openclaw-one-click.md) | Business ideas around OpenClaw setup and support. |

See **PLAN-SLACK-DISCORD-KNOWLEDGE-RESEARCH.md** (repo root) for how Clawdbot fits into Slack/Discord setup, knowledge expansion, and the X → knowledge pipeline.
