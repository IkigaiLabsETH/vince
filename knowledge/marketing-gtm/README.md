# Marketing & GTM

Positioning, one-pager, Substack, and GTM for the project. Eliza owns this lane: she is the Substack writer and pushes "Substack gold."

- **positioning.md** — What we do, for whom, differentiation (e.g. macOS of autonomous agents, push-not-pull).
- **substack-editorial.md** — Substack voice and when to publish what (optional).

Use `knowledge/marketing-gtm` and `substack-essays` for narrative and positioning. When asked "how do we describe ourselves" or "what's our positioning", answer from here.
