# Positioning

One-pager and elevator pitch for the project.

## What we do

- **Product:** Unified data-intelligence agent (options, perps, memes, lifestyle, art) with a self-improving paper trading bot at the core. Push, not pull: daily intel (ALOHA), PERPS, OPTIONS, "trade today?" delivered to Discord/Slack.
- **Agents:** Eliza (CEO: knowledge, research, GTM, Substack; improve and expand knowledge base), VINCE (CDO: data, paper bot—no marketing), Solus (CFO: execution, $100K stack), Otaku (COO: DeFi; only agent with funded wallet—DeFi, NFT mint, onchain), Kelly (CHRO: lifestyle), Sentinel (CTO: ops, cost; gen art → Otaku mints).

## For whom

- People who want to stay in the game without 12+ hours on screens. Crypto to live well, not be consumed. One command for vibe check and execution context.

## Differentiation

- **"macOS of autonomous agents"** — We're building the macOS of autonomous agents. Ours is cuter and more degen.
- **Push, not pull** — You never have to "chat" for the day report; the agent pings you.
- **Paper edge → revenue** — Self-improving paper bot, feature store, ONNX; no redeploy to improve ML. Prove edge, then scale.

## Elevator pitch (one sentence)

- We're building the macOS of autonomous agents: push intel and paper edge, not pull; prove edge then scale.
