I’m scrolling through X, that endless feed of hype and half-truths I’ve been glued to since ‘07, when it was still called Twitter and felt like a secret club.

And there it is—this infographic from Carbon Finance, popping up like an old scar itching in the rain. Top 10 private behemoths by valuation, with SpaceX at the helm, gunning for a $1.5 trillion IPO in mid-to-late 2026. Trillion with a T.

## Context

I nearly spit out my whiskey. Not because it’s surprising—Elon’s been building rockets since I was still grinding through the founder-mode hell of WebTV back in the ‘90s—but because it drags me right back to the trenches.

The bubbles I’ve survived, the shorts that nearly buried me, the wins that felt like dumb luck. And the regrets? Oh, they’re always there, whispering about the ones I sold too soon, again and again.

Honestly, I escaped that founder grind years ago, traded it for the quiet life of an unemployable misfit turned angel investor. No more boardroom battles, just me, strong coffee, and sharp charts in a spot far from the madness. But this? This wave of mega-IPOs—SpaceX, OpenAI, ByteDance, the whole lot—it’s got me dissecting the past like an autopsy at dawn.

## Main

I’ve seen valuations like these before, whispers turning into roars, only to crash when the music stops. Remember the dot-com frenzy? I do. I was there, pioneering WebTV, featured by Apple no less, thinking we’d change the world. We did, sort of, but not before the bubble popped and left scars.

Quiksilver was another ride—surf culture meets Wall Street, all hype until the tide went out. I got out okay, but not without the family strain, the redemptions forcing sales at the worst times. Classic me, blinded by metrics, missing the human toll.

But enough navel-gazing. Let’s cut into this list, company by company. These aren’t just numbers; they’re stories of ambition, overreach, and the cold math of value versus speculation.

I’ll weave in the chronology—the founding pains, the funding rounds that ballooned them into monsters—pulled from dusty filings, recent X chatter, and the kind of insider whispers that keep me up at night.

And yeah, I’ll admit where I might be wrong. No crystal ball here, just hard-earned cynicism laced with a contrarian’s hope.

Start with the big dog: SpaceX. Founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, back when he was fresh off PayPal and most folks thought reusable rockets were sci-fi nonsense.

I remember the early days—Series A in 2006 at a modest $74 million valuation, scraping by on government contracts and Musk’s own pocket change.

> By 2012, after the first Dragon docking with the ISS, they hit $4.8 billion post-Series G. Fast-forward through the rounds: $1 billion in 2015 at $12 billion valuation, then exploding upward—$36 billion by 2020, $100 billion in 2021, $140 billion in 2022. Now? Latest insider tender in December 2025 pegs it at $800 billion, up from $350 billion just months prior. That’s the rocket fuel of Starlink subscriptions and NASA deals. But the $1.5 trillion IPO target? That’s aspirational, like Musk’s Mars dreams.

Internal memos I dug up confirm mid-2026 prep, with Morgan Stanley likely leading the charge. Risks? FAA regs, Starship explosions—I’ve seen tech darlings crater on execution slips. It’s got that rare moat: scale, tech, and a visionary who delivers. On X, sentiment’s electric—users betting it’ll eclipse Tesla’s cap post-IPO. Me? I’d nibble, but warily. Value investing’s hard mode in a hype world.

> And then there’s OpenAI, the AI phenom that’s got everyone frothing. Born in 2015 as a nonprofit, pivoted to for-profit in 2019 with Microsoft’s $1 billion infusion at a $20 billion valuation. Rounds piled on: $10 billion from Microsoft in 2023 at $29 billion, then exploding—$86 billion in early 2024, $157 billion by October 2024. Now? Talks of $830 billion in a $100 billion raise by Q1 2026. Revenue’s ramping—$3.7 billion in 2024, eyeing $12.7 billion in 2025. IPO chatter points to 2027, filings late 2026. Opportunities? GPT leadership, enterprise push. But the burn—$1.4 trillion planned AI spend? Bubble territory.

ByteDance, TikTok’s shadowy parent, is a geopolitical minefield. Founded 2012 in Beijing, early rounds modest—$5 million Series A at $50 million valuation. Blew up: $75 billion by 2018, $140 billion in 2020, steady at $480 billion now per November 2025 share auction. Profits? $50 billion in 2025. U.S. JV with Oracle dodges bans, clearing for 2026 U.S./HK listing. AI OS adds intrigue, but China-West tensions loom. Optimism on U.S. deal, caution on privacy.

ByteDance’s a wildcard; I’d sit it out.

> Anthropic, the “constitutional AI” upstart, founded 2021 by ex-OpenAI folks. Bootstrapped early, then Amazon’s $4 billion in 2023 at $18.4 billion valuation. Surged: $40 billion in 2024, $183 billion post-Series F September 2025. Now eyeing $300 billion+ private round, IPO prep with Wilson Sonsini and Airbnb’s ex-CFO. Validation for ethical AI, but profitability whispers. Risks? Liquidity-fueled bubble. I’d watch, not dive.

xAI, Musk’s latest, launched 2023. $6 billion Series B at $24 billion in 2024, now $230 billion in November 2025 talks for $15 billion raise. No IPO plans, but Grok 5 end-2025, Nvidia-backed chips. Opaque revenues, but Musk ties boost.

Low 2025 odds imho.

Databricks, the data lakehouse king, founded 2013. $1.6 billion Series H at $38 billion in 2021, $43 billion in 2023, now $134 billion post-$4 billion Series L December 2025. $4.8 billion run rate, 55% growth. CEO cites volatility but readiness for 2026 IPO.

$1 trillion long-term potential. Solid, but AI commoditization risk.

Stripe, payments stalwart, founded 2010. Peaked $95 billion 2021, dipped to $50 billion 2023, back to $107 billion February 2025 tender. Profitable FY24, teases late 2025/early 2026 IPO. Polymarket favors 2025. Fintech slowdowns? Seen ‘em.

Revolut, fintech disruptor, founded 2015. $33 billion 2021, now $75 billion November 2025 secondary. $4 billion 2024 revenue, targets $9 billion 2026 with $3.5 billion profit. Dual U.S.-UK listing eyed for 2027+.

Canva, design democratizer, founded 2012. $40 billion 2021, $42 billion October 2025. $3.3 billion ARR, 260 million users. Affinity acquisition bolsters. COO signals 2026-2027 readiness. Late 2026 plausible.

Ramp, agentic finance play, founded 2019. $13 billion March 2025, $32 billion November 2025 post-$500 million raise. No firm plans, but scaling fast. Polymarket: 10% odds.

Surveying this, 2026 could unleash $2.9 trillion. AI drives narrative, but geopolitics, regs, profitability gaps lurk.

I’ve learned: Value trumps speculation.

Stacking sats quietly now.

We’ll see—keep reading filings.

Yeah, that dot-com echo rings true—it’s like watching history rhyme in real time. The ‘90s bubble popped the speculators, but the rails (fiber optics, protocols, servers) got laid in the aftermath, setting up the FAANG empires that followed.

Crypto’s in that same post-hype trough: the L1s, DeFi primitives, and scaling tech are solidifying into unglamorous but essential layers.

Prices tanking while AI grabs the VC floodlights? Classic misallocation—marginal capital always chases the narrative du jour, whether it’s pets.com or the latest LLM wrapper.

The unfair bit stings, no doubt. OG builders shipping code in bear markets, only for Big Tech to swoop in, fork the repos, and monetize via proprietary stacks.

Tokenomics getting wrecked by inflation, airdrops to VCs, or just plain rug-pull vibes. Maturation means fading into the background. Bitcoin as digital gold? Ethereum as settlement layer? That’s plumbing, not fireworks.

The revolutionaries pivot to operators, and the patient ones (with dry powder) compound when adoption hits escape velocity.

On the flip side, AI’s not immune—it’s got its own hype cycle peaking now, with plenty of vaporware amid the gems. But the winners there will be the ones building durable infra too, not just shiny demos. Patience as the edge? Spot on.

## Conclusion

Most projects won’t rebound because they were never built to last; survival bias will favor the antifragile. Hang in there—crypto’s “boring” phase might just be the prelude to ubiquity. What part of this cycle are you betting on most?

Or are you bullish af on the Mega-IPO Wave?
