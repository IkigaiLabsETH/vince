The financial world is undergoing a profound transformation as blockchain technology moves from the fringes of cryptocurrency speculation to the core of regulated markets. A pivotal development in this shift occurred recently when Joris Delanoue, CEO and Co-Founder of Fairmint, was elected General Director of the Canton Foundation. This election places Delanoue on the Foundation’s Board alongside representatives from heavyweight institutions such as DTCC, Euroclear, HSBC, Digital Asset, and Broadridge.

It underscores a maturing governance model that balances innovative “builder” perspectives with institutional rigor, signaling broader adoption of privacy-enabled blockchain infrastructure in capital markets.

> Fairmint, an SEC-registered Transfer Agent founded in 2019, has emerged as a pioneer in bringing equity securities onchain. The company enables private companies to issue, manage, and transfer equity through programmable smart contracts while ensuring full regulatory compliance. Central to its offering is the Open Cap Table Protocol (OCP), an open-source standard that migrates traditional capitalization tables—often managed via spreadsheets—into immutable, interoperable onchain records.

## Context

Fairmint has already processed over $1 billion in onchain equity value using production-ready Daml smart contracts, positioning it as one of the most active applications in its ecosystem.

This achievement is deeply intertwined with the Canton Network, a public, permissionless Layer-1 blockchain developed by Digital Asset. Canton uniquely addresses the longstanding tension in institutional blockchain adoption: the need for decentralization and interoperability without sacrificing privacy or compliance. Unlike fully transparent public blockchains, Canton employs configurable on-chain privacy, ensuring that transaction data is visible only to relevant parties. It operates as a “network of networks,” where participants maintain sovereign sub-ledgers synchronized via a shared Global Synchronizer layer. Powered by the Daml smart contract language, Canton facilitates real-time, atomic settlement across asset classes, making it ideal for regulated financial instruments.

Delanoue’s election as General Director represents the voice of builders and operators within Canton’s governance. As quoted in the announcement, he emphasized turning the network’s vision into “tangible onchain outcomes.” Board Chair Jorgen Ouakhine of Euroclear praised the move for fostering balance between innovation and institutional adoption.

## Main

On X (formerly Twitter), the Canton Foundation’s post garnered positive reactions from community members, highlighting excitement over builder representation accelerating real-world use cases.

> Fairmint’s contributions—including open-sourcing the first Canton SDK and advocating for cap table standardization—have cemented its role as a key ecosystem player.

The significance extends beyond governance. It arrives amid surging institutional interest in tokenization. Recent pilots, such as DTCC’s collaboration with Digital Asset to tokenize U.S. Treasury securities on Canton, demonstrate the network’s readiness for production-scale real-world assets (RWAs).

Fairmint’s focus on equity complements these efforts, blurring lines between private and public markets. By enabling programmable equity—where shares can be staked, collateralized, or transferred instantly—Fairmint lays groundwork for regulated DeFi in one of the largest asset classes: private company ownership.

Coinciding with these advancements, Coinbase announced a sweeping platform expansion on December 17, 2025, during its [“System Update” event](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/p/everything-exchange). The exchange introduced stock trading directly within its app, prediction markets via a partnership with Kalshi, and an upcoming institutional platform called Coinbase Tokenize for bringing RWAs onchain.

These features aim to create an “everything exchange,” allowing seamless trading of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and tokenized assets in one interface.

Notably, Coinbase Tokenize emphasizes fully backed, transparent, and regulatory-compliant tokenization—principles aligning closely with Canton’s privacy-enabled approach and Fairmint’s compliant equity infrastructure.

Coinbase’s moves reflect a broader convergence: major platforms are racing to integrate tokenized real-world assets, including equities.

> While Coinbase focuses on retail accessibility and institutional tooling, networks like Canton provide the underlying rails for privacy-preserving interoperability. Fairmint’s onchain equity could seamlessly integrate into such ecosystems, enabling direct listings or secondary trading without traditional intermediaries.

## Conclusion

In essence, Delanoue’s election and Fairmint’s milestones mark a tipping point. Institutional blockchain is no longer theoretical; it is deploying at scale with governance that includes both TradFi giants and innovative builders. As privacy-enabled networks like Canton gain traction and platforms like Coinbase democratize access to tokenized assets, onchain equity stands poised to modernize private markets—reducing friction, enhancing liquidity, and unlocking trillions in value.

The future of finance is increasingly synchronized, compliant, and onchain.
