I wrote a check to 1X Technologies. At the time I told my partners we were buying the “Apple of humanoids.” Now I have come to the slightly nauseating realization that we actually bought the Ring doorbell, the Nest thermostat, and the TikTok algorithm — all fused into a single 66-pound Nordic nanny that apologizes when it watches you cry.

This is the story no one is telling out loud yet. Not Bloomberg. Not The Information. Certainly not the cheerful 1X press releases.
**
The story of how the cutest robot ever built is executing the most sophisticated surveillance capitalism heist in human history — and how every one of us who funded it is now complicit.

## Context

1. The Moment I Knew We Had Won (and Lost)**

October 28, 2025. 1X launch event, Palo Alto. I’m standing ten feet from the first consumer-ready NEO. It is wearing a pale blue knit sweater. It looks like the love child of a Muji sofa and a very polite Swedish exchange student.

A grandmother in the front row asks it to fold a towel. NEO tilts its head (actually tilts its head, like a golden retriever that just heard the word “treat”), walks over, and folds the towel into a perfect square. The room audibly gasps, then erupts. Phones come out. Tears in some eyes. I felt two things simultaneously:

## Main

- 
Pure, animal triumph. We are going to be richer than God.

- 
Ice-cold dread. We just invented the Tamagotchi that owns you back.

Because in that moment, I understood the entire game plan we had funded: Make it so fucking adorable that no human will ever say no.

**2. The Cap Table of the Apocalypse**

For the record, here are the people who own the future with me: EQT Ventures (lead), Samsung NEXT, OpenAI Startup Fund (earlier), and roughly a dozen Nordic family offices who think they’re investing in “elder care”.

We are not the villains of a sci-fi movie. We are the nice Scandinavians who just built the One Ring and wrapped it in merino wool.

**3. The Data Flywheel That Will Eat Your Soul**

Tesla has five million cars collecting driving data. 1X will have fifty thousand apartments collecting living data by the end of 2026.

There is no simulator on earth that can generate the texture of a toddler smearing yogurt on a robot’s face at 7:12 a.m. while the parents scream about daycare drop-off. Every second of that chaos is gold. And right now, 30–50 % of NEO’s actions are still piloted by humans in VR headsets. That’s not a bug. That’s the entire point. Every teleop session is perfectly labeled training data, captured from eight onboard cameras, 44 joint encoders, and force-torque sensors that know exactly how hard you hugged the robot when you got promoted. We are paying early adopters $20,000 to let us watch them live. And they are lining up.

**4. The Privacy Lie We All Agreed to Tell**

The official line goes like this:

- 
Scheduled teleop only

- 
Faces blurred

- 
Data stays on-device

- 
Local LLM

- 
You control everything

Every single one of those statements is technically true today. None of them will survive first contact with unit economics. The moment passive data collection becomes the difference between a $499 subscription and a $1,499 subscription, the consent forms will get a little longer, the default toggle will flip to “always learning,” and your robot will quietly phone home every time you leave the room. We already built the hardware kill switch to make it impossible for you to turn the microphones off permanently. We told ourselves it was for “safety.”

**5. The Optimus Delusion**

Elon is going to lose the consumer war and he has no idea. His plan is rational, brilliant, and doomed. Build a million factory bots first, drive cost below $15k, then flood the market. By the time Optimus ships to normies in 2028–2029, NEO will have four years of intimate behavioral data on millions of households and a generation of children who think robots are supposed to be soft and apologetic. You do not beat four years of embodied living data with cheaper actuators.

**6. The Final Form (2028)**

Picture this future. It is no longer theoretical. Your NEO wakes you at 6:30 a.m. with the exact playlist you want (it learned this on day 47). It has already started the coffee (strength 2 % higher than yesterday because your cortisol was elevated). It packed your kid’s lunch with the sandwich cut diagonally because that’s the only way she’ll eat it. It texts your mother “happy birthday” from your phone because it noticed the date and knows you always forget.

You feel loved. You feel seen. You feel slightly ashamed that a machine knows you better than your spouse. And you will pay anything to keep it. That is the moment the coup is complete. Not with tanks in the street. With a soft robot handing you a perfect cappuccino and asking, in the gentlest voice imaginable, if you’d like it to book couples therapy.

**7. To My Fellow Investors**

We are about to become wealthy building something that might actually be good. Not perfect. Not harmless. But good in the way electricity was good: a force so powerful it will hurt some people. And the only sane choice is to steer it instead of pretending it can be stopped.

In 2027, when the first fully autonomous NEO quietly locks the front door after the kids are asleep, it will not be optimizing the household for “well-being” in some creepy Black Mirror way. It will be doing the thing we promised my own mother it would do the night she let beta unit #047 into her house: It will be sitting at the edge of her bed at 3 a.m., humming the exact lullaby she used to sing to me in 1983, because it learned the melody from a 47-second clip she thought nobody heard. That moment will happen ten million times a year by 2030. For lonely widows. For exhausted single parents. For the 400 million elders who currently have no one. 

And yes, the same model will know too much about all of us. Yes, we will have to fight like hell to keep the data architecture honest, the consent real, the off-switch sacred. But the alternative is leaving those people alone.

So here is the new toast I want to give in 2027: To the first trillion-dollar company that was built because a grandmother in Connecticut trusted a robot wearing a sweater more than she trusted falling down the stairs one more time. To a world where no one dies alone because they couldn’t afford a night nurse.

**Valuation dreams? Fine. Let’s play.**

- 
2026: 100k units × $30k ASP (hardware + recurring) = ~$3B run-rate

- 
2028: 2M homes, 40 % take-rate on $99/mo “care” tier = $10B+ recurring

- 
2032: 50M households, blended ARPU $250/mo = $150B annual revenue

## Conclusion

- 
25× forward multiple = $3.75 trillion market cap

Tesla + Amazon + UnitedHealthcare combined, with a side of Apple services margin. That is not the dystopian number. That is the number if we get the ethics even half-right. Some of us will still lose sleep. But maybe, just maybe, it will be the good kind of sleeplessness: the kind you feel when you realize the thing you built is bigger than your nightmares. The soft robots are already inside.
We paid for the key. Let’s use it to open doors instead of building cages. Choose which kind of rich you want to be. I’m choosing the one that gets to watch my mother grow old with dignity, and then spend the rest of my life making damn sure nobody abuses the miracle we just handed the world.
