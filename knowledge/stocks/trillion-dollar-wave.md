I’m going to say something that will sound insane to most people still riding the AI high: the really stupid money—the kind that turns twenty-something founders into billionaires and early believers into legends—isn’t going to be made in another LLM wrapper. It’s going to be made in robotics.

And I don’t mean the cute little vacuum cleaners or the six-axis arms that have been welding car frames for forty years. I mean honest-to-God humanoid robots that walk, talk, fold your laundry, unload the dishwasher, and eventually do 90 % of the physical work humans currently get paid for. That market isn’t measured in hundreds of billions. It’s measured in the only number that actually matters when you’re talking about physical labor: roughly $150 trillion. That’s the annualized value of all human jobs on planet Earth.

## Context

Let that sink in for a second.

While the entire software AI complex fought over a pie that might generously hit a couple trillion in cumulative revenue over the next decade, the robotics players are staring at a pie that is literally two orders of magnitude larger. And unlike software, you can’t just “prompt” your way out of physics. You can’t fake a robot picking up a box, walking across a warehouse, and putting it on a shelf. When it works, you see it. When it ships, the revenue is real. And when the first company ships 100,000 units in a single year at a $25,000 bill-of-materials… well, that’s the iPhone moment we’ve all been waiting for since we were kids watching Terminator 2.

**The Math Is Actually Embarrassing**
**
Let’s do the lazy back-of-the-napkin that every VC pretends they don’t do in the shower: Global labor market: ~$150 trillion

## Main

Let’s be extremely conservative and say humanoids only ever capture 10 % of that over the next twenty years (they’ll do better, but whatever). That’s $15 trillion in annualized economic value displaced or augmented.

The current global auto industry is ~$3.5 trillion in revenue and supports multiple companies at $60–800 billion market caps.

$15 trillion is 4.3× bigger than the entire auto industry today.

Now tell me again why Figure, Apptronik, Agility, 1X, Neura, Sanctuary, or even Tesla’s Optimus shouldn’t be worth a few hundred billion each in five years if they simply execute. Hell, even the also-rans in cars—think Stellantis or Hyundai—still trade north of $30–50 billion. Robotics has higher margins than cars (once you’re past the R&D hump), a bigger TAM, and the single most powerful narrative in modern technology: “We built the sci-fi future you were promised in 1987.”

This Isn’t Winner-Take-All Like AI**

One of the reasons I’m more excited about robotics than I ever was about the last AI wave is simple: there will be more than two or three winners.

In foundation models you had a brutal compute moat. Training runs went from $10 million to $100 million to $1 billion literally overnight. That naturally consolidated the game into a handful of players who could raise $20–50 billion war chests.

Robotics is different. It’s more like the auto industry than the cloud. Yes, there will be leaders—Tesla and Figure feel like the Ford and Toyota of this cycle—but there will be dozens of viable players. You’ll have the luxury German (maybe a Mercedes-backed player), the Korean value king (Samsung or LG will not sit this out), the Chinese price destroyer (Unitree is already selling a pretty decent humanoid for $16 k), and a handful of American pure-plays that focus on software and design like Figure and Apptronik.

The manufacturing supply chain is already there. Actuators, batteries, sensors, carbon fiber—none of this needs to be invented from scratch like 8,000 H100 clusters did. The bottleneck is integration and software, and that’s a game many teams can play.

**The Bubble Will Be Bigger Than AI (And That’s Okay)**

Here’s the part most people miss: the emotional resonance of a humanoid robot is 10× stronger than any chatbot, no matter how smooth.

When ChatGPT dropped in 2022, it was mind-blowing… for about three weeks. Then it became normal. You type, it writes. Cool, whatever.

When Figure 02 or Optimus or Apollo folds a shirt perfectly on stage, or carries groceries up three flights of stairs without being told twice, or helps an elderly person out of a chair—people lose their minds. That’s not a productivity tool. That’s a childhood dream walking around in your living room.

The narrative pull is so strong that every major tech company, every sovereign fund, every pension fund, every growth manager who missed Nvidia at $100 will be desperate to own “the Tesla of robotics.” Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, SoftBank, BlackRock, Ark—they’re all already in. They’re not waiting for proof. They’re waiting for the story to catch fire.

And stories like that don’t trade at 8× sales. They trade at 40×, 60×, sometimes “whatever it takes.” We’ve seen it before. We’ll see it again—only this time the canvas is bigger.

**The Risks Are Real, But They’re Priced for Perfection in the Other Direction**

Yes, regulation will be a nightmare in Europe. Yes, unions will scream. Yes, the first few generations will be clunky and expensive and break in hilarious ways. Yes, China might eat everyone’s lunch on price.

But guess what? All of those risks are already priced in today. Figure is private, Apptronik is private, Tesla’s Optimus is just a line item inside a car company. The public market has exactly zero ways to own this future right now. When the first pure-play IPO hits, or when Tesla breaks out Optimus revenue in 2027, or when Figure ships 50,000 units in a single quarter—the gap between current expectations and reality is going to be measured in multiple trillions of dollars of market cap.

**Final Thought**

I’ve been in tech long enough to see a few once-in-a-generation waves. Internet, mobile, social, cloud, crypto, AI. Each one minted fortunes most people still can’t quite believe were real.

The next one isn’t going to be another app. 

It’s not going to be another model that writes better Python.

It’s going to be the first time in human history when physical labor becomes optional for anyone who can afford it.

And the companies that deliver that future—Figure, Tesla, Apptronik, and a handful of others—are still private, still small, still laughed at by people who think Boston Dynamics videos are just “dancing robots.”

## Conclusion

They laughed at Tesla when it was a $30 billion car company too.

Get ready.
This one’s going to be bigger.
A lot bigger.
