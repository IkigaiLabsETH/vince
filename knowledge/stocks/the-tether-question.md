Ten years ago, almost to the day, a tiny company registered in the British Virgin Islands began minting a token called Realcoin that promised to be worth exactly one United States dollar, forever. They soon renamed it Tether, gave it the ticker USDT, and quietly seeded it onto a handful of obscure exchanges. Nobody imagined that this offshore experiment would one day become the third-largest holder of United States Treasury bills on the planet, outranking most sovereign nations, or that it would move more value every single day than PayPal, Visa Latin America, and the NYSE after-hours session, and the entire Nigerian banking system combined. 

Yet here we are in December 2025, and the same sentence is still being typed into group chats, tweeted by blue-check analysts, and whispered at conference after-parties: “Tether is going to zero this time, for real.” 

## Context

It has been said during every major drawdown since 2017. It was said when the price fell to eighty-five cents, when Terra collapsed, when FTX vaporized, when the European Union banned it, when S&P slapped a “weak” rating on it last month. 

Every single time the obituary was written in advance, and every single time Tether woke up the next morning, printed another billion if someone asked nicely, redeemed another billion if someone got scared, and kept the peg within a fraction of a penny.

So why does the most battle-tested financial instrument in cryptocurrency history remain the most hated? Why do sophisticated investors who would never store serious money on an unregulated exchange still trade their Bitcoin against USDT every day without a second thought? And why, after eleven years of doomsday predictions, has the monster still not bled out in the street?

## Main

The simplest explanation is also the most uncomfortable one: Tether works. It works too well for too many people who are not supposed to have easy access to dollars. It works for traders in Buenos Aires who cannot get a bank account, for remittance corridors in the Philippines that charge thirty percent at Western Union, for mining farms in Kazakhstan that need to pay Chinese suppliers instantly, for over-the-counter desks in Dubai that move hundreds of millions between yuan and crypto without tripping any capital controls. Tether became the shadow dollar because the official dollar is gated, slow, expensive, and, in many parts of the world, simply unavailable on weekends. The market spoke with its wallets, and the market chose the dirty offshore token over every pristine, audited, regulator-approved alternative.

That choice infuriates people who believe finance should be clean, hierarchical, and licensed. When Circle launched USDC with monthly attestations, BlackRock backing, and a New York trust charter, the narrative was supposed to be over. The good stablecoin would drive out the bad one the way Gmail drove out Hotmail. Instead USDC sits at roughly one-third the market cap of USDT and a tenth of the daily volume. The clean token conquered Wall Street conference rooms and Visa press releases, but the dirty token conquered the actual market where real money changes hands every second. There is a lesson in there about human nature that very few people in the industry want to look at directly.

Part of the hatred is tribal. If you spent years telling your audience that Tether was an obvious fraud backed by nothing, it becomes psychologically difficult to admit that the nothing-backed fraud just paid out another ten billion dollars in redemptions without blinking. The sunk-cost fallacy runs deep. 

Another part is ideological: Tether embodies everything traditional finance claims to have solved, opacity, offshore registration, related-party loans, profit extraction on a scale that would make a 1990s investment bank blush.

Watching a company that has never produced a full audit earn more profit than JPMorgan’s retail banking division feels like a cosmic injustice.

And yes, some of the criticism is legitimate. The reserves are weirder than they need to be. Five or six percent in Bitcoin and gold bought with house profits is a gigantic leveraged bet on the assets that USDT is supposed to hedge against. The quarterly attestations from a mid-tier accounting firm are not the same as a Big-Four audit. The fact that redemptions are technically restricted to authorized customers with a hundred-thousand-dollar minimum creates a two-tier system where whales can exit and retail cannot. These are real governance failures, real tail risks, real reasons that prudent institutions keep their treasury stacks in USDC or FDIC-insured products.

But governance failures and tail risks have not been enough to kill it, because Tether is not a company in the normal sense. It is a utility that discovered the world’s strongest network effect: whoever has the deepest liquidity pool wins, and keeps winning forever. Once USDT became the default trading pair on every major Asian exchange, the game was over. You can hate the token, you can short the company, you can write a hundred blog posts about commercial paper and Cantonese lending desks, but you still end up buying your altcoins with USDT because that is where the bids are. Liquidity compounds faster than trust.

The latest round of panic, triggered by Arthur Hayes pointing out that a thirty-percent drawdown in Bitcoin and gold would technically wipe out Tether’s equity buffer, is the perfect microcosm. 

The math checks out on a spreadsheet, yet it ignores the fact that Tether has already lived through multiple fifty-percent Bitcoin crashes and came out larger on the other side. It ignores the twenty-three billion dollars in retained earnings that sit above the issuance entity, the thirty billion in group equity that rating agencies mysteriously exclude from their models, the half-billion a month in risk-free interest income that rolls in whether Bitcoin is ten thousand or a hundred thousand. Spreadsheets are static. Tether is dynamic. It makes new money every day and it spends that money buying the very assets its critics say will destroy it. That is either genius or madness, but it is definitely not the behavior of a Ponzi waiting to collapse.

There is a darker possibility that nobody wants to say out loud: maybe Tether survives precisely because it is too big to fail in a way that regulators have not yet admitted. If USDT actually broke the peg and stayed broken, the cascading liquidations across offshore exchanges would make FTX look like a warm-up exercises. Hundreds of billions in leveraged positions would vanish overnight, taking with them half the mining industry, most Asian retail, and a decent chunk of institutional crypto exposure that quietly routes through stablecoin pairs. Central banks and treasury departments may dislike Tether, but they dislike systemic contagion even more. The same governments that ban it on paper keep looking the other way in practice because the alternatives are worse.

So here we are, eleven years in, still waiting for the final reckoning that never arrives. The peg holds at 0.9998 as I type this sentence. Another billion was minted an hour ago, another billion redeemed twenty minutes later. The machine keeps printing dollars that are not quite dollars, backed by assets that are not quite cash, run by people who will never be invited to Davos, and somehow it all just works. Maybe one day the audit will never come, the reserves will prove thinner than advertised, the Bitcoin position will blow up, and the redemptions will overwhelm the banking partners. Maybe. Or maybe twenty years from now graduate students will write papers trying to explain how an offshore token with no real regulator became one of the most important pieces of financial infrastructure on earth, hated by everyone who mattered and loved by everyone who needed it.

Until then the FUD cycle will continue exactly as it always has: a new trigger, a flurry of threads, a brief de-peg to 99.4 cents, mass redemptions that are met in full, and then a quiet return to parity while the critics update their priors one more time.

Tether is not a scandal that got lucky.

Tether is the revelation that, when the lights are off and the regulators are asleep, the market doesn’t want purity. It wants dollars that move at the speed of light, on weekends, without permission, without apologies, or a boarding pass to Manhattan. It wants a shadow dollar that answers to no one and still shows up on time, every single day, for eleven straight years.

And the most subversive truth in modern finance is this:
the world already voted,
and the world chose the dirty token.

That vote is final.
The rest is just noise.

TL;DR on Tether’s financial strength**

Tether only publishes the “reserve” side (what backs the USDT in circulation). They have a separate, unreported equity balance sheet stuffed with profits: equity investments, Bitcoin mining, extra BTC holdings, corporate cash, etc. Excess profits are either reinvested or paid as dividends to shareholders.

- 
Insanely profitable & valuable equity
~$120B in US Treasuries earning ~4–5% → ~$5–6B annual profit (some estimates say $10B+ total liquid PnL) with only ~150 employees. This makes Tether one of the highest-margin businesses on earth. Equity value likely $50–100B (possibly way higher; rumors of trying to raise $20B at 3% stake implying $650B+ valuation, though that’s probably fantasy).

## Conclusion

- 
Better collateralized than most banks
Banks keep only 5–15% in truly liquid assets and lend/invest the rest in far more illiquid stuff. Tether’s disclosed reserves are almost entirely cash + short-term Treasuries (way more liquid and over-collateralized than bank deposits). The big difference: banks have central banks as lender of last resort; Tether doesn’t, but it also has massive excess equity it could sell.

Tether isn’t at risk of going bust; it’s a hyper-efficient money-printing machine sitting on tens of billions in unreported shareholder equity. The real risk isn’t insolvency—it’s regulatory kill-switch or loss of confidence, not lack of assets.
