## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Shiller CAPE Ratio:** A valuation metric that compares stock prices to average earnings over the last decade, adjusted for inflation, to assess market overvaluation.
- **Hype Cycle Awareness:** Understanding the historical context of market bubbles and the risks of investing during periods of excessive optimism.
- **Sector-Specific Investment Focus:** Identifying and investing in sectors with significant potential for growth, such as robotics, while being mindful of associated risks.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Assess the market's current valuations using metrics like the Shiller CAPE ratio to determine if stocks are overpriced. Compare current conditions to historical bubbles to gauge potential future performance. Maintain a long-term perspective, especially in sectors with transformative potential, while being cautious about current valuations and market sentiment.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for signals indicating market corrections, such as rising tariffs, weaker earnings reports, or geopolitical tensions. Recognize the slow grind of market declines rather than expecting abrupt crashes. Identify early-stage companies within promising sectors that are making tangible progress, while being wary of high valuations and cash burn rates.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Apply a disciplined investment strategy that prioritizes sectors poised for long-term growth, like robotics, while avoiding the pitfalls of chasing market trends. Diversify investments across private and public companies to balance risks and rewards. Regularly revisit valuations and market conditions to adjust positions and maintain a defensive posture during overvalued periods.

**Important Notes:**
- Emphasize methodologies for assessing market conditions rather than focusing on outdated numbers.
- Extract actionable insights that can adapt to current market scenarios, promoting a proactive rather than reactive investment strategy.
- Keep the analysis concise and relevant for ongoing investment decision-making.

I’m scrolling through stock charts again, and the Shiller CAPE ratio is sitting around 40. That’s a big warning sign—stocks are very expensive compared to history. We’ve seen this before: the dot-com bubble in 1999 and the highs in 2021. Both times, the market dropped sharply afterward. High valuations like this usually mean low future returns—maybe just 1-2% per year over the next decade, after inflation. But I still believe robotics will change the world. Robots can help with labor shortages, care for the elderly, and work in factories or homes.

The market for humanoid robots could grow hugely in the coming years.

## Context

I’m optimistic long-term, but right now? Prices are too high. 

I’m being careful.

Why the Stock Market Feels Overpriced

## Main

The Shiller CAPE measures stock prices against average earnings over the last 10 years (adjusted for inflation).

- 
Current level: ~40

- 
Historical average: Around 17

- 
Only a few times higher: 1929, 1999, 2021—all followed by big drops

Bulls say “This time is different because of AI!” 

But history shows stories like that don’t always hold up.

Triggers for a pullback could include higher tariffs, weaker company earnings, or global issues. Markets don’t usually crash suddenly—they slowly grind down.

Robotics: The Big Opportunity

Real problems need solving:

- 
Fewer workers in trucking, warehouses, and manufacturing

- 
Aging populations needing help

- 
Defense needs

Market forecasts:

- 
Humanoid robots could grow from a few billion today to $15+ billion by 2030

- 
Some analysts predict trillions long-term, with millions or billions of units

Funding is pouring in, but risks remain: high cash burn at startups, regulations, supply issues, and collecting enough real-world data to train AI.

I’ve learned from past hype cycles—don’t chase crowds.

Private Investments: Exciting but Risky

Private companies offer big potential rewards, but money is locked up and valuations can swing wildly.

I have small positions in a few with real progress:

Figure AI

- 
Raised over $1B in 2025 at ~$39 billion valuation

- 
Testing with BMW, strong AI models

- 
But $39B is huge for early stage—risk of dilution

1X Technologies’ NEO

- 
Pre-orders open: ~$20K to buy or $499/month

- 
Deal for up to 10,000 units in factories/warehouses (2026-2030)

- 
Smart mix of autonomy and remote help while tech improves

Neura Robotics

- 
Raised ~€120M in early 2025

- 
Strong ties to NVIDIA, big order book

- 
Shifting to home and service uses

These are shipping units and gathering data—which helps AI improve fast.

But one mistake, and value can drop quickly.

**Public Stocks: Easier to Buy/Sell, But Spread Out**

Public robotics plays are bits and pieces—no one dominates everything.

Examples: 

Autonomous trucking (Aurora), **sensors (Ouster), 
delivery bots, 
defense, 
batteries, 
NVIDIA (chips). 

Good ideas, but many lose money.

Like the internet boom: tools survived, but full platforms (like Amazon) won big.

Tesla: My Biggest Bet in Robotics**

Tesla stock is around $480-490, market cap ~$1.6 trillion. 

Up nicely this year despite EV challenges.

What excites me: 

Tesla builds everything in-house—sensors, software, batteries, factories.

Optimus is the key robotics play.

Recent progress:

- 
Smoother movement, better hands coming soon

- 
Pilot production now; bigger scale in 2026

- 
Goal: Thousands in factories next year

- 
Target price: $20K-30K per robot

Tesla’s data from cars and robots creates a huge advantage.

Elon Musk says Optimus could be worth trillions someday.

Risks: Delays, competition (especially China), regulations.

But if they execute, Tesla could be like Amazon after the dot-com crash.

**Core portfolio: **

Mostly Bitcoin (no borrowing).

Small slice (~5%) for AI/robotics:

Buy more on dips. Limit risks.

Robotics feels real this time. 

But timing matters.

What do you think?

Are valuations too crazy?
