## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Vertical Integration:** The importance of controlling multiple stages of production and distribution to capture value and create a competitive moat.
- **Infrastructure Lock-in:** Understanding how seamless integration and high switching costs can secure customer loyalty and enhance profitability.
- **Operational Efficiency:** The ability to leverage technology for significant cost savings and improved performance, particularly in scalable environments like cloud computing and AI.
- **Value Capture in Commoditization:** Recognizing the distinction between technology providers and those who actually extract value from the application of that technology in the market.

**Analytical Approach:**
- **Evaluate Value Streams:** Analyze how companies create and capture value through their operational models. Focus on whether they have the means to integrate vertically and how that contributes to their competitive positioning.
- **Assess Market Dynamics:** Look beyond current trends and hype to understand fundamental business models that sustain long-term growth and profitability. This involves questioning who benefits most from technological advancements and market shifts.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Look for Signs of Moat Creation:** Identify companies that are not just innovating but are also building defensible market positions through proprietary technologies, high switching costs, and customer lock-in.
- **Monitor Operational Metrics:** Pay attention to operational efficiency indicators, such as cost reductions, performance improvements, and the scalability of services, which can signal future profitability.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Investment Evaluation Framework:** Apply a checklist to assess investments in technology firms: 
  1. Is there a strong vertical integration strategy?
  2. What are the switching costs for customers?
  3. How does the company leverage its operational capabilities for efficiency?
  4. Who captures the value in the ecosystem—technology providers or end-users?
- **Scenario Planning:** Consider various future scenarios based on changes in technology and market conditions. Evaluate how resilient a company's strategy is under different outcomes, focusing on their ability to adapt and maintain their competitive edge.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

A friend sent me a detailed breakdown of Amazon’s AI moves last week. Solid analysis: Trainium chips getting cheaper and faster, Nova models punching above their weight on price-performance, frontier agents automating the boring parts of enterprise workflows, and a million robots humming away in warehouses. The conclusion? Amazon is undervalued because it’s building “boring but valuable” AI that compounds into real margins, not just demo videos.

He’s right on the facts. AWS re:Invent 2025 delivered exactly that script—Trainium 3 UltraServers now live, Nova 2 family expanding with multimodal and speech capabilities, Nova Forge letting enterprises train private frontier models, and those autonomous agents (Kiro for code, security and DevOps variants) that can run for days without human babysitting.

## Context

But here’s where I pause.

Great Execution, Questionable Moat in a Commodity World
**
Amazon isn’t chasing the spotlight with consumer-facing miracles. It’s doing what it does best: scaling infrastructure, squeezing costs, and locking in enterprises with seamless integration. Trainium 3 on 3nm silicon? Impressive—up to 4.4x performance and 4x efficiency over the last gen, with claims of 30-50% savings versus Nvidia equivalents for big workloads. Early wins with Anthropic prove it’s not vaporware.

AI Factories extend the playbook: ship managed racks (Trainium or Nvidia) straight into customer data centers for sovereignty and low latency. Classic lock-in—once you’re in the AWS ecosystem, switching costs skyrocket.
> 
And robotics? Hitting 1 million deployed units earlier this year, powered by foundation models like DeepFleet that shave 10% off fleet routing times. That’s a decade of proprietary physical-world data no one else has. Real moat.

## Main

The stock reflects none of this hype. Mid-December 2025, AMZN sits around a $2.4 trillion market cap, up only low single digits YTD while AI darlings rotate in and out of favor. Heavy capex ($120B+ trailing) gets digested quietly because the core (e-commerce, ads, AWS) keeps compounding.

If operational AI delivers even half the promised savings—billions in fulfillment efficiencies, faster AWS revenue growth—it rerates higher in 2026. Analysts already whisper 20-30% upside if chip adoption scales.

Fair enough. Amazon survives because it builds things that work at planet scale, without needing narrative oxygen.

Now flip to crypto.

Visa or Ethereum? Stripe or Solana?

We keep telling ourselves crypto infrastructure is the next internet stack. L1s as the rails, tokens capturing value from blockspace commoditization turned into eternal fees.

But look closer.

Who really captures the value when technology normalizes?

In payments: Visa and Stripe win. Not the open protocols.

In cloud: AWS wins. Not the bare-metal providers.

In AI: Who benefits most from cheaper compute and better models?

Enterprises plugging them into workflows. 

Not the open-source trainers or token-gated datasets.

Amazon’s thesis works because it’s vertically integrated. It builds the chips, trains the models, deploys the agents, and reaps the margins internally while selling the surplus to others.

Crypto infrastructure? Fragmented. L1s compete on speed and cost, but value accrues upstream—to apps, stablecoin issuers, enterprises building private chains, or legacy firms layering on top.

Solana screams fast blockspace. Ethereum layers scale. But the FDVs? Eye-watering relative to revenue.
> 
Bitcoin at sub $90k, total market ~$3T in late 2025—impressive exponent, sure. But altcoin seasons come and go, and infrastructure tokens keep leaking value to the application layer.

The Boring Truth About Value Capture**

I believe in the exponent. I believe in technology.

Crypto will become invisible plumbing: stablecoins settling trillions, tokenized assets normalizing, DeFi unit economics finally beating TradFi on margins.

But who gets paid?

Not the base layer holders, mostly.

Circle and Tether print dollars. BlackRock and Fidelity wrap Bitcoin. Enterprises run private validators or hybrid setups.

Amazon captures because it owns the stack end-to-end.

Crypto’s open nature commoditizes the bottom. That’s the feature—and the bug.

Patience is the edge here. 

Skepticism keeps you alive long enough to collect when the real adoption hits.

Where I’m Positioned

Mostly Bitcoin and cash. Small bets on things with actual PMF in payments and RWAs. No leverage. No moonshot infrastructure bags at 100x revenue multiples. Amazon might indeed rerate on its unsexy AI grind. Good for them.

## Conclusion

In crypto, the unsexy winners are the ones that survive the resets.

Good luck out there.
