## Analogies and Emerging Opportunities

The user's comparisons highlight undervalued stocks with parallels to past tech giants. Based on company profiles and 2026 analyses:

- **$TE** (TeraWulf? Context: Battery tech with EOSE, FLNC): Likely TeraWulf (WULF, but listed as TE), a clean energy miner pivoting to AI infrastructure. 2026 outlook: Strong revenue growth from AI data centers, but high volatility due to energy costs.
- **$IREN** (Iris Energy): Bitcoin miner turned AI cloud provider. Analysts project 151% revenue growth in 2026 to $3.4B, driven by Microsoft contract and GPU expansion to 140,000 units.
- **$NBIS** (Nebius Group): AI cloud and compute leader. Forecasts show 521% revenue surge to $3.45B in 2026, with ARR targets of $7-9B by year-end. Nvidia investment bolsters position.
- **$OSS** (One Stop Systems): AI edge computing specialist. Expected 169% sales growth in 2026, but remains speculative with execution risks.
- **$ASTS** (AST SpaceMobile): Satellite-to-phone connectivity. 311% sales growth projected for 2026 to $235M, fueled by partnerships like Verizon.
- **$ONDS** (Ondas Holdings): Defense drones and communications. Raised 2026 revenue guidance to $170-180M, up 46% YOY.
- **$KRKNF** (Kraken Robotics): Marine tech with defense applications. $35M battery orders signal 2026 growth, but OTC status adds risk.

These picks align with "buying the future" themes, offering high-upside exposure to AI, space, and defense.
