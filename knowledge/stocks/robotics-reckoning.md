It’s 4 a.m. on December 17, 2025, and I’m refreshing Shiller CAPE data one last time. The numbers are stark: around 40. This is only the third time in 154 years we’ve hit this level—the dot-com peak in ‘99, the pandemic surge in ‘21, and now.

Those past highs were followed by big drops: ~49% after the first, ~25% after the second. We’re already feeling the pressure this time around.

## Context

**The Market’s Unforgiving Math**

The stock market is trading at about 2.3 times its long-term average valuation—cheaper than today in only ~1% of historical periods.

Vanguard’s data over the past century shows a strong link between high CAPE and lower future returns (correlation ~0.43). At levels over 40, expected real annual returns through 2035 are around 1.6%. That’s not a crash tomorrow, but slow erosion of gains.

## Main

Gravity in markets works gradually... until it doesn’t. Triggers could be anything in this “priced for perfection” environment: tariffs, tighter credit, earnings misses, or geopolitical flares.

I’ve lived through bubbles before—selling too early, holding losers too long, watching portfolios shrink. These days, as a quiet angel investor, I stack positions carefully while dissecting charts over coffee.

**Why Robotics Still Excites Me**

Despite the market caution, robotics has real tailwinds:

- 
Severe labor shortages (e.g., trucking drivers disappearing, warehouses understaffed)

- 
Straining power grids from data centers

- 
Rising defense spending amid tensions

- 
Aging populations needing care

Market projections vary, but growth is clear:

- 
GlobalData: $90B today to $205B by 2030 (15% CAGR)

- 
Others range from $50-73B now to $111-185B by 2030

Humanoids, exoskeletons, and drones are the fastest-growing segments.

Risks are real: high burn rates, regulations, supply chains, and stretched valuations in this era.

My Private Bets

I’ve invested early in privates with strong conviction:

- 
Figure AI: Raised over $1B in Series C (September 2025) at ~$39B post-money. Huge jump from prior rounds. Pilots with BMW, advancing Helix AI.

- 
1X Technologies: NEO home robot preorders opened (October 2025)—$20k outright or $499/month subscription. Sleeker design, partnerships for thousands of units ‘26-’30, pivoting to consumer.

- 
Neura Robotics: Talks of major funding (Tether-led ~$1B) pushing valuation to €8-10B. Expanding cognitive features, industrial roots to home.

Privates are illiquid—dilution and hype risks loom in high-valuation times. I size cautiously but believe in shipping progress (early data feeding AI improvements).

Public Plays

Public robotics stocks are fragmented:

- 
Autonomy: Aurora (trucking miles, safety record but big losses)

- 
Sensors: Ouster (lidar shipping, margins improving)

- 
Delivery: Serve (sidewalk bots exploding with Uber ties)

- 
Defense: AeroVironment/Kratos (backlogs growing)

- 
Batteries/Energy: Solid Power/Eos

- 
Medical: PROCEPT (precision robotics for aging demographics)

- 
GPUs: NVIDIA (powering it all)

These offer upside in niches but are mostly pre-profit, volatile, with execution risks. Elon Musk’s old advice resonates: Buy products/services you love. Hold if fundamentals improve. Don’t panic on dips.

Why I’m Tilting Toward Tesla

Stands out as the vertical integrator capturing the broadest robotics exposure:

- 
Own sensors (cameras/radar)

- 
In-house software (FSD v14: zero-intervention hauls, driverless tests in Austin—no occupants, fleet growing)

- 
Batteries (compounding margins even as EV growth slows)

- 
Robotaxi expansion (app downloads surging)

- 
Optimus (jogging in labs, Gen 3 prototypes soon, targets $20-30k, internal thousands in ‘26)

> 
Stock around $475-490 mid-December (YTD ~18-25%, nearing records despite EV headwinds from competition/tariffs). Market cap >$1.6T—pricing in big autonomy/Optimus success. Analysts mixed: consensus ~$390-400, bulls to $530-600+. Past regrets: Spreading too thin across themes, missing compounders like vertical stacks. 

Tesla could falter (EV slowdowns, regs), or privates/publics could multibag. But deepest conviction here: data flywheel + manufacturing scale. I hold privates for momentum, nibble defense/sensor publics. Heavier Tesla tilt. No all-ins.Broad market arithmetic suggests ~10% decade returns unlikely at these vals. Diversify, stay cautious—perfection is fragile.

Lessons from scars: Bet profoundly where conviction is strongest. Study filings obsessively. Crowds are wrong at extremes.

Dawn’s coming. Coffee’s brewing. Staying vigilant amid the gravity—believing in enduring products through the reckoning. 

Quick Snapshot (as of mid-Dec 2025—always verify latest):

- 
Privates: Figure ~$39B, 1X (NEO preorders live), Neura (€8-10B talks)

- 
TSLA: ~$475-490, analysts $390-600 range; keys: FSD, Robotaxi, Optimus

- 
Publics: Higher-risk niche upside

## Conclusion

Quietly recalibrating as gravity rhymes with history. 

Belief holds if products keep improving.
