If you’re thinking about upgrading your PC’s memory as a little post-holiday treat to yourself, I have some bad news: you might want to sit down.

Right now, a decent 64GB DDR5 kit (2x32GB, something like 6000MT/s) is retailing for $600–$900, depending on the brand and RGB bling. Some premium models are pushing past $1,000. That’s not a typo. We’re talking about two sticks of RAM—bare components—that cost as much as (or more than) a base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s latest M5 chip, 16GB of unified memory, and a full laptop wrapped around it.

## Context

How did we get here?

The culprit, as you’ve probably guessed, is AI. 

Not in some abstract “tech hype” way, but in the very concrete form of insatiable demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and server-grade DRAM from data centers training and running massive models. 

## Main

Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron—the three companies that control over 90% of the global DRAM market—have redirected huge chunks of their production capacity toward these ultra-profitable AI chips. HBM alone consumes roughly three times the wafer space per gigabyte compared to standard DDR5, meaning fewer “regular” chips make it to the consumer market.

The result? Spot prices for DDR5 chips have quadrupled in places since September. Contract prices jumped 80–100% month-over-month in December alone. Retail kits that were $200–250 earlier this year are now triple that or more. Even DDR4 has been dragged upward, though not quite as brutally.

PC builders are feeling the pain acutely. CyberPowerPC announced price hikes across their systems starting in December, citing a 500% surge in RAM costs. Framework stopped selling standalone laptop RAM to prevent scalping. Some stores have removed price tags entirely and are quoting on request. 

On eBay, opportunistic sellers are flipping kits for $2,000+.

And the kicker: analysts don’t expect meaningful relief until late 2026 at the earliest—possibly stretching into 2027 or 2028 as new fabs slowly come online. TrendForce and others are forecasting sharp increases continuing into Q1 2026, with PC prices potentially rising 4–8% overall just to absorb the memory hit.

Meanwhile, Apple’s ecosystem looks almost smug by comparison. Their unified memory is soldered and has always been pricey per gigabyte, but right now? A new MacBook Pro starts at around $1,599 with 16GB (often discounted to ~$1,400–1,500). You get a stunning display, incredible battery life, and performance that punches way above its weight. 

Upgrading to higher unified memory configs is expensive, sure—but you’re not staring at a naked RAM kit that’s suddenly worth more than a PlayStation 5 Pro.

This isn’t just a PC builder’s headache. It’s rippling through laptops, phones, and even consoles. Smartphone makers are reportedly considering dropping back to 4GB base configs to keep prices sane. The entire consumer electronics food chain is getting squeezed because three companies decided AI margins were sexier than feeding the rest of us.

## Conclusion

If you’re in the market for a new machine right now, the calculus has flipped. Buying a complete system (especially one with soldered memory) might actually be the rational choice over building or upgrading piecemeal. 

Stock up if you can find old inventory, hoard what you have, or just... wait. A lot of us are waiting. Happy holidays, everyone. May your framerates be high and your RAM prices eventually, someday, come back down to earth.
