It’s November 22, 2025, and if you squint at the financial headlines, you might mistake the market for a rerun of 2022’s crypto winter. Bitcoin, that perennial rebel of the asset class, has clawed its way to an all-time high of $126,270 back in early October, only to tumble 33% to around $84,700 today—erasing every scrap of its 2025 gains and dipping into official bear territory.

ETF outflows have hit $903 million in a single day, institutional whales like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy are nursing leveraged wounds (down 43% from their peaks despite stacking more sats), and the chatter on X is a cacophony of “bear market confirmed” laments.

## Context

Yet, amid this digital gold-plated panic, something far more telling is unfolding in the stock market: the very titans of tech—Oracle, Palantir, Meta, AMD, Tesla, Netflix, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, and Broadcom—have already lapped Bitcoin in the race to the bottom. Their declines from record highs aren’t just corrections; they’re a stark signal that the AI-fueled euphoria of early 2025 has curdled into a full-blown hangover, and it’s hitting harder than crypto’s volatility ever could.

Let’s peel back the layers on this top-tier lineup, because the numbers don’t lie, but they do whisper uncomfortable truths. Oracle, the enterprise software stalwart, leads the pack in self-inflicted pain with a 39% plunge from its September peak of $327.76. What started as a banner year—up nearly 70% year-to-date on cloud deals and AI database hype—unraveled as competition from Microsoft Azure and AWS exposed Oracle’s slower pivot to generative AI. Earnings growth flatlined in Q2, and whispers of overpromised AI integrations turned investor patience into outright exodus.

Palantir, the data analytics darling that rocketed 172% over the year on government contracts and AI platform buzz, has shed 25% from its November high. It’s a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news”: post-earnings profit-taking collided with valuation jitters (trading at 61x sales pre-drop), leaving it vulnerable to the broader tech rotation.

## Main

Meta and AMD, both down 25% and 23% respectively, embody the sector’s interconnected fragility. Meta’s August ATH of $789 came on ad revenue surges and metaverse bets paying off modestly, but a 3% Q3 earnings miss amid rising capex (up 108% to $17 billion) for AI infrastructure spooked the Street. Investors fled as Zuckerberg’s long-game vision clashed with short-term yield spikes from Treasury data. AMD mirrored this, peaking at $264 in late October on chip demand, only to crater on whispers of Nvidia dominance and a broader semis slowdown—its 24% yearly gain now feels like a cruel tease.

Tesla, ever the volatility king, is off 20% from its $488 high, hammered by a 34% YTD slide tied to EV market saturation, tariff threats under Trump 2.0, and a Q3 delivery miss that erased Q4 2024’s doubling act.

Netflix holds at a 22% drawdown, resilient on subscriber adds but punished for content cost overruns in a streaming wars redux.

Then there’s the “Magnificent” core: Nvidia’s mere 14% dip from $207 masks its 26% yearly surge, buoyed by 18.4% Q3 earnings growth across the group, while Amazon (15% off), Microsoft (13% off), and Broadcom (12% off) cling to double-digit yearly returns through diversified AI bets—Amazon’s AWS disappointment notwithstanding.

**Compare this to Bitcoin’s woes, and the irony sharpens. **

BTC’s 33% slide isn’t born of fundamentals like earnings whiffs; it’s pure sentiment and leverage. Spot ETFs ballooned to $165 billion in assets earlier this year on post-halving hype and Trump’s crypto-reserve rhetoric, propelling the rally. But October’s 13% single-day plunge—triggered by yen carry trade unwinds and Mt. Gox repayments—cascaded into leverage liquidations, with 33% of supply now underwater (echoing September 2024 lows). X threads buzz with “death cross” fears and predictions of $40k-$50k by 2026 end, yet historical cycles suggest this is just the “refueling phase” before another leg up—average post-halving ATH is 500 days away, and we’re only midway. Crypto’s pain is acute but familiar: a 76% drawdown in 2022, yet it rebounded 114% YTD into late 2024.

Tech stocks? Their declines feel structural, tied to ballooning capex (Meta’s $85 billion for 2025, up 60%) and macro headwinds like August’s PPI miss and rising yields chasing risk out of growth names.

This divergence isn’t coincidence; it’s convergence of overreach. The past year was AI’s fever dream: Nvidia’s chips, Microsoft’s Copilot, Amazon’s custom silicon—all riding the generative wave to trillion-dollar valuations. But as Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone warned in August, 2025 was always primed for a “down year,” with crypto and tech as volatility’s canaries.

Trump’s tariffs and Fed pauses amplified the rotation to bonds and gold (up 32% vs. BTC since 2021 peaks), while tech’s “Magnificent Seven” posted just 18.4% Q3 growth—their weakest since 2023. X sentiment echoes this: traders decry altcoin caps at four-year lows, Bitcoin treasuries like Metaplanet down 76%, and a “330,000-player game of musical chairs.”

Yet, buried in the noise, resilient threads emerge—Nvidia’s post-earnings bounce lifted peers like AMD 4%, hinting at sector rotation, not rout.

So, what does this mean for the investor staring down December’s barrel? First, humility: these 20-40% drawdowns are table stakes in tech and crypto; Brew Markets charts show the Mag Seven averaging -10% to -18% YTD, with Tesla at -35%. Bitcoin’s “digital gold” sheen is tarnished, lagging even T-bills, but its scarcity narrative endures—33% supply at loss screams capitulation buy, not collapse.

Tech’s wounds run deeper: Oracle’s cloud lag and Palantir’s valuation stretch suggest selective pain, favoring diversified giants like Microsoft over pure-play AI bets. The real bear test? If BTC tests $75k (April’s low) without rebounding, or if Q4 earnings reveal AI ROI as vaporware.

In the end, this isn’t 2022 redux—it’s 2025’s recalibration. Tech entered the bear first because its highs were built on promises, not protocols; Bitcoin bleeds because it’s still the asset class’s emotional core. But history favors the patient: post-20% corrections birthed 50% rebounds for these names. As one X sage quipped amid the wicks and liquidations, “We’re not trading Bitcoin anymore—we’re in a game where the chairs are on fire.” True enough. The fire’s lit, but the exits are wide open for those who spot the sparks of recovery amid the smoke.

## Conclusion

Load up on the dips, stack your sats, and remember: bears hibernate.

Bulls? They charge come spring.
