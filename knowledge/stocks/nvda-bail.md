AI firing on all cylinders, GPUs the backbone of it all. Margins fat as a whale wallet, demand bottomless, competitors fumbling in the dark.

Peter Thiel—that contrarian with a nose for bullshit—dropped the hammer. His fund wiped its slate clean of NVDA last quarter, every share out the door.

## Context

NVDA’s riding high, up solid YTD, market cap puffed to trillions. P/E stretched thin, earnings solid but priced like perfection’s locked in.

Revenue’s exploding, backlogs stretching far, bulls preaching eternal moats.

But here’s the wake-up.

## Main

It’s fading, subtle like inflation nibbling your purchasing power. AMD’s stepped up—no more easy laughs. Their latest chips match NVDA’s muscle, edge it on efficiency, cutting costs where it hurts.

That software lock-in? A band-aid in a rush to open everything up.

The real kicker’s Big Tech flipping the script with custom gear. Google built their big model entirely on house chips—no NVDA needed. That move lit up their stock, proving efficiency wins in those energy-guzzling farms. Amazon’s right behind, shifting workloads to their own silicon, scaling massive.

Not prototypes; this is the shift killing premiums.

## Conclusion

Maybe I’m off, but history’s a harsh teacher.

> Electricity changed everything, then turned commodity—profits dulled to nothing special. Phones did the same, hardware got cheap, value flowed to the apps sucking your data. AI chips? Following suit.

Don’t twist it, I’m not bearish on AI, but the smart money’s in the stacked players dodging the traps. Google’s efficiency edge pumping their cloud. Microsoft’s mashups, Amazon’s alliances—they own the layers, so maybe dial NVDA back to a sliver, and lean a bit more into the integrators: Google for the smart cuts, Amazon grinding inference, Microsoft holding the web. And survive the turns.
