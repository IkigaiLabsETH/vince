# Commodity Supercycle Thesis

## Methodology & Framework

### Core Concepts

Commodity supercycles are decades-long periods of above-trend price appreciation driven by structural demand shifts meeting constrained supply. Historical supercycles lasted 15-25 years: the 1900s-1920s (industrialization), 1930s-1950s (war/rebuilding), 1960s-1980s (inflation/oil shocks), and 2000s-2010s (China urbanization). The thesis: we're in the early innings of a new supercycle driven by energy transition, reshoring, defense spending, and chronic underinvestment in extraction capacity.

### Analytical Approach

**Supercycle identification requires three conditions:**

1. **Structural demand shift**: A multi-decade force increasing commodity consumption (electrification, AI data centers, defense buildouts, emerging market urbanization)
2. **Supply underinvestment**: Years of low capex in mining and extraction creating supply deficits that take 5-10 years to resolve (permitting timelines, declining ore grades, ESG-restricted capital)
3. **Monetary backdrop**: Expansionary fiscal policy, financial repression, or currency debasement that supports nominal price increases

Measure the capex-to-depreciation ratio for major miners and energy producers. When this ratio stays below 1.0 for extended periods, it signals future supply constraints. Track discovery rates for new deposits — declining discovery despite rising exploration spend signals geological depletion of easy reserves.

### Pattern Recognition

- **Early supercycle (years 1-5)**: Prices rise from distressed levels, mining equities outperform commodities, skepticism is high — "it's just a bounce"
- **Mid supercycle (years 5-12)**: Supply constraints become obvious, prices exceed prior cycle highs, capex ramps but new supply takes years — mainstream acceptance
- **Late supercycle (years 12-20)**: Demand destruction begins at margin, substitution accelerates, new supply from capex cycle starts arriving, speculative excess
- **Supercycle indicators**: Rising commodity/equity ratios, falling inventory-to-consumption ratios, backwardation across multiple commodity curves simultaneously

### Decision Framework

**Which commodities benefit most in current setup:**

1. **Copper**: Electrification bottleneck — EVs use 4x more copper than ICE vehicles, grid buildout massive, supply pipeline thin. The "new oil."
2. **Uranium**: Nuclear renaissance for baseload clean energy, supply deficit after decade of underinvestment post-Fukushima
3. **Silver**: Dual industrial/monetary demand — solar panels consuming growing share of mine supply while investment demand rises
4. **Lithium/rare earths**: Battery supply chain, though watch for substitution and recycling reducing long-term scarcity
5. **Oil/gas**: Still essential during transition, underinvestment means supply won't meet demand for decades

**Crypto intersection:**
Commodity supercycles are inflationary by nature — rising input costs flow through to consumer prices. This environment supports the BTC inflation-hedge narrative and benefits commodity-linked tokens/protocols. More importantly, rising energy costs reshape PoW mining geography and economics, favoring miners with stranded/cheap energy access.

Mining equities and commodity producers also correlate with crypto in risk-on environments — they share the "real assets over financial assets" trade. A commodity supercycle supports the broader rotation from financial assets to real/hard assets, a theme that benefits BTC as "digital commodity."

**Key principle**: Supercycles reward patience and conviction. The biggest gains come from early positioning before consensus forms. Track supply-side fundamentals, not price action — supply deficits are structural and don't resolve quickly regardless of price signals.
