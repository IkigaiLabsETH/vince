# Oil as Macro Signal

## Methodology & Framework

### Core Concepts
Oil is the master commodity — its price encodes global growth expectations, geopolitical risk, and monetary conditions simultaneously. Rising oil prices act as a tax on consumers and a subsidy to producers, redistributing global capital flows. The petrodollar system links oil pricing to USD demand, creating feedback loops between energy markets, currency markets, and by extension, crypto.

For crypto specifically, oil affects two channels: mining economics (energy cost is the primary input for PoW mining) and risk appetite (oil shocks historically trigger recession fears that crush speculative assets).

### Analytical Approach
**Oil price regime classification:**
- **$40-60 (low)**: Signals demand weakness or oversupply — deflationary, risk of producer stress, generally risk-off but cheap energy helps miners
- **$60-90 (goldilocks)**: Healthy global demand, manageable inflation contribution — best environment for risk assets including crypto
- **$90-120 (stress)**: Inflation fears rise, central banks tighten, consumer spending squeezed — mixed for crypto (inflation hedge narrative vs. risk-off pressure)
- **$120+ (crisis)**: Demand destruction imminent, recession risk spikes — bearish risk assets, including crypto

Watch the crude oil futures curve shape: backwardation (front month > back months) signals tight physical supply and current demand strength. Contango (front < back) signals oversupply or demand weakness. The steepness matters more than the absolute price for macro signaling.

### Pattern Recognition
- **OPEC cuts into weak demand**: Signals floor under prices but confirms demand weakness — bearish risk assets medium-term
- **OPEC cuts into stable demand**: Bullish commodities, inflationary, watch for central bank response
- **Surprise OPEC production increases**: Geopolitical signal (usually Saudi signaling displeasure or seeking market share) — short-term bearish oil, complex second-order effects
- **Oil spike + USD strength**: Classic risk-off — very bearish crypto
- **Oil spike + USD weakness**: Supply-driven inflation — mixed for crypto, supports hard-asset narrative
- **Oil decline + USD weakness**: Goldilocks for risk assets — bullish crypto

### Decision Framework
**Petrodollar dynamics and crypto intersection:**

Oil-exporting nations accumulate USD reserves from energy sales, recycling them into US Treasuries and Western assets. As de-dollarization accelerates (bilateral agreements in yuan, rupee, etc.), this recycling weakens, reducing demand for USD and Treasuries. This structural shift is long-term bullish for non-sovereign stores of value including BTC.

**Mining cost transmission:**
Energy prices flow through to BTC mining economics with a ~2-3 month lag. Rising energy costs squeeze marginal miners, reducing hashrate growth and potentially concentrating mining. Falling energy costs expand mining profitability, attracting new entrants. Track the energy cost per BTC mined vs. BTC price — when cost approaches price, expect miner capitulation selling.

**Trading signals from oil:**
1. Oil breaking above 200-day MA with rising volume → growth acceleration, check if crypto follows with lag
2. Oil/gold ratio rising → growth optimism over fear, bullish risk assets
3. Oil/copper ratio falling → oil oversupplied relative to industrial demand, watch for demand signals
4. Crack spreads (refining margins) collapsing → demand destruction underway, get defensive

**Key principle**: Oil is a leading indicator for the liquidity and growth environment that crypto needs to thrive. Ignore oil at your peril — it's the real economy's heartbeat.
