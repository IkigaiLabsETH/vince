# Inflation Hedging Framework

## Methodology & Framework

### Core Concepts

Inflation erodes purchasing power of nominal assets (cash, bonds, fixed annuities) while potentially benefiting real assets (commodities, real estate, equities with pricing power). However, not all "inflation hedges" work in all inflation regimes. The critical distinction: **demand-pull inflation** (growth-driven, rising wages) vs. **cost-push inflation** (supply shocks, stagflation) vs. **monetary inflation** (currency debasement, fiscal dominance). Each regime favors different hedges.

### Analytical Approach

**Hedge effectiveness by inflation type:**

| Hedge       | Demand-Pull | Cost-Push/Stagflation | Monetary Debasement |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| TIPS        | Good        | Moderate              | Good                |
| Gold        | Moderate    | Excellent             | Excellent           |
| BTC         | Good        | Poor-Mixed            | Excellent           |
| Real Estate | Excellent   | Moderate              | Good                |
| Commodities | Good        | Excellent             | Good                |
| Equities    | Good        | Poor                  | Moderate            |

TIPS protect against measured CPI but suffer from duration risk when real yields rise. They hedge reported inflation, not necessarily experienced inflation. Gold responds to real yield declines and fear — it's the best hedge when trust in institutions erodes. BTC hedges monetary debasement aggressively but requires liquidity to function; in liquidity crises (which often accompany stagflation), BTC fails as a hedge.

### Pattern Recognition

- **CPI rising + rates rising slower**: Financial repression — gold and BTC outperform, TIPS decent, real estate benefits from negative real mortgage rates
- **CPI rising + rates rising faster**: Volcker-style tightening — cash/short-duration wins, everything else suffers initially, gold struggles until pivot
- **CPI rising + rates falling**: Panic/accommodation — all hard assets rally aggressively
- **Sticky inflation + slowing growth**: Stagflation — commodities and gold best, BTC and equities suffer, TIPS moderate
- **Asset inflation without CPI**: QE-style — equities and BTC soar, gold moderate, commodities lag, real estate booms

### Decision Framework

**Building an inflation-resistant portfolio:**

**Layer 1 — Direct inflation protection (20-30% of portfolio):**

- TIPS ladder (5-10%): Mechanical CPI protection, low vol, liquidity
- Commodity exposure (10-15%): Broad basket via futures or producers — direct input cost hedge
- Gold (5-10%): Insurance against tail scenarios and institutional distrust

**Layer 2 — Real asset growth (30-40%):**

- Real estate/REITs (15-20%): Rental income adjusts with inflation, leveraged position benefits from debt debasement. Prefer assets with short lease durations for faster inflation pass-through
- Equities with pricing power (15-20%): Companies that raise prices faster than costs rise — resource producers, essential services, monopolies/oligopolies

**Layer 3 — Asymmetric monetary hedge (10-20%):**

- BTC (5-15%): Hedge against monetary regime change, currency crises, fiscal dominance. Size as a call option, not a core holding — high vol means it can drawdown 50-80% even in inflationary environments
- Gold miners (5%): Leveraged gold exposure with operational upside

**Layer 4 — Liquidity and optionality (10-20%):**

- Short-duration Treasuries or money market: Dry powder for rebalancing during drawdowns
- Cash in strong currencies if domestic currency at risk

**When each hedge works best:**

- **Gold**: Real yields declining, geopolitical stress, central bank buying, de-dollarization
- **BTC**: Liquidity expanding, monetary base growing, currency crises in EM, post-halving supply squeezes
- **Real estate**: Low/negative real rates, population growth, supply constraints, long inflationary periods
- **TIPS**: Steady above-trend CPI, stable real yields, moderate inflation without crisis
- **Commodities**: Supply shocks, supercycle dynamics, war/conflict, underinvestment catching up

**Key principle**: No single asset hedges all inflation types. Portfolio construction matters more than asset selection. Rebalance between hedges as the inflation regime shifts — the mix that works in demand-pull won't work in stagflation. Monitor real yields as the master variable: falling real yields benefit nearly all inflation hedges simultaneously.
