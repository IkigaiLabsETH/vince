# Gold-BTC Correlation Analysis

## Methodology & Framework

### Core Concepts

Gold and Bitcoin share the "hard money" narrative but respond to fundamentally different market mechanics. Gold is driven by real yields, central bank purchases, and geopolitical fear. Bitcoin is driven by liquidity cycles, halving supply shocks, and speculative risk appetite. The "digital gold" narrative strengthens during monetary debasement periods but breaks down during liquidity crises when BTC trades as a risk asset.

### Analytical Approach

Track the rolling 90-day correlation between gold and BTC. Correlation regimes matter more than point-in-time readings:

- **High positive correlation (>0.6)**: Both responding to monetary debasement fears — bullish macro for hard assets
- **Decorrelation (-0.2 to 0.2)**: Normal state — each driven by idiosyncratic factors
- **Negative correlation (<-0.3)**: Regime stress — usually BTC selling off as risk asset while gold catches safe-haven flows

Key divergence signals: when gold breaks to new highs while BTC lags, it typically signals institutional/sovereign fear (geopolitical risk, sanctions risk) rather than retail speculation. When BTC leads gold, it signals liquidity-driven risk-on with hard-money characteristics.

### Pattern Recognition

- **Real yields falling + USD weakening**: Both assets rally, correlation rises
- **Real yields falling + USD strengthening**: Gold rallies on fear, BTC choppy — watch for divergence
- **Liquidity crisis (VIX spike >30)**: Gold holds or rallies, BTC sells off with equities — correlation breaks negative
- **Post-halving year 1-2**: BTC outperforms gold significantly as supply shock meets demand
- **Central bank buying cycles**: Gold outperforms on sovereign accumulation (China, Russia, emerging markets de-dollarizing)

### Decision Framework

**Portfolio allocation between gold and BTC depends on regime:**

1. **Monetary expansion / early cycle**: Overweight BTC (3:1 BTC:gold) — liquidity tailwind amplifies BTC's beta
2. **Late cycle / geopolitical stress**: Balanced (1:1) — gold provides downside protection BTC won't
3. **Active crisis / liquidity crunch**: Overweight gold (1:3) — BTC correlates with risk assets in crashes
4. **Stagflation**: Both valuable but gold more reliable — BTC needs liquidity to perform, gold doesn't

Monitor the gold/BTC ratio for mean reversion trades. Extreme readings (>40 oz gold per BTC or <15 oz) tend to revert over 6-12 month periods.

**Key principle**: BTC is a call option on monetary debasement with equity-like vol. Gold is insurance against systemic risk with bond-like vol. They complement, not substitute. The "digital gold" framing is useful for narrative but misleading for portfolio construction — treat them as distinct allocations serving different purposes.
