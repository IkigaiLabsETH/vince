- **Volume Migration Signals:** Look for signs of increasing onchain trading volumes in options and tokenized assets, which may indicate a broader acceptance and adoption of these products.
- **Regulatory Developments:** Pay attention to regulatory changes that could facilitate the introduction and growth of new trading instruments in the crypto space.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Scenario Planning:** Develop multiple scenarios based on potential market shifts, such as increased adoption of options or tokenized assets, and strategize accordingly.
- **Investment Diversification:** Consider diversifying trading strategies to include options and tokenized assets, leveraging their asymmetric payoff structures.
- **Market Positioning:** Position within the onchain ecosystem to capitalize on expected growth trends, ensuring that strategies align with evolving market dynamics.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

For the past five years, the crypto derivatives market has been a one-product show. Perpetual futures, those elegant, never-expiring, funding-rate-balanced instruments born on BitMEX and perfected on Binance, dYdX, GMX, and Hyperliquid, have consistently accounted for 85-95% of all onchain derivatives volume. In 2025 they still print close to two trillion dollars of notional turnover every single month. They are simple, highly leverageable, and perfectly suited to a market that has spent most of its life being either euphoric or terrified. 

Perps won the first decade of crypto trading because crypto needed a casino more than it needed a capital market.

## Context

But the casino phase is ending.

The numbers from traditional finance are now so lopsided that they demand a complete re-evaluation of what onchain markets can become. Global equity spot trading alone moves roughly half a quadrillion dollars a year. Equity and index options add another ten to fifteen trillion in annual notional. Real estate, the largest asset class on the planet, sits on three hundred trillion dollars of illiquid value and changes hands for another sixteen to twenty trillion annually once you include mortgage origination and secondary debt trading. 

Perpetual futures in traditional finance? They barely exist. Even after Singapore Exchange and CME launched regulated crypto perps in 2025, their combined daily notional is still measured in hundreds of millions, not tens of billions. TradFi has already voted with its order book, and the verdict is brutal for the perpetual narrative: linear, symmetric, high-leverage instruments are a niche.

## Main

Asymmetric payoff structures and tokenized ownership of real things are the main event.This is the great onchain inversion that is now underway.

Start with options. In traditional finance, options volume has grown faster than the underlying equities for three consecutive years, driven almost entirely by retail and by the explosive popularity of zero-days-to-expiration contracts. The notional traded in U.S. listed equity and index options alone is approaching ten trillion dollars a year, and the open interest regularly clears a third of a trillion.
> 
Onchain options, by contrast, still scrape together only a few billion dollars of daily volume. The gap is not five times or ten times; it is three orders of magnitude. Even a modest convergence toward TradFi ratios would take onchain options volume from three billion a day to three hundred billion a day. That single migration would make perpetuals look like the sideshow they are destined to become.

The same logic applies, with even more force, to real-world assets. Tokenized equities are still in the low tens of billions of cumulative notional traded since the first experiments began. Tokenized real estate has perhaps twenty billion dollars of assets under management if one is generous and includes every over-enthusiastic press release. Yet the addressable markets are measured in hundreds of trillions. A mere one percent tokenization of global equities would be 1.3 trillion dollars. One percent of global real estate would be three trillion. Reach five percent and the numbers start to look surreal. These are not 2035 fantasies; Tiger Research, Fireblocks, and Standard Chartered all cluster around one to three trillion dollars of tokenized equities alone by 2030, with real estate likely adding another three to ten trillion on top.

What makes these projections feel conservative rather than aggressive is the structural advantage that blockchain native markets possess once the regulatory and oracle scaffolding is in place. Traditional equity markets close at 4 p.m. and settle T+1 or T+2. Tokenized equities trade 24/7 and settle in seconds. Traditional real estate requires lawyers, notaries, title insurance, and months of friction. Tokenized real estate lets a farmer in Nigeria own 0.1% of a Miami apartment building and receive daily rent in USDC with a total expense ratio measured in basis points, not percentage points. Traditional options require a broker, margin approval, and exercise headaches. Onchain options can be fully collateralized, cash-settled, and composable with lending markets from day one.

Perpetual futures have no such structural edge in a world that already has spot markets and dated futures. Their killer feature, no expiry, is only killer when the underlying asset itself has no real-world cash flows and no natural holders. Bitcoin and Ether fit that description in 2018. Apple, BlackRock ETFs, and Manhattan rental apartments do not. Once the underlying starts paying dividends or rent, the perpetual’s funding-rate mechanism becomes a clumsy approximation of a yield that can be captured far more cleanly by simply owning the tokenized asset itself.
> 
The yield story is perhaps the most underappreciated part of the inversion. A tokenized U.S. Treasury or a tokenized rental property pays its coupon or rent directly onchain, every day or every month, without custodian drama. A tokenized stock pays its dividend the same way. An option vault or structured product can be programmed to auto-compound or auto-hedge. None of these things require the perpetual’s endless funding-rate tug-of-war. In a world of real yields, perpetuals are the financial equivalent of renting a car you never intend to return instead of just buying the car and collecting the parking-fee income it generates when you are not driving it.

The timeline is compressing faster than most people realize. Nasdaq filed in September 2025 to run a parallel tokenized order book. BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton are all running tokenized money-market funds that already exceed twenty billion dollars combined. 

Dubai is piloting fully tokenized property deeds. Singapore’s Project Guardian has half a dozen live tokenized real estate funds. Kraken’s xStocks platform did ten billion dollars of cumulative volume in its first six months, mostly from non-U.S. retail investors who cannot open a normal brokerage account. Every month that passes adds another regulated on-ramp, another billion dollars of institutional TVL, another oracle upgrade.

The growth math from here is almost absurdly favorable. Onchain perpetuals would need the crypto market to grow another hundredfold while maintaining their 90% market-share monopoly to keep up with even the conservative tokenized-asset forecasts. Options and RWAs, conversely, need only to capture a tiny sliver of their TradFi equivalents to dwarf everything that crypto has built so far. One percent of TradFi options is a hundred times today’s entire onchain derivatives market. One percent of global real estate is more capital than the current cryptocurrency market cap in its wildest bull run.

The conclusion is no longer speculative. The onchain future will not be a marginally better perpetuals casino layered on top of Bitcoin and Ether. It will be a complete parallel financial system where equities, fixed income, real estate, and asymmetric payoff instruments trade with blockchain-native efficiency.

## Conclusion

Perpetual futures will not disappear; they will simply shrink to their natural size as the high-beta tail hedge they were always meant to be.

The inversion is already in motion. The next ten years do not belong to the instrument that dominated the first ten. They belong to the instruments that dominate the five-hundred-trillion-dollar traditional markets we are finally bringing onchain: real-world assets and options. Everything else is just noise.
