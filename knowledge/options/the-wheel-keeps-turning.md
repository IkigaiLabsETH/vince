I have watched this movie so many times I can mouth the dialogue before the actors open their mouths.Token drops thirty, forty, fifty percent from the all-time high. Unlocks hit. Competitors announce zero-fee perps. Bitcoin dominance spikes. Macro looks dicey. The timeline turns into a slaughterhouse of memes: “dilution forever,” “team dump,” “Lighter ate your lunch,” “dead cat,” “rug.” Fear & Greed prints thirteen. Everyone who bought the top is now an expert on why the project is finished. Everyone who missed the bottom is praying for one more leg down-only candle so they can finally ape.

And every single time, without fail, the protocol keeps printing two, three, sometimes four million dollars a day in cold, hard, onchain revenue. The buyback engine keeps chewing through supply like a slow, relentless wood-chipper. Open interest keeps climbing. Volume keeps climbing. Monthly actives keep climbing. The fundamentals get stronger while the price gets cheaper. And twelve months later the same people who were calling it a rug are posting rocket emojis wondering why they ever sold.

## Context

We are in that exact scene right now with Hyperliquid and its token HYPE. Price is twenty-nine dollars while I type this. Down more than half from the September high. Down twenty-five percent in a month. Down eight percent in a day. The script is identical.

Except this time I am not sweating. I am not refreshing the chart every five minutes. I am not arguing with strangers on the timeline. I am drinking coffee on a Friday afternoon watching weekly options expire worthless while my wallet balance in stablecoins goes up. Because this time I am not just long the token. 

I am long the wheel.**

## Main

We started selling options on Hyperliquid’s native options layer, Hypersurface, at the end of October. Since then the book has been ninety percent HYPE, ten percent BTC, one hundred percent cash-secured puts and covered calls, zero leverage, zero liquidation risk.

The dashboard now reads $6,900 in cumulative premium received, on an average notional that has never once gone above ninety thousand dollars. 

Every Friday for the last ten weeks we have done the same boring thing: 

Wake up. Check that spot is nowhere near our strikes (it almost never is). Watch four, sometimes five weekly options expire worthless. Collect the premium. Immediately sell next week’s batch at even fatter prices because fear is a hell of a drug. Go back to sleep.We have printed sixty percent, seventy percent, one hundred percent annualized in a single week more times than I can count. We have been assigned exactly once, happily bought more HYPE  on the dip, turned around and sold calls against those new shares the following week. Both outcomes are good outcomes. That is the entire point.

Most people still will not touch onchain options with a ten-foot pole. They have their reasons. They remember Opyn. They remember watching their ETH puts turn into worthless oTokens overnight while the team scrambled to pause a “decentralized” protocol. They remember trying to buy a Hegic call in 2021 and giving up after the tenth wallet approval, and the realization that the UI had apparently been designed by someone who had only ever read about options on a forum. They remember opening Lyra for the first time. They remember thinking “I just want to sell a cash-secured put, not solve string theory.”

All of those memories are real. All of those products shipped too early, broke in public, and left scar tissue across the entire category. Onchain options became synonymous with “smart contract risk + nuclear volatility + UX from hell.”

People decided it was safer to just buy the spot bag and pray.

Then Hypersurface showed up and quietly fixed every single one of those problems in a single release.

No multisig pauses. No double-exercise bugs. No approval hell. No vega nightmares. No oracle games. Just an orderbook that feels like Deribit, fills that happen in sub-second time, collateral that never leaves your wallet until settlement, and a UI that looks like it was designed in 2025 instead of 2020. 

You deposit once into a vault, you sell a put or a call with one click, you watch the premium hit your balance instantly, you wake up a week later richer in stables or you ended up buying the dip on auto-pilot.

It is the first onchain options venue that simply works.

And because the timeline is still busy reliving 2021 trauma, implied volatility stays absurdly high, premiums stay absurdly fat, and anyone willing to sell options gets paid like it’s the March 2020 crash every single week.

That is why the wheel on Hypersurface feels like discovering a glitch in the matrix. You are not hoping for a moonshot to make money. You are renting your capital and your conviction to the market at prices you already decided you love. When price dumps, you buy cheaper or collect premium. When price rips, you sell at your target or collect premium. When price chops sideways (which it has done for two straight months), you collect the most premium.

Hyperliquid keeps printing three million a day. The buyback keeps running. The Assistance Fund keeps stacking tokens that will never see daylight again. Open interest on the perp side is higher than every other decentralized venue combined. Permissionless markets are doing half a billion a day in notional. None of that paused because the token price drew down fifteen percent. The only thing that changed is the price got cheaper and the volatility got richer. So we keep doing the boring thing. We keep selling the $27 puts on HYPE when spot is $29. We keep selling $31 calls when spot is flirting with sub $30.

We keep selling $90k puts on BTC when it’s $92k and $94k calls when it’s $90k.

We keep waking up richer every Friday while the timeline argues about things that will not matter in twelve months. We are not trading. We are harvesting panic. The wheel does not care about your narrative. It does not care about unlocks or zero-fee competitors or Bitcoin dominance or the next CPI print. It only cares about two things: time passing and volatility existing. Both are guaranteed in crypto.

So let the tourists puke at twenty-nine. 

Let the perma-bears write their threads. 

Let the macro tourists wait for the Fed pivot. 

Let the yield farmers chase the next ponzi.

The dip is the setup.
The fear is the yield.
The fundamentals are the anchor.
And Hypersurface is the edge.

## Conclusion

The wheel keeps turning.
The yield keeps printing.
The conviction stays boringly, beautifully unchanged.

LFG.
