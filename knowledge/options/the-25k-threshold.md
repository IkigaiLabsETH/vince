We were sitting at one of those tiny marble tables outside Café de Flore, late November, the kind of grey Paris afternoon that makes you order a second café crème just to justify staying longer. Two guys at the table next to us, early thirties, hoodies under cashmere coats, were deep into the eternal French crypto debate. One of them, let’s call him Lucas, had that tired look you only get after three hours with an expert-comptable. He was explaining to his friend why he had just dissolved the SAS he created eighteen months earlier.

“Listen,” he said, lighting another cigarette, “everyone told me the same thing: ‘Create the SAS, kill the cotisation subsidiaire, pay 15 % IS instead of 30 %, deduct the Ledger, the co-working space, the flight to Devcon, everything.’ So I did it. Spent four grand in fees, found an accountant who actually understands on-chain options, opened the bank account at Shine, the whole circus.”

## Context

He exhaled smoke toward the Saint-Germain sky.

“Turns out the math only works when you’re doing twenty-five, maybe thirty thousand euros gross per month, and you’re doing it every single month. Below that, the fixed costs eat you alive: the accountant, the CFE, the bank fees, the URSSAF minimum contributions even when you pay yourself nothing. You still pay 30 % flat tax when you finally distribute the dividends. And if you’re crazy enough to pay yourself a salary to get full CPAM coverage, welcome to forty-five percent social charges.”

His friend laughed. “So you’re telling me the famous French optimisation is a mirage?” “Exactly. For most of us who live off weekly covered calls and secured puts that pays a few thousand euros on a good month, the private individual route is brutally simple and, paradoxically, cheaper. You pay the 30 % flat tax on whatever you realise, you swallow the six or seven thousand euros of cotisation subsidiaire because your revenu fiscal de référence is too high, you keep a private health insurance, and that’s it. No quarterly declarations, no 2065 form, no panic in March when the accountant asks for the CSV of your Hyperliquid trades.” He tapped ash into the ashtray. “I ran the numbers again last week. To end up with the same money in my pocket that I have today as a simple particulier, the SAS would need to generate between 240 and 300 thousand euros gross per year, consistently. That’s the real threshold. Below that, you’re just paying to feel legitimate.”

## Main

The friend raised an eyebrow. “And the guys who brag on Twitter about their SAS?” “Half of them are doing well above thirty grand a month and don’t tell you. The other half are subsidising their ego with their own yield. I know three people who created an SAS to kill the CSM and ended up poorer every month because of the fixed costs. The cotisation subsidiaire hurts, but it’s a known pain. The company is a slow bleed disguised as sophistication.”

A silence fell. The waiter brought two more coffees nobody had ordered; in Paris, that’s how you know the conversation is interesting. Lucas shrugged. “I’m back to being a private individual. I sell a few sats when I need cash, I pay the 30 %, I pay the health penalty, I sleep. When the options desk reliably prints twenty-five or thirty thousand a month, I’ll reopen the SAS in a heartbeat. Until then, I refuse to pay the State to let me pretend I’m a real company.”

He crushed the cigarette, stood up, and left a twenty-euro note under the saucer. We never saw him again, but the conversation stayed with us the rest of the holiday. Somewhere between the Christmas lights on the Champs-Élysées and the vin chaud at the Marché de Noël, we realised that in France, at least in 2025, the most sophisticated tax strategy for a crypto yield farmer is sometimes the oldest one: stay small, stay private, and wait until the activity is large enough that the bureaucracy finally pays for itself.

Everything else is just theatre. 

Beautiful, expensive, Parisian theatre.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Threshold Analysis**: Understanding the income threshold (e.g., €25k) where different operational structures (individual vs. SAS) become financially viable.
- **Cost-Benefit Evaluation**: Weighing the fixed and variable costs of business structures against potential benefits, particularly in the context of crypto trading.
- **Simplicity vs. Complexity**: Recognizing when simpler, more direct methods (individual taxation) may be more advantageous than complex corporate structures (SAS).
- **Market Reality vs. Perception**: Differentiating between perceived success (social media bragging) and actual financial viability.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Evaluate the financial implications of different operational models by conducting thorough cost-benefit analyses. Consider not only immediate tax impacts but also ongoing administrative costs and psychological burdens. Reflect on how simplicity can lead to more effective financial management in uncertain environments, particularly in volatile sectors like cryptocurrency.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for indicators such as monthly income levels, operational costs, and tax implications to determine if a shift to a more complex structure is warranted. Recognize that many individuals may falsely project success based on external factors (e.g., social media portrayals) rather than actual financial health. Patterns of financial stress often emerge among those who adopt complex structures without sufficient revenue to justify them.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Apply a phased approach to business structure decisions: 
   1. Start as an individual trader to minimize costs and simplify taxation.
   2. Monitor income and operational efficiency closely.
   3. Transition to a more complex structure (e.g., SAS) only when consistent revenue surpasses a critical threshold, ensuring that the move is financially justified.
   4. Regularly reassess business structure in response to changing financial conditions and regulatory environments.

**Important Notes:**
- Emphasize a mindset of simplicity and flexibility in financial strategies, particularly in the rapidly changing crypto landscape.
- Focus on actionable insights that prioritize financial health and operational efficiency over perceived legitimacy or status. 
- Use this methodology to guide decisions in both personal finance and entrepreneurial ventures, adapting to evolving market dynamics.

Chapter Two - Carnegie Club, Manhattan – 11:58 p.m., December 2025
> 
You push through the heavy mahogany door and the city dissolves behind you as completely as a bad memory, replaced in a single heartbeat by a cocoon of warm cedar, slow-burning Cuban leaf, and low amber light that feels older than Manhattan itself, while the jazz trio breathes so softly in the corner that every brushed cymbal seems to hang in the air like incense and the upright bass walks a line so lazy you could balance a twenty-three-year-old Pappy Van Winkle on it without spilling a drop.

At the far corner table, three silhouettes lean in over heavy crystal tumblers and Cohibas that glow like tiny red suns, their French vowels floating above the hush, lighter and looser than any conversation you ever overheard on the terrace of the Café de Flore under a grey November sky.

Alex sets his phone down on the marble with the quiet, deliberate authority of a man who has finally stopped needing to prove anything to anyone, and the Fairmint dashboard unfurls across the dark surface like liquid emerald: a live cap table that updates itself in real time, a treasury balance pulsing gently in USDC, and a countdown that feels less like a clock and more like the heartbeat of something alive, hungry, and gloriously indifferent to European bureaucracy.

3 days, 8 hours, 35 minutes…

He lets the numbers bleed for a long, deliberate moment, long enough for the ice in his glass to crack once with the soft violence of a starting gun only he can hear, before he finally speaks.

“Last winter in Paris,” he begins, voice low enough that the smoke curling toward the vaulted ceiling almost drowns him out, “we had a liturgy that would have made medieval monks jealous, a Sunday-night ritual where we opened the same Google Sheet—‘SAS Break-Even 2025 – Final Final v17’—and stared at the sacred cell that read €25,000 gross per month as though it were the Holy Grail itself, because if the options desk ever delivered that number consistently, month after month without fail, the 15 % IS would finally beat the 30 % flat tax, the accountant would stop drinking our blood one €1,200 invoice at a time, the cotisation subsidiaire would finally die a quiet death, and we would be free at last. We treated twenty-five thousand euros the way pilgrims once treated Jerusalem: distant, luminous, and almost certainly unattainable.”

Léo exhales a ribbon of smoke that catches the amber light like a ghost of Parisian rain and laughs with the faint scar tissue of someone who once believed the system could be gamed, then continues, rolling the memory around his mouth like a bad vintage he is finally ready to spit out.

“Tools?” he asks, drawing the word out until it sounds obscene. “Dext for receipts, Pennylane for the compta, Shine for the bank that still asked for paper proofs in 2025, Notion for the tears, and an accountant who charged €1,200 just to open the Hyperliquid export and sigh dramatically.
> 
Monthly burn before we had eaten a single euro of our own yield: €2,100, every month, like clockwork, like penance. Every January the avis d’imposition arrived like a funeral invitation written in bureaucratic calligraphy and sealed with the cold kiss of the Direction Générale des Finances Publiques.

”Romain, the quiet one who actually writes the options that make the money while the rest of us sleep, leans forward, the ember of his Cohiba flaring like a tiny red star against the dark, taps the phone once, and the dashboard expands into something that feels almost indecent in its elegance: clean lines, real-time dilution math, programmable vesting cliffs that lock and unlock themselves, treasury guardrails written in immutable code, and a weekly dividend contract that looks less like software and more like poetry written in pure, unemotional money. “Compare that to tonight,” he murmurs, the words rolling out slow and deliberate, savoring every syllable the way you savor the last pull of a cigar you know you will never smoke in Paris again.

“Delaware Series LLC formed in forty-eight hours for less than the price of a Paris parking ticket, Fairmint onboarded us the following Monday, minted ERC-1400 security tokens by Tuesday, and by Wednesday morning an angel bought five percent while his G650 taxied at Teterboro, all from his phone, no notary, no greffe, no existential crisis. The entire cap table lives on-chain, updated in real time, prettier than any Notion board we ever built in the 7th arrondissement.
Treasury guardrail at ninety days runway, automated 1099s, secondary market toggle locked until we decide the world is ready. 

Monthly software burn? Mercury banking: zero. Less than one Parisian accountant’s espresso and croissant on a slow Tuesday.

”He pauses, letting the silence do the real violence, letting the numbers hang in the smoke like a verdict. Alex picks up the thread again, slower now, almost tender, the way you speak about an ex you no longer hate but will never call again. “Last week the desk closed twenty-eight thousand gross after fees, and in Paris that would have been a week of panic-exporting CSVs, begging the comptable to look at them before Christmas, discovering another surprise charge no one can explain, and finally distributing what was left while the CSM laughed in our face like a well-dressed sadist. Here the money landed Monday, the dividend contract woke up Friday at 17:03, and every single holder—us, the angel on the yacht in Miami, the seed guy who ghosted us in July—woke up to fresh USDC and a soft ping that said, simply, gm. Fairmint had already stamped the tax forms. We were still asleep.

”The countdown hits 3d 8h 34m 00s exactly.

Alex kills the screen.

The room feels darker, heavier, as if the city itself has leaned in to listen.

“In Paris, twenty-five thousand euros a month was Jerusalem. Here, twenty-five thousand is the moment the dividend contract yawns, tops up the treasury with another BTC, and quietly asks, in perfect, unemotional Solidity, when we plan to add the next comma.” He lifts the heavy crystal. Ice cracks like a starter pistol.

## Conclusion

“To Fridays that pay themselves, and to software that costs less than one Parisian accountant’s sigh.” Three glasses rise above the ashtray and meet in a single, perfect note that disappears instantly into cedar, smoke, and the low, relentless pulse of a city that never asks you to prove you belong—only to grow fast enough to stay. Outside, the December wind still howls down 56th Street, carrying faint memories of grey afternoons and avis d’imposition. Inside, the countdown keeps falling, the tokens keep accruing, and three former pilgrims of the 25k Rule have already forgotten what a French winter even felt like.

The old continent is still waiting for its miracle.
Manhattan has already moved on to the next zero.
