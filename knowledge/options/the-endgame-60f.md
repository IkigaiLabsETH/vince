Honestly, I think we’re all feeling it now—the era of that ridiculously easy money in crypto is done. You know, those days when you could park your capital somewhere and pull 20-30%+ yields with basically no real risk? Yeah, those are gone. Think back: Farming the Kimchi premium back in the day (2016-2018). Chasing airdrops like it was free candy (that ran hot through 2024, but honestly, it’s cooled off a lot this year). All those restaking predeposits and TVL-chasing deals in 2023-2024. The basis trade—man, that was a beast from 2017, carried us through most of 2025, but even that’s unwound hard now with spreads compressing. Points farming on fixed-rate stuff like Pendle last year. And perp DEX yields... those were insane in 2022, but they’re pretty much chopped up and fading as we speak.

I could go on forever about each one—the sheer size of those opportunities, how patient plays without leverage printed serious returns for so many of us.

## Context

But those days? They’re over. The market’s matured, arbitrage got eaten up, and now we’re in a world where yield doesn’t come that cheap anymore.

And that’s exactly why options are stepping up as the real endgame for generating scaled, thoughtful yield. You get to choose your risk precisely, get paid for it transparently, and use any collateral you already hold. No more chasing ghosts—it’s sustainable because it’s just transferring real volatility someone else doesn’t want. Let me show you why this feels different...

Look, selling options has been the quiet powerhouse for generating serious yield in traditional finance forever. And honestly, it’s not some flashy hack. The risks are right there in front of you, no hidden surprises. And pretty much any asset can be turned into yield this way. Let me walk you through 2 ways to do this.

First up: The Covered Call\*\*

This is the classic move that big institutions love. You’ve got a pile of assets just sitting in your account, maybe earning a pathetic 5-10 basis points from lending them out. Boring, right? But if you’ve got a view on price—say, you’re cool selling your Bitcoin if it hits a certain level—you can sell a call option at that strike.

You’re basically getting paid upfront for a limit sell order you were happy to place anyway. The cool part? This isn’t some temporary exploit that vanishes when everyone jumps in. It’s a straight risk transfer. You’re taking on the volatility that someone else desperately wants off their books.
\*\*
Picture this: Bitcoin’s at $86k, and you’re fine letting it go at $100k. Sell a one-month $100k call, and you pocket around $1,250 in premium. That’s roughly 17% annualized if you’re fully collateralized. Not bad for committing to something you’d do for free otherwise.

Second: Selling Puts\*\*

If you’re feeling more bullish—or just think the downside is overblown—you flip to selling puts. This pays you to take on downside risk at a price you’re comfortable buying at. Say you doubt Bitcoin drops below $70k by late January. Sell that $70k put, collect $970 premium (that’s $11,640 annualized), and you’re on the hook to buy at $70k if it happens. In options land, you get paid to take risks that perps bury in funding rates and liquidations.
\*\*
Remember when everyone was chasing those 20% delta-neutral yields in perps? That felt like free money until it wasn’t, and it’s gone for good now. Suddenly, getting paid real USD premiums (like 20% terms) to set a limit sell at $100k looks pretty damn appealing. And here’s the magic: they make the whole market better for everyone. Options get cheaper as more sellers pile in. Liquidity tightens up as market makers jump in to trade against them. It’s this flywheel that turns options into something retail can actually use properly.

With crypto yield permanently reshaped, options are ready to take center stage. Volumes are about to start that 60x ramp to catch up with tradfi’s options dominance over futures. And I bet it happens faster than people think.

RFQ on Derive: \*\*

One of the best parts about trading on Derive. RFQ stands for Request for Quote. Think of it like this: instead of just hitting the regular order book (where liquidity might be thin for something complex or chunky), you basically ping the professional market makers directly and say, “Hey, I want to do this trade—give me your best price.” On Derive, it’s built right into the platform. You describe what you want—could be a simple option, a multi-leg spread, or even a bigger block size—and the system sends it out to participating market makers. They shoot back firm, executable quotes super fast.

## Conclusion

Why’s this killer for big sizes? The normal order book is great for smaller trades, but if you’re moving serious notional, slamming the book can cause slippage—prices move against you, partial fills, all that headache. With RFQ, you get tailored quotes for the exact size you need, often at tighter spreads, without tipping your hand to the whole market or getting front-run.

And the magic for spreads? Derive’s RFQ system is smart—it auto-detects when you’re building something like a call spread and treats it as one atomic trade. You execute the whole thing in one click, no leg risk, better pricing, lower fees (sometimes just charged on one leg). It’s fully onchain and self-custodial, but feels pro-grade. Perfect for when you’re scaling up those volatility-selling strategies without the drama. If you’re poking around the app, look for the RFQ view—it’s right there for those bigger or trickier moves. Makes life way easier.

> With over $16B in total trading volume and $120M in TVL, Derive empowers users with automated, programmable strategies to build, grow, and preserve wealth. Co-founded by Nick Forster, Jake Fitzgerald, Mike Spain, and Dom Romanowski, Derive is redefining the standard for onchain Options.
