Berachain has some of the best tech stack in the cycle and a war chest that most teams would kill for. Yet it is still wired to die the same death as every other “neutral” chain: Proof-of-Liquidity is just expensive advertising that rents apps instead of owning demand. 

Unless BERA becomes mathematically mandatory for the single most desirable activity on the chain, the token will decouple from reality and bleed out slowly, no matter how much TVL or how many viral apps it hosts. Hyperliquid just proved the old playbook is dead. There is no more time for half-measures.

## Context

The Solution**

Build and own the Bera Vault.
Everything else is noise.

The Bera Vault is not another DeFi primitive. 

## Main

It is the Hyperliquid of options yield—the first consumer product that finally makes selling cash-secured puts and covered calls as easy as staking, and it routes 100 % of the revenue back to the BERA token.

Here’s what it looks like when you actually use it.

You land on vault.berachain.com.
You deposit BERA (or BTC/ETH that the vault instantly wraps).
You receive sBERA – liquid, auto-compounding, yield-bearing.

Then you choose one button:

- 
“Sell weekly puts on BTC/ETH and earn 20–50 % APR”

- 
“Sell weekly calls on BTC/ETH and earn 15–40 % APR”

That’s literally it. No Greeks. No manual rolls. No complexity. The vault pools risk, auto-hedges when needed, and pays you in cold, hard premium. If you ever get assigned, you either end up long the asset cheaper than spot or sell it higher than you ever imagined. You cannot lose unless BTC or ETH goes to zero.

Every single dollar of premium paid by buyers is split two ways:
70 % goes instantly to the individual seller.
30 % stays in the vault and is used to buy back BERA on open market and redistribute it as additional yield to all sBERA holders.

Liquidation penalties, imbalance fees, sequencer revenue, every scrap of value the vault generates, flows into the same buyback engine. The bigger the vault gets, the more BERA is permanently removed from circulation and the higher the real yield for holders becomes. It is a perfect, self-reinforcing flywheel.

Collateral is non-negotiable: only staked BERA qualifies as margin and only sBERA unlocks the best rates. Want to sell options on the deepest, most liquid venue in crypto? You buy and lock BERA. There is no other way.

Proof-of-Liquidity v3 is redesigned as a precision weapon. Ninety percent of all future emissions go exclusively to sBERA–BTC, sBERA–ETH, and sBERA–HONEY pairs. The last ten percent is reserved for strategic partners who contractually route at least half their premiums back into the vault’s buyback engine. Everyone else gets zero. No blanket subsidies, no ecosystem theater, no more renting mercenaries.

This is the same “own your app, eat the revenue” strategy that turned Hyperliquid from nothing into a top-ten asset in eighteen months, except the underlying primitive is superior. Perpetual futures are a momentum product that thrives in manias and starves in chop. Options yield (especially covered calls and cash-secured puts) is the largest retail yield strategy on planet Earth and prints hardest when volatility is moderate and capital just wants to sit and earn.

The Bera Vault will make money in every market environment except an apocalypse. The timing could not be more perfect. The next two years will be defined by tens of millions of new BTC and ETH holders who finally want safe, capital-efficient income on assets they never plan to sell. 

The Bera Vault becomes their default home, and BERA becomes the only rational collateral to use it. Announce the vault. Ship it within ninety days of launch. Hit one billion locked and one hundred thousand weekly sellers.

Do this and BERA joins the tiny club of tokens with genuine, structural, perpetual demand, alongside ETH, SOL, and HYPE. Fail to do this and Berachain becomes the best-engineered zombie chain in history.

## Conclusion

There is no third path.
Hyperliquid removed all doubt.
Own the app, own the revenue, own the future.

Build the Bera Vault.
Everything else is already dead.
