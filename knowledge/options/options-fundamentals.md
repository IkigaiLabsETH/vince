# Options Fundamentals for Crypto Trading

## Core Concepts

### Option Types
- **Call Option**: Right to BUY the underlying asset at the strike price
- **Put Option**: Right to SELL the underlying asset at the strike price

### Key Terms
- **Strike Price**: The price at which you can exercise the option
- **Premium**: The cost to buy the option
- **Expiration**: When the option contract ends
- **ITM (In-The-Money)**: Option has intrinsic value (call: spot > strike, put: spot < strike)
- **OTM (Out-of-The-Money)**: Option has no intrinsic value
- **ATM (At-The-Money)**: Strike price ≈ current spot price

## The Greeks

### Delta (Δ)
- **Measures**: How much option price changes per $1 move in underlying
- **Range**: 0 to 1 for calls, -1 to 0 for puts
- **Interpretation**: 
  - Delta 0.50 = Option moves $0.50 for every $1 underlying move
  - Also approximates probability of expiring ITM

### Gamma (Γ)
- **Measures**: Rate of change of delta
- **Highest**: At ATM options near expiration
- **Risk**: High gamma = rapid delta changes = harder to hedge

### Theta (Θ)
- **Measures**: Time decay (how much value lost per day)
- **Always Negative**: For long options (you lose value over time)
- **Accelerates**: As expiration approaches

### Vega (V)
- **Measures**: Sensitivity to implied volatility changes
- **Higher**: For longer-dated options and ATM strikes
- **Strategy**: Long vega = profit from volatility increase

### Rho (ρ)
- **Measures**: Sensitivity to interest rate changes
- **Less Relevant**: For short-dated crypto options

## Implied Volatility (IV)

### Understanding IV
- **Definition**: Market's expectation of future volatility
- **Not Historical**: IV is forward-looking, not backward
- **Premium Driver**: Higher IV = higher option premiums

### IV Surface
- **Volatility Smile**: OTM puts and calls often have higher IV than ATM
- **Term Structure**: Longer-dated options may have different IV than near-term
- **Skew**: Difference between put IV and call IV (indicates market bias)

### Reading IV Signals
- **High IV**: Market expects big move, options expensive
- **Low IV**: Market complacent, options cheap
- **IV Crush**: Post-event IV collapse (after announcements, etc.)

## Common Strategies

### Income Generation
1. **Covered Call**: Own asset + sell OTM call
   - Profit: Premium + any gain up to strike
   - Risk: Miss upside above strike, still have downside exposure

2. **Cash-Secured Put**: Have cash + sell OTM put
   - Profit: Premium if price stays above strike
   - Risk: Forced to buy at strike if price drops

### Directional Plays
1. **Long Call**: Bullish, unlimited upside, limited loss (premium)
2. **Long Put**: Bearish, profit from price drop, limited loss (premium)
3. **Call Spread**: Buy call + sell higher call (capped profit, lower cost)
4. **Put Spread**: Buy put + sell lower put (capped profit, lower cost)

### Volatility Plays
1. **Straddle**: Buy ATM call + ATM put (profit from big move either direction)
2. **Strangle**: Buy OTM call + OTM put (cheaper than straddle, needs bigger move)
3. **Iron Condor**: Sell OTM call spread + put spread (profit from low volatility)

## Crypto-Specific Considerations

### Funding Rates vs Options
- **Perp Funding**: Ongoing cost/income, variable
- **Options Premium**: One-time cost, fixed
- **Trade-off**: Negative funding can make puts more attractive than shorts

### 7-Day Options (Weeklies)
- **Popular in Crypto**: Deribit standard expiration cycle
- **Higher Theta**: Faster time decay than monthlies
- **Gamma Risk**: Significant near expiration
- **Strategy Fit**: Income generation (covered calls), short-term directional

### Liquidity Considerations
- **BTC**: Most liquid options, tightest spreads
- **ETH**: Second most liquid, reasonable spreads
- **SOL/Others**: Less liquidity, wider spreads, careful with size

### Key OI Levels
- **Magnetic Effect**: Large OI at strikes can act as support/resistance
- **Max Pain**: Strike where most options expire worthless
- **Whale Watching**: Track large OI changes for positioning signals

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- **Never Risk More Than**: 2-5% of portfolio per trade
- **Premium Paid**: Your maximum loss on long options
- **Margin Requirements**: Understand collateral for short options

### Greeks Management
- **Delta Neutral**: Balance long/short deltas to reduce directional risk
- **Gamma Scalping**: Profit from underlying moves while maintaining delta neutral
- **Theta Harvesting**: Time decay collection through short options

### Exit Strategies
- **Profit Targets**: Define exit points before entry
- **Stop Losses**: For long options, often % of premium paid
- **Rolling**: Extend expiration by closing and opening new position
- **Adjustment**: Modify strikes/size as market moves

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources
- **Deribit**: Main crypto options exchange (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- **Coinglass**: Derivatives data aggregator
- **Skew**: Professional-grade options analytics

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Open Interest**: Total outstanding contracts
- **Volume**: Daily trading activity
- **Put/Call Ratio**: Market sentiment indicator
- **IV Rank/Percentile**: Is IV high or low historically?
- **Max Pain**: Where do market makers want price at expiration?

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Options Types**: Understanding the distinction between call and put options, including their respective rights and implications.
- **The Greeks**: Utilizing Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho to assess risk and manage positions effectively.
- **Implied Volatility (IV)**: Recognizing IV as a key driver of option pricing and understanding its implications for market expectations.
- **Common Strategies**: Developing a repertoire of strategies such as covered calls, straddles, and iron condors to address specific market conditions.
- **Crypto-Specific Considerations**: Adapting traditional options strategies to the unique dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, including liquidity and funding rates.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Approach options trading through a structured analysis of the Greeks to gauge potential price movements and risks. Assess market sentiment using implied volatility to guide entry and exit decisions. Evaluate options strategies based on current market conditions, such as liquidity and the time horizon of trades.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor volatility patterns, such as the volatility smile and skew, to identify bullish or bearish market sentiment. Pay attention to significant open interest (OI) levels and the concept of max pain, as these can indicate potential support and resistance levels. Look for signs of IV crush around major announcements or events as signals for potential trading opportunities.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Implement a strategy that aligns with market conditions and personal risk tolerance. For income generation, consider using covered calls or cash-secured puts in stable markets. For directional plays, utilize long calls or puts based on market forecasts. In volatile markets, adopt straddles or strangles to capitalize on expected price movements. Always assess the liquidity of the options being traded to minimize slippage and improve execution.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on the systematic approach to options trading rather than on specific historical data. Emphasize the importance of adaptability in strategies based on current market conditions and continually refine your analytical framework to incorporate new insights and patterns observed in the crypto landscape.
