As 2025 draws to a close on December 18, Bitcoin traders face a familiar paradox—spot prices hugging the mid-$86,000–$87,000 range after the December 17 liquidity hunt wick, while gold trades near $4,330 and equities hold firm on AI momentum. The multi-month chop persists, pinned by the Deribit-dominated derivatives structure we’ve dissected all year: positive dealer gamma enforcing mean reversion, crushed implied volatility in the mid-40s%, and a relentless yield farm taxing upside.

Yet the massive December 26 quarterly expiry—Boxing Day, no less—looms as a potential inflection point. Thin holiday liquidity (expected to peak between December 20 and January 5) amplifies risks, with divisive narratives clashing amid heavy options positioning.

## Context

Deribit Forensics: Building Put Defense, Buying Upside into 2026**

Fresh flows reveal a nuanced shift:

- 
Dec 26 expiry: Significant put OI buildup, with the 85k strike now holding 15k contracts ($1.25B notional). ATM around 86k shows bears and FUD temporarily in control—downside protection dominates near-term. High 100k+ call positions (~$1.75B notional condors) feel like distant punts, unlikely to pay off pre-expiry.

## Main

- 
Rolls and longer-dated flows: Dec 85–70k puts are actively rolling into Jan 80–75k puts and put spreads—extending downside hedges rather than letting them expire worthless. Meanwhile, upside bias persists into Q1 2026: notable buys in Mar 105k–125k call spreads, Jan–Mar ~100–125k calendars, and Mar 110k calls (total ~$6.5M premium deployed).

**
Key question as expiry approaches: Will these Dec puts expire (signaling the hedge was tactical against anticipated year-end selling pressure, which has materialized in recent months) or get fully rolled/replaced (hinting at structural bearish conviction)? The rolls suggest the latter—protection is being maintained, not abandoned.

Debunking the OG Covered Call Narrative: ([Read Tug-Of-War](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/p/options-tug-of-war))**

**Call Spreads, Not Whales, Drive Skew**

A recent influential analysis proposed that long-dated (3–6 month+) soft upside call skew on Deribit stems from aggressive covered call selling by early Bitcoin holders (OGs), suppressing spot and explaining 2025’s lag.

Counter-evidence from Deribit flows is compelling:

- 
No material covered call selling in recent weeks—instead, consistent bullish call spread buying (e.g., 100–130% or 110–140% ratios) that naturally depresses higher strikes without requiring spot dumps.

- 
Longer-dated OI (Jun/Sep) in high strikes is thin (~13k calls, ~3,250 BTC equivalent delta)—insufficient to “pin” multi-billion-dollar spot markets.

- 
Historical context: A prominent summer 2025 covered call seller (likely institutional, not OG) dampened short-dated vol but faded after spot surged through their strikes to the October 126k ATH. Their absence since mid-October aligns with vol regime shifts, not persistent suppression.

Soft upside skew reflects hedge fund/institutional spread buying and low liquidity in far-dated tenors—not a flood of OG overwriting. Spot leads options in Bitcoin’s still-nascent derivatives market; structural pinning requires far larger gamma than current longer-dated flows provide.

**Holiday Liquidity + Massive Expiry = Opportunistic Chaos**
> 
The Dec 26 event combines quarterly rolls with thin books—classic setup for amplified wicks, hunts, and potential gamma shifts. Positive gamma remains dominant (dealers hedging to dampen swings), but rolled puts could inject negative gamma if downside accelerates. Recent ETF flows offer a counterforce: +$457M on December 17 (strongest day in weeks, led by Fidelity and BlackRock), pushing cumulative inflows past $57B—yet insufficient to overpower Deribit’s crypto-native structure without sustained upside call demand on regulated venues.

## Conclusion

Echoing prior trader feedback: In this positive GEX regime, vol-selling (strangles/condors around max pain) and nimble wick scalps reward patience. Watch for rolls post-expiry—if puts extend en masse while calls rebuild higher, the wall endures into 2026. A clean break (failed rolls + IV lift) could finally flip gamma negative, shattering the range.

For now, the old guard’s machine—and holiday thinning—hold sway. Gold and stocks close the year strong; Bitcoin grinds in the gauntlet, ironic testament to its holders’ yield ingenuity. Patience, forensics, and positioning rule. The cycle turns when the gamma—and liquidity—does. Into 2026, eyes on the flip.
