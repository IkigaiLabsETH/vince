At its core, the wheel involves a cyclical process: selling cash-secured puts on an asset you’re willing to own (like Bitcoin), collecting premiums as income, and if assigned, transitioning to selling covered calls on the acquired position to generate further premiums until the asset is called away. This then resets the wheel, allowing you to repeat the put-selling phase. It’s particularly potent in sideways or mildly trending markets, turning volatility into a reliable income stream without requiring pinpoint directional accuracy.

On platforms like Hypersurface or Deribit, the wheel shines due to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. As seen in the provided screenshot from Hypersurface, and a January 2, 2026, expiration (roughly 7 days out as of December 26, 2025), traders can secure attractive annualized percentage returns (APRs) on covered calls.

## Context

For instance, the $89,000 strike offers a 56% APR with a 33% sell probability, translating to a short-cycle premium of about $795 on 1 BTC.

It balances the odds of assignment (selling BTC and returning to stablecoins) against the upfront premium as pure income, all while maintaining the underlying BTC position to avoid missing potential upside. Since this represents only a tiny portion of the portfolio and you’re equally comfortable holding stablecoins or the 1 BTC, the focus shifts squarely to maximizing that weekly premium haul without overemphasizing long-term holding risks.

The goal here is to generate consistent income—targeting around $1,000 per week—from premiums while giving your BTC some room to breathe if it recovers, especially after getting assigned at $90,000 from last week’s puts.

## Main

We’ll use the platform’s APR and Sell Probability columns to guide us, plus a few quick external checks to confirm the market isn’t setting us up for a bad surprise. With the position being small and your flexibility on holding BTC or stables, we can lean into higher-yield strikes to hit that income target.

Since we’re happy to hold stables if assigned and this is a minor allocation, assignment isn’t a setback—it’s just flipping back to the put-selling phase with fresh capital for more premiums.

Our chosen $89,000 covered call makes sense in this context: It offers a high APR and a good shot (about 67%) at keeping the premium without selling.

If Bitcoin rebounds and closes above $89,000, we get assigned and sell at $89,000. But with stables as a comfortable alternative, this maximizes yield without drama. In this short 7-day window, it captures volatility efficiently, especially if the market stays choppy.

In the wheel strategy, we want calls that prioritize premium income, given our income-focused goal and indifference to holding BTC long-term here.

To back this up and make sure it’s not just a hunch, I always peek at a few external spots for market mood—think of them as weather radars before committing. First, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. It’s at 20 right now, indicating “Extreme Fear,” which means call premiums are puffed up from people betting on upside protection. That supports leaning into higher-yield strikes like $89,000, as extreme fear inflates premiums without needing to go too far OTM—perfect for hitting $1K/week on a small position.

Next, implied volatility (IV), the market’s vibe on future swings—short-term IV is elevated around 65%, compared to historical volatility (HV) at about 40%, creating a seller-favorable gap (IV/HV ratio over 1.5). This means options are pricey, boosting premiums for income plays without extreme risk of collapse in 7 days, especially in a market eyeing $90,000–$92,500 as key breakout levels.

> Lastly, perpetual funding rates on exchanges like Binance give a leverage crowd hint. The latest average is a positive 0.0103%, neutral-to-bullish territory—not too bearish to drag us down, but suggesting mild upside bias without immediate cascades. Sentiment on X is mixed, with some expecting a bullish push to $106,000–$108,000 on a breakout above $92,500, while others warn of downside to $78,000 if below $85,000.

## Conclusion

By picking strikes wisely—like leaning into $89,000 for max income—and glancing at stuff like the Fear & Greed Index, implied volatility, and funding rates, we’re dodging the major traps and lining ourself up to cash in on crypto’s volatility. Look, the wheel’s all about steady wins through premiums, not tying up big capital—it’s those consistent, no-drama cycles that stack up over time, especially when the position is small and the focus is pure yield.
