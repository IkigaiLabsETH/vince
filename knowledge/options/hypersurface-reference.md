# Hypersurface Options Reference

> **This is the ONLY platform we use for options trading.**
> All covered calls and secured puts are executed on Hypersurface.
> Deribit is used for IV/volatility data only, NOT for trading.

## Platform Overview

- **URL**: https://hypersurface.io
- **Assets**: HYPE, SOL, WBTC, ETH
- **Expiry**: Friday 08:00 UTC (weekly)
- **Early Exercise**: Hypersurface may exercise ITM options up to 24 hours before expiry
- **Settlement**: Automatic on expiry

## Settlement Timing (CRITICAL)

Options expire **Friday 08:00 UTC**:
- For Europe: Friday 09:00 CET / 10:00 CEST
- For US East: Friday 03:00 EST / 04:00 EDT
- For US West: Friday 00:00 PST / 01:00 PDT

IMPORTANT: for us that's 09:00 each friday

**Important**: Hypersurface may exercise ITM options up to ~24 hours before expiry when optimal for the protocol. This means Thursday evening decisions matter.

## Covered Calls

A covered call is selling someone the right to buy your asset at a chosen strike price.

**How it works:**
1. You own a crypto asset (HYPE, SOL, WBTC, ETH)
2. You sell a call option at a strike price
3. You earn an upfront premium (yield) regardless of outcome

**Outcomes at expiry:**

| Scenario | Price at Expiry | What Happens | What You Earn |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Below Strike | $95 (strike $100) | Keep asset + premium | Premium |
| At Strike | $100 (strike $100) | Keep asset + premium | Premium |
| Above Strike | $110 (strike $100) | Asset sold at $100 | Premium + $100 per unit |

**Key insight**: You keep the premium no matter what. If assigned, you sell at a price you chose as acceptable.

## Cash-Secured Puts

A cash-secured put is selling someone the right to sell you an asset at a chosen strike price.

**How it works:**
1. You hold stablecoins equal to (strike × quantity)
2. You sell a put option at a strike price
3. You earn an upfront premium (yield) regardless of outcome

**Outcomes at expiry:**

| Scenario | Price at Expiry | What Happens | What You Earn |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Above Strike | $110 (strike $100) | Keep cash + premium | Premium |
| At Strike | $100 (strike $100) | Keep cash + premium | Premium |
| Below Strike | $95 (strike $100) | Buy asset at $100 | Premium (reduces cost basis) |

**Key insight**: Premium reduces your effective purchase price. If assigned at $100 with $5 premium, your real cost basis is $95.

## Early Position Closures

You can close positions **BEFORE expiry** from the Portfolio Page.

**Steps:**
1. Go to Portfolio
2. Select your position
3. Click "Close Early"
4. Choose the portion to buy back
5. Pay the applicable premium

**After closing:**
- Position is settled, collateral is unlocked
- **CRITICAL: You must WITHDRAW collateral after closing — it doesn't auto-return to your wallet**

**Solus context — when to close early:**
- Position is deeply ITM and you'd rather take the loss now than risk full assignment
- Market regime changed (black swan, major news) and your thesis is invalidated
- You want to **roll**: close current position early, open new one at different strike/expiry
- Premium has decayed enough that buying back is cheap (time decay worked in your favor)

**Rolling strategy:**
Close early on Wednesday/Thursday when theta has eaten most of the premium → reopen Friday at new strike. This is how you adjust without waiting for expiry.

**Cost consideration:**
Early close premium = current market value of the option. If the option moved against you, closing early costs more than the premium you received.

```
Net P&L = Premium received − Close cost
```

If you sold a call for $50 premium and it's now worth $120 to close → you lose $70 net. Know this before clicking.

## Points Program

- **Season 1** is currently active
- Earn points by trading, community engagement, and protocol interaction
- Exact formula (weightings, thresholds, multipliers) is internal and may change
- **Distribution**: calculated weekly, distributed every **Wednesday**
- **Anti-abuse**: accounts showing abuse may be excluded at Hypersurface's full discretion
- Points have **NO inherent monetary value** currently
- **No guarantee** of future token rewards or airdrops
- **NFT multiplier**: must hold both Pass NFT AND partner NFT at the time of each weekly distribution. If either is sold/transferred before distribution, multiplier is not applied

**Solus context:**
Points are a bonus, not the strategy. Don't chase points by overtrading or taking bad strikes. The premium income is the real yield. Points are upside optionality on a potential airdrop — treat them like a free call option on the protocol.

## Eligibility

- US individuals are **NOT eligible** to use Hypersurface
- Everyone else: individuals and institutions welcome
- Only need: wallet + assets + determination

## The Wheel Strategy

The wheel is a systematic income strategy that cycles between covered calls and secured puts:

### Advanced Wheel Mechanics

**The Asymmetry Edge:**
- IV consistently overshoots realized volatility in crypto (the "volatility risk premium")
- This is the fundamental edge: you're selling insurance priced for catastrophe to a market that mostly doesn't catastrophe
- Every week you collect this spread. Over 52 weeks, the law of large numbers is your friend

**Position Sizing for the Wheel:**
- Never wheel with more than you'd be comfortable holding through a 50% drawdown
- For covered calls: the underlying IS your position. If HYPE drops 40%, you own that drawdown
- For secured puts: if assigned, you're buying at strike. Would you buy there anyway? If no, don't sell the put
- Rule of thumb: wheel with 60-70% of your intended position size, keep 30-40% in reserve for averaging

**The "Roll" Decision Tree:**
```
Position ITM mid-week?
├── Yes, and thesis still valid → Hold, let it expire, accept assignment
├── Yes, and thesis broken → Close early, eat the cost, preserve capital
├── Yes, but barely → Monitor. Thursday night is decision time
└── No → Let theta work. Premium decays in your favor
```

**Week-over-week compounding:**
- Premium received → immediately deployable as collateral for next week
- Over 52 weeks at 2-3% weekly yield, compound effect is massive
- Key: reinvest premiums, don't withdraw unless needed for living expenses

**When to use secured puts vs buy back:**
- **Bullish on asset**: Buy back immediately at market, restart calls
- **Bearish on asset**: Sell puts at lower strike, get paid to wait for cheaper entry
- **Neutral**: Sell puts at same strike, collect premium while waiting

## Strike Selection (Friday Decision)

Every Friday, you must decide:

**For Covered Calls:**
- Higher strike = lower premium, lower assignment probability
- Lower strike = higher premium, higher assignment probability
- Sweet spot: Strike with ~20-35% assignment probability and >50% APR

**For Secured Puts (after assignment):**
- Strike at/below where you'd happily buy back
- Consider: recent support levels, funding rates, sentiment

**Hypersurface shows:**
- Sell price (strike)
- APR (annualized premium return)
- Sell probability (assignment probability)

### Strike Selection Cheat Sheet

**Conservative (sleep well):**
- Covered call: 15-20% OTM, ~10-15% assignment probability
- Secured put: 15-20% OTM below current price
- Lower premium but very unlikely assignment
- Best when: high uncertainty, major events upcoming, you REALLY don't want to be assigned

**Standard (sweet spot):**
- Covered call: 8-15% OTM, ~20-35% assignment probability
- Secured put: 8-15% OTM below current price
- Good premium/risk balance
- Best when: normal weeks, clear trend, comfortable with assignment

**Aggressive (max yield):**
- Covered call: 3-8% OTM or even ATM, ~40-60% assignment probability
- Secured put: 3-8% OTM below current price
- High premium but very likely assignment
- Best when: strong conviction on direction, want to exit/enter position anyway, using options as limit orders with premium

### IV Regime Matters

| IV Level | What It Means | Strike Approach |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| <50% | Low vol, calm market | Go closer to ATM for decent premium |
| 50-80% | Normal crypto vol | Standard strikes (8-15% OTM) |
| 80-120% | Elevated fear/greed | Wider strikes, premium still rich |
| >120% | Extreme event | Maximum premium opportunity — go wide, sell the fear |

**The golden rule: when IV spikes, premiums get FAT. That's when you lean in and sell aggressively (wider strikes). When IV is crushed, either skip or go very close to ATM.**

## Key Differences from Deribit

| Feature | Hypersurface | Deribit |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Execute wheel trades | IV/volatility data |
| **Interface** | Simple, wheel-focused | Complex, full options |
| **Expiries** | Weekly (Friday 08:00 UTC) | Multiple per week |
| **Assets** | HYPE, SOL, WBTC, ETH | BTC, ETH only |
| **Display** | APR, assignment probability | Greeks, IV surface |
| **Use case** | TRADING | ANALYSIS ONLY |

## Why Perps Data Matters for Strikes

Hyperliquid perps data informs strike selection:

- **High positive funding**: Longs crowded → higher chance of pullback → lower strikes safer
- **High negative funding**: Shorts crowded → squeeze potential → higher strikes may get hit
- **Rising OI + price**: Strong trend → strikes may be tested
- **Falling OI + price**: Weak conviction → range likely → closer strikes = more premium

**Workflow:**
1. HyperliquidAnalyst reads funding, OI, positioning
2. DeribitAnalyst reads IV, skew for volatility context
3. Friday: Pick strike on Hypersurface informed by both

## Current Workflow

```
Monday-Thursday: Monitor prices, funding, news
Thursday night: Review positions (early exercise possible)
Friday morning: Strike selection decision
Friday 08:00 UTC: Options expire
Friday: New positions opened for next week
```
