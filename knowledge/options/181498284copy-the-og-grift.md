## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Covered Calls:** Understanding the mechanics and implications of selling options on owned assets to generate yield.
- **Market Dynamics:** The impact of concentrated ownership on price action, particularly in markets with limited liquidity.
- **Call Walls:** The phenomenon where excessive selling of out-of-the-money calls creates upward pressure on prices, hindering significant market movements.
- **Diverse Demand:** The contrast between asset ownership structures in Bitcoin, Gold, and equities, influencing market behaviors and reactions.

**Analytical Approach:**
- **Contextual Analysis:** Assess the broader market influences and ownership distributions that affect asset pricing. Recognize that not just the asset itself, but the trading strategies employed by large holders can significantly impact volatility and price direction.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Consider the motivations of large holders (e.g., avoiding a price crash) and how these affect market dynamics. Analyze how their actions may lead to emergent patterns that are not immediately visible through traditional metrics.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Identify Call Supply Dynamics:** Monitor open interest in out-of-the-money calls across different assets to detect potential "call walls." A disproportionate amount of call selling might indicate resistance levels for price movements.
- **Diversity of Ownership:** Evaluate the composition of ownership in various assets. A more diverse ownership structure typically correlates with less price manipulation and steadier upward trends.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Risk Management:** Incorporate the understanding of options dynamics in trading strategies. Consider hedging positions when significant call selling is detected to mitigate risks from market stagnation or pullbacks.
- **Market Entry and Exit Points:** Use the analysis of call walls and diverse demand to identify optimal entry and exit points. Recognize that periods of low volatility may provide opportunities for strategic buying ahead of potential breakouts triggered by shifts in market sentiment or external events.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on underlying methodologies rather than specific metrics or time frames.
- Extract insights on how to approach current market situations using the frameworks discussed.
- Ensure that the analysis remains actionable and relevant to ongoing market developments.

TL;DR: Bitcoin is stuck in a frustrating sideways range around $90k because early whales and big holders are aggressively selling covered calls on Deribit (massive open interest in out-of-the-money calls, thin puts), creating a “call wall” that dealers hedge by selling rallies and buying dips, crushing volatility and capping upside while they farm premiums. This dynamic is unique to BTC due to its concentrated ownership by OGs who won’t sell spot outright. Gold, up over 55-60% in 2025 (now ~$4,300/oz), benefits from diverse demand (central banks, ETFs, safe-haven buyers) without the same one-sided call overhang. Magnificent 7 stocks have ripped higher on fundamentals, deep liquidity, and balanced options markets that absorb any covered call selling. Latest Deribit Dec 2025 expiry board shows the same lopsided call-heavy setup, confirming the thesis is still in play and keeping BTC lagging while everything else moons. Frustrating, but could break with ETF options dominance or a big macro shock.

Let’s break it down properly, just shooting the shit over coffee.**

## Context

Here’s the deal with covered calls: you own the asset, you sell someone the option to buy it off you at a set price higher than today, and you pocket the premium upfront. If the price never gets there, the option expires worthless, and you keep the cash. Feels like easy yield, right? Individually, sure. But when a ton of big holders all do it at scale, it starts warping the market.

In Bitcoin, that’s exactly what’s happening. A lot of the early whales—guys who stacked coins cheap years ago—aren’t selling their spot outright because that would crash the price and nuke their own bags. Instead, they’re flooding platforms like Deribit with calls, especially those just out-of-the-money. 
**
Dealers who buy those calls hedge by selling into any rally (to stay delta-neutral) and buying on dips. Result? Price gets stuck in this brutal sideways chop. All that call selling adds supply overhead, crushes volatility, and kills big upside moves. Net effect: quietly bearish, because there’s no real fresh buying pressure to offset it.

Now, why doesn’t this hit gold the same way? Gold’s options market (mostly through COMEX futures) has covered calls too, miners hedge production, some funds generate income, but it’s not dominated by a concentrated group of “OG holders” dumping massive call supply. Gold ownership is super diverse: central banks hoarding for reserves, jewelry demand, huge ETF inflows (GLD alone pulled in billions this year on inflation fears). The buyers are real—hedgers, safe-haven chasers, and they balance out the sellers. No overwhelming “call wall” pinning the tops. That’s why gold’s up over 55% in 2025 while BTC grinds sideways: actual demand drives spot higher, without derivatives constantly taxing the upside.

## Main

And the Magnificent 7? Forget it. Their options markets are oceans—deep, liquid, ancient. Yeah, retirees and income ETFs sell covered calls on Apple or Nvidia shares for extra yield, but that’s a drop in the bucket. Ownership is spread across pensions, index funds, sovereign wealth, retail traders, nobody controls enough to flood the chain one-sidedly. Plus, there’s massive genuine call buying: people betting on AI growth, earnings beats, buybacks. Any covered-call supply gets swallowed whole. The stocks rip on fundamentals and hype; derivatives don’t pin them.

I’ve lived this pain personally, you know? Back in 2018, grinding as a crypto journo through the ICO crash, I tried a small covered call on some ETH I was holding. Collected a nice premium, felt smart… then the market tripled, and I watched most of the gains go to whoever bought my call. Sat there kicking myself. Same trap a lot of BTC holders fall into now, yeah it looks clever short-term, but collectively it’s capping our moons.

Fast-forward to today: that Deribit screenshot you sent for the 25 Sep 2026 expiry? Spot around $90k, underlying $93.8k, and look at that insane call open interest stacked from $100k to $170k. Puts? Barely anything down in the 40-60k strikes. IV crushed into the mid-40s. Textbook.

It’s the same story, nine months later. Whales still overwriting their stacks, farming premiums, keeping price glued in this $85-100k range. Dealers hedge, rallies fade fast, dips get bought mechanically. No real downside fear (thin puts), but upside’s rented out to oblivion. Exhausting to watch BTC lag everything else—AI stocks partying on rate cuts, gold shining on debasement—while we’re stuck in this yield-farming loop.

Could it change? Sure—if spot options on ETFs like IBIT fully overtake Deribit, or some macro shock overwhelms the gamma, or the OGs finally run out of coins to overwrite. But right now, this board screams the thesis is alive: concentrated call selling is still quietly taxing Bitcoin’s potential.

Kind of frustrating, isn’t it? **

The asset that’s supposed to be digital gold, uncorrelated freedom money, ends up range-bound because of its own holders’ income strategy.

Next time you pull up an options board—Deribit, CME gold futures, or a Mag7 chain—compare the skew. See if the call supply looks as lopsided.

Just got your latest screenshot pinged over—Deribit board for the 26 Dec 2025 quarterly expiry, underlying future sitting at about $90,582, spot probably hovering right around there (seeing ~$90.3k-$90.4k live today). IV across the board in the low 40s, around 41%. Damn, yeah... this absolutely validates the thesis. Hell, it might be the cleanest example we’ve seen yet.

Look at that open interest distribution—it’s textbook one-sided call wall.**

On the call side: massive OI stacked from basically ATM ($90k-$92k) all the way up through $100k, $105k, $108k, and beyond (thousands of contracts deep, peaking in those just-OTM to far-OTM strikes like $100k+). Delta climbing to near 1.0 on the deep ITM lower strikes, but the real meat is that heavy overhang starting 10-15% above spot and stretching out.

Puts? Thin. Scattered low OI down in the $60k-$80k range, deltas near zero, almost no real volume or interest below $85k or so. Hardly any protection being bought on the downside.

This is exactly the signature of concentrated covered call selling by the big holders—the OGs overwriting their stacks month after month, quarter after quarter. They’re not scared of downside (complacent put side), but they’re happily renting out all the upside, collecting those fat premiums while IV stays crushed in the 40s (still historically low for BTC, even in this “mature” phase).

Dealers hedge the short calls by selling into strength and buying weakness → price gets magnetically pinned right around this $90k level, rallies fade quick, dips get absorbed. No explosive moves either way. Spot’s been teasing $90k for what feels like forever now, while gold keeps grinding higher and the Mag7 shrug off everything.

And this is the big quarterly expiry—December 26, 2025—with 12 days left? If spot grinds sideways into it (which it probably will, given the gamma setup), most of those calls expire worthless, sellers pocket another round of yield, roll it forward to March or whatever. The machine just keeps churning.

It’s almost more extreme than the September 2026 board we looked at before. That one had calls out to $170k; this one’s tighter, more concentrated right overhead, which makes the pinning even stronger in the near term.

Frustrating as hell, right? BTC still playing the reluctant asset, lagging the broader risk-on wave because its own holder base keeps taxing the upside through this Deribit yield farm. Meanwhile, no equivalent concentrated OG dynamic in gold or equities to cap them the same way.

Could something finally break it? Maybe if ETF spot options fully cannibalize Deribit volume, or we get a real macro catalyst that blows through the gamma. But this board right here? Pure confirmation—the covered call grift is alive, well, and still quietly bearish on BTC’s relative performance.

If you grab any updates as expiry approaches or the next board, fire it over. 

I’m glued to this stuff too.

## Conclusion

Coffee’s on me next time, we earned it after staring at these walls all year. If something clicks or I’m missing a big piece (hey, markets humble you fast), shoot it my way. Or just vent. I’m right there with you.

We’re all just trying to make sense of this ride. Next time vol ticks up even a little, screenshot the skew on both sides, compare to these notes. Drop it here, tell me if you see the flip coming or if we’re still taxed by the old guard. Or hell, admit we’re just jaded cycle veterans. Either way, I’m listening.
