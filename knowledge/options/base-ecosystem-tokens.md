# Base Ecosystem Tokens: Strategy & Positioning

## Overview

Base has quietly become the chain where real volume lives. Fees stay negligible, liquidity pools deepen by the week, and native projects now move markets on their own merits—no Solana hand-me-down narratives required.

Attention rotates fast: one week it's meme launches, the next it's perps volume, then AI agents compounding yields. When that rotation hits, mid-cap tokens don't just trend—they gap.

We're Bitcoin maxis at core, but we track majors (SOL, ETH, HYPE) and keep an open mind about Base tokens that could outperform BTC during altcoin cycles when BTC dominance drops.

## Our Base Token Watchlist

### $ZORA

**Profile:** Onchain protocol focused on creator tools, NFTs, media minting, and an "attention market" on Base.

**Key Metrics (mid-January 2026)**

- Price: ~$0.036–0.038 USD
- Market Cap: ~$165–171M
- FDV: ~$380M
- Circulating Supply: ~4.47B tokens (total: 10B)
- 24h Volume: $20–30M+ (high liquidity on Uniswap Base)
- Contract (Base): `0x1111111111166b7fe7bd91427724b487980afc69`

**Why We Watch:**

- Owns the onchain creator and meme engine on Base
- Strong integration with Base ecosystem; high onchain activity from creator drops
- Token surged 800%+ in mid-2025 tied to content tokenization features
- High volume relative to cap makes it suitable for volatility-based strategies
- Active X account driving attention (daily meme coin reports, "Zora TV" spaces)

**Positioning Context:**
Zora sits at the pressure point where creator culture meets trading volatility. When Base ecosystem attention rotates, Zora gaps. Enough depth for structured positions, yet small enough that ecosystem flows dictate price action.

### $AVNT

**Profile:** Synthetic assets and perpetuals platform on Base, offering up to 500x leverage on crypto and RWAs with zero trading fees.

**Key Metrics (mid-January 2026)**

- Price: ~$0.29–0.33 USD
- Market Cap: ~$75–82M
- Circulating Supply: ~258M tokens (total: 1B, fixed)
- 24h Volume: $20–46M (strong across venues)
- Contract (Base): `0x696F9436B67233384889472Cd7cD58A6fB5DF4f1`

**Why We Watch:**

- Runs the highest-leverage, cleanest synthetic markets on Base
- Backed by Pantera Capital and built natively on Base
- Active X presence: integrations (HeyElsa AI terminal, Base app), creator contests ("Leagues of Leverage"), new markets
- TVL growth and zero principal losses reported in 2025
- RWA focus adds new volatility sources beyond crypto
- Tied to active perps ecosystem—leverage trading amplifies moves

**Positioning Context:**
Avantis runs the derivatives engine on Base. When perps volume spikes or new markets launch, volatility compounds. Mid-cap with consistent volume suits options-style positioning, but option depth on Hypersurface is still thin.

### $MAMO

**Profile:** AI-powered personal finance agent on Base, focused on automated yield strategies via Moonwell, Aerodrome, and other protocols.

**Key Metrics (mid-January 2026)**

- Price: ~$0.024–0.025 USD
- Market Cap: ~$11–13M
- Circulating Supply: ~475–557M (varies)
- 24h Volume: $0.5–1M
- Contract (Base): `0x7300B37DfdfAb110d83290A29DfB31B1740219fE`

**Why We Watch:**

- Automates quiet yield with real revenue share (100% of fees go to depositors)
- Strong revenue growth (+414% weekly reported; $5K+ weekly drops in BTC/MAMO)
- Positioned in Base AI/agent narrative—compounding and low-stress yield farming
- Revenue tied to DeFi activity can spike with inflows
- Weekly revenue drops create consistent buying pressure

**Positioning Context:**
Mamo automates the yield engine on Base. When Base AI/agent narrative rotates in, Mamo benefits. However, smallest cap here—typical for faster moves but lowest underlying liquidity means getting filled at fair levels is challenging.

## Additional Hypersurface Tokens

### $AAVE

**Profile:** Aave is a decentralized lending protocol allowing users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies.

**Our Position:** ✅ **We like AAVE** - Established DeFi protocol with proven track record, solid fundamentals, and deep liquidity. Suitable for structured products positioning on Hypersurface.

**CoinGecko ID:** `aave`

---

### $ENA (Ethena)

**Profile:** Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, offering a crypto-native yield-generating stablecoin.

**Our Position:** ✅ **We like ENA** - Innovative protocol with strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Good liquidity for options positioning.

**CoinGecko ID:** `ethena`

---

### $KNTQ (Kinetiq)

**Profile:** Kinetiq is a token on the HyperEVM chain (EVM-compatible execution layer of Hyperliquid Layer 1).

**Our Position:** ✅ **We like KNTQ** - Native to the Hyperliquid ecosystem we're already engaged with. Aligned with our HYPE positions.

**CoinGecko ID:** `kinetiq`

---

### $PUMP (Pump.fun)

**Profile:** Pump.fun is a platform for launching meme coins and token projects.

**Our Position:** ⚠️ **Not big fans of PUMP** - Meme coin platform token with high volatility but questionable fundamentals. Lower priority for structured products due to unpredictable volatility patterns.

**CoinGecko ID:** `pump-fun`

---

### $XPL (Plasma)

**Profile:** Plasma is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for stablecoin operations (especially USDT), emphasizing zero fees for USDT transfers.

**Our Position:** ❌ **Avoid XPL** - Got burned back when we did LP for that token (max pain, down bad). Negative sentiment due to past losses. Not a priority for current positioning.

**CoinGecko ID:** `plasma`

**Historical Context:** Previous LP position resulted in significant losses. This experience informs our current avoidance of XPL despite its presence on Hypersurface.

## Our Strategy: Liquidity Thresholds Before Positioning

**Current Approach:** We run covered calls and cash-secured puts on BTC and SOL wrappers—deep liquidity, predictable volatility regimes, pools thick enough that exercise rarely hurts. Premiums compound quietly while we wait for targets.

**Base Token Evaluation Criteria:**

We're waiting for signals we already have on majors before rotating into Base tokens:

1. **Sustained Daily Volume:** North of $30-50M consistently
2. **Options Depth:** Consistent bid/ask depth on Hypersurface options themselves
3. **Market Maker Competition:** Multiple market makers competing on the options chain

**Current Status:**

- **$ZORA:** Spikes on meme rotations but volume dries up just as fast. Selling a call into a pump feels great until the bid disappears on assignment.
- **$AVNT:** Real perps flow, but option depth on Hypersurface is still thin. One decent seller can crush implied vol overnight.
- **$MAMO:** Premiums look juicy on paper, but low underlying liquidity means getting filled at fair levels is a coin flip. Forced exercise could leave you holding a bag with no exit.

**Our Position:**
We're not avoiding Base tokens out of principle. We're waiting for the liquidity confirmation. Until those signals show up, the edge is in collecting fat, reliable premiums on BTC and SOL while watching Base mid-caps mature.

**When the liquidity confirms, we'll rotate in—no hesitation.**

## Hypersurface Context

Hypersurface is an onchain structured products platform specializing in volatility yield (covered calls, cash-secured puts) on Base tokens and majors. It allows selling options on holdings like $ZORA, $AVNT, $MAMO, $AAVE, $ENA, $KNTQ (plus majors like BTC/ETH/SOL/HYPE), collecting premiums upfront while waiting for target prices.

**Token Prioritization on Hypersurface:**

- **High Priority:** BTC, ETH, SOL, HYPE (majors we actively trade)
- **Watchlist:** AAVE, ENA, KNTQ (tokens we like but evaluate on liquidity)
- **Monitor:** ZORA, AVNT, MAMO (Base tokens we're tracking for liquidity thresholds)
- **Low Priority:** PUMP (not big fans)
- **Avoid:** XPL (got burned on LP, max pain, down bad)

This fits environments where Base tokens exhibit volatility from ecosystem growth, memes, or trading activity—premiums can be rich during spikes, but risks include exercise (asset called away) or opportunity cost in strong rallies.

## Alignment with Core Strategy

1. **Bitcoin Maximalism:** We're Bitcoin maxis at core—BTC and major wrappers are our foundation.
2. **Major Tracking:** SOL, ETH, and HYPE are our primary focus for structured products.
3. **Open Mind on Alts:** Base tokens are watched for altcoin cycle opportunities when BTC dominance drops.
4. **Liquidity Discipline:** We won't position until liquidity metrics meet our thresholds.

This knowledge should inform token analysis: when evaluating Base tokens, consider not just current metrics but whether they meet our liquidity thresholds for structured products positioning.
