You own HYPE because you believe in the vision: the first truly scalable, fully on-chain options protocol. You also have some USDT0 sitting idle. This is the strategy that turns those two assets into the highest-conviction, lowest-stress yield play in DeFi — without ever adding leverage or liquidation risk.

**The Core Philosophy: Sell Fear, Not Hope**

## Context

The entire strategy rests on one immutable truth: Implied volatility almost always overshoots realized volatility, especially in crypto. When panic spikes, options premiums become absurdly rich relative to the actual odds of large moves. Our job is not to predict price — it’s to collect the difference between what the crowd is terrified might happen and what usually does.

That difference is pure edge.**We harvest it every week.

The Two-Leg Machine

## Main

- 
Covered Calls with your HYPE
You already own the token.
Every Monday you sell out-of-the-money calls against a portion of your bag.
You get paid upfront in HYPE.
Outcome A (most weeks): the call expires worthless → you keep the full premium and all your HYPE.
Outcome B: HYPE rips higher and you get assigned → you sell at a price you pre-agreed was attractive.
Either way you win.

- 
Cash-Secured Puts with your USDT0
Your stablecoins were earning nothing.
Now you sell out-of-the-money puts and lock the exact amount of USDT0 needed to buy HYPE at your chosen strike.
You get paid upfront in USDT0.
Outcome A (most weeks): put expires worthless → free yield on money that was idle.
Outcome B: HYPE drops and you get assigned → you buy the token you love at a meaningful discount.
Again, no losing scenario for a long-term believer.

Together these two legs form a “covered strangle” — the most antifragile position you can own when you’re already bullish on the underlying.

How We Choose Strikes (The Only Rule That Matters)**

We never chase the highest premium. We target roughly 20–30 delta on both sides (70–80% probability of expiring worthless on the Hypersurface slider).

Why this zone?

- 
Premium is still massive (captures ~80% of the richest strikes)

- 
Assignment risk stays low enough that theta decay does almost all the work

- 
When we do get assigned, the price is always one we were happy to transact at anyway

In extreme fear weeks → we widen the strikes and lean slightly put-heavy (downside fear is overpriced). In calm or bullish weeks → we tighten and go symmetric or slight call bias.

Same engine. Just two gears.

**The Weekly Ritual (60 Seconds of Work)**

Monday morning

- 
Open [hypersurface](https://app.hypersurface.io/)

- 
Covered Calls tab → slide to 70–80% OTM probability → sell

- 
Secured Puts tab → slide to 70–80% OTM probability → sell

- 
Close laptop

Repeat.

Why This Beats Every Other Yield Strategy in Crypto

- 
No leverage → no liquidation, ever

- 
Premium collected Day 1 → yours no matter what happens

- 
Assignment outcomes are intentionally attractive

- 
Works in every market regime: crashes pay the most, bull markets pay steadily

- 
Fully non-custodial, on-chain, audited, battle-tested

- 
You remain long the token you believe in, just smarter

Perps bleed you on funding and liquidate you on wicks.**Lending protocols get hacked or implode.
Staking locks you up and dilutes you.

This strategy just prints, quietly and consistently, week after week.

Final Thought**

If you own HYPE and you’re not running this weekly covered strangle, you are voluntarily leaving the highest risk-adjusted yield in DeFi on the table.

The market will keep panicking.**IV will keep overshooting.
Fear will keep getting mispriced.

We’ll keep farming it.

Not financial advice. Size responsibly. But if you’re long HYPE anyway, this is the closest thing crypto has to a free lunch.

P.S. – A Quick Word on the “Team Unstaking” FUD **

Next week a tiny slice of the Hyperliquid team’s vested $HYPE becomes unstaked (~2.6 million tokens, roughly 0.78% of total supply). Cue the usual circus: “team dumping,” “rug incoming,” recycled 2021 trauma memes, etc.

Let’s speak plainly. I’ve watched this team for two and a half years.
They have executed at a level most projects will never touch in ten lifetimes.

While nearly every other foundation in this industry was busy

- 
quietly diversifying treasury into USDC at the top,

- 
dumping on retail with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, or

- 
just ghosting entirely and letting the chart speak for itself…

Hyperliquid did the exact opposite. They voluntarily left close to a billion dollars of CEX-style cash revenue on the table and instead used it to buy back $HYPE — your bags — in the open market, repeatedly, at prices most teams would have used to cash out forever. They turned their treasury into a perpetual bid under the token they created.

That is not normal. That is the new industry gold standard, whether the timeline wants to admit it or not. So when a microscopic portion of their well-earned, fully vested allocation finally becomes liquid after years of lockup? I’m not going to clutch pearls or cry “sell the news.” If anyone on earth has earned the right to move a fraction of their stack without asking for permission or issuing a 47-tweet coping thread, it’s them. Even in the absolute worst-case fantasy where every token hits the open market on day one (it won’t), the current weekly options volume on Hypersurface alone is larger than the entire unlock. One Friday expiry absorbs it and moves on. Previous vesting events looked identical on the chart: 48 hours of weak-handed panic, exhausted sellers, then a violent rip higher as liquidity returned. Every. Single. Time.

We are doing exactly nothing different next week.
Same 20–30 delta strangle.
Same Monday deploy.
Same Friday collection.

Because the FUD around a predictable, tiny, fully deserved unstaking event is just more mispriced fear for us to sell. The team has more than earned the benefit of the doubt. They’ve paid for it — literally — with their own capital, over and over again.

## Conclusion

Stay calm.
Keep farming.
Let the timeline scream while we collect.

See you at the next expiry.
