I’m on my second glass of Côtes du Rhône. The studio’s dark except for the blue glow of my monitor, which is currently showing the Hyperliquid Assistance Fund wallet buying another quiet $2.4 million of HYPE and yeeting it into the void. Again. For the fourth time tonight. I should be asleep. Instead I’m muttering “what the actual fuck” to an empty room like a lunatic.

Look, I’ve been doing this crypto thing since you had to explain to your mom what Bitcoin was while she asked if it was like Beanie Babies. I watched Mt. Gox implode in real time. I held ETH through the DAO hack because “fundamentals.” Point is: I’m allergic to hopium. I shiver a little when someone says “paradigm shift.” And yet here I am, completely unable to look away from Hyperliquid.

> Because HIP-3 is the nastiest, most sociopathic piece of tokenomics anyone’s shipped in years, and the market is still pricing it like it’s just another perps casino with cute cat mascots.

## Context

Here’s the dirty little secret nobody wants to say out loud: HIP-3 is the worst staking product ever designed. Genuinely dogshit for anyone who stakes. Thirty-seven-day unbonding controlled by some random deployer who can slash you whenever he wakes up cranky? I wouldn’t lock my worst enemy’s capital in that. And that’s exactly why it’s genius for anyone who simply buys spot HYPE and goes to sleep.

Every new market that flips on is a scheduled supply nuke. Half a million tokens—fifteen million bucks at current prices—gets dragged off the market, handcuffed to a deployer’s ego, and told to sit in the corner for a month. Unit, Ventuals, Kinetiq, Hyena… these aren’t teams “farming yield.” They’re paying a blood tax in permanent supply reduction just to turn the lights on. The Dutch auction runs every 31 hours like clockwork. It’s not a narrative. It’s a burn calendar. You can literally set your watch to the thing deleting tokens.

Then half the fees from every single one of these markets flow into the Assistance Fund, whose only job is to buy HYPE and delete it. The other half goes to the deployer, who can buy a Lambo or burn it for clout—the protocol does not give a shit. When someone flips on “Growth Mode” and taker fees go to 0.5 bps? Protocol doesn’t bleed. It just waits for volume to 30x because everyone piles in for cheap leverage, then quietly eats a fixed percentage of a comically larger pie. The deployers slaughter each other over scraps. Hyperliquid gets fat on the bodies.

## Main

Liquidity can’t leave because every market shares the same order book. You’re not rotating from Felix to Nunchi—you’re just changing seats in the same coliseum. The more brutal the fee war, the more fees the AF collects, the more HYPE vanishes forever. It’s value accrual through engineered cannibalism. I swear this thing gets stronger the more its children try to kill each other.

And the higher the price goes, the cheaper it gets—in real dollars—to launch the next market. At $60, that 500 k HYPE stake still costs fifteen million fiat. Same as it did at $30. Every leg up lowers the barrier for the next wave of lunatics who were priced out last month. It’s reflexive. Sorros would cream his pants.

Remember 2021 when I shilled some random perps fork because they had “better UX” and then the team rugged six weeks later and I lost like 40 ETH? Yeah. I still have the DMs from readers calling me a moron. Fair. This feels different because the value capture doesn’t depend on any individual team not being greedy idiots. They can all be greedy idiots. The base layer still eats.

Tokenized stocks already did billions in notional with zero marketing. Now throw in treasuries, forex, commodities, prediction markets, every dumb event contract under the sun. Hyperliquid isn’t fighting Aevo or Drift anymore. It’s going after the shady offshore brokers who’ve been fleecing retail leverage traders for a decade. That’s a trillion-dollar shadow market, and HIP-3 just handed every ambitious autist on earth a free hunting license paid for by HYPE holders.

Stakers are gonna get rekt. LSTs will trade at discounts. Deployers will flame out spectacularly. None of that matters to the marginal buyer of spot. You win when they succeed (supply compression) and you win when they fail (buybacks). The only losing move is staking.

This isn’t a yield story. It’s a “watch the supply gauge go down while revenue goes parabolic” story.

FDV south of fifteen billion. Monthly revenue already pushing a billion annualized. Assistance Fund sitting on hundreds of millions in dry powder. Supply schedule that looks like a horror movie for bags.

I’m not saying it’s going to a hundred billion or whatever. Could be wrong here; I’ve definitely been wrong before. But the asymmetry feels obscene.

The deployers will bleed.
The stakers will scream on Twitter.
The Assistance Fund will keep buying.
And the token will just… compound.

## Conclusion

Anyway. I’m gonna finish this superb wine and try to sleep.

Next time you’re doomscrolling the Hyperliquid dashboard at 2 a.m., just watch the AF wallet for ten minutes. See how much gets deleted while you sit there. Then you tell me I’m full of shit.
