Picture this: While the rest of crypto is busy rage-posting about the next 10x gem or crying over their 50x leveraged long that just got rekt by a Tuesday in November, one absolute chad is quietly printing $1,000 every single week like it’s a subscription box.

No spot bags.\*\*No leverage tears.
Just pure, unfiltered, front-run premium from the most schizophrenic token on the market: $HYPE.

## Context

Act I – The Dip That Started It All\*\*

Late October. HYPE is bleeding from $45 to $30 on unlock FUD. Everyone’s calling for sub-$20. Our hero smells blood and deploys the classic combo:

- $39K collateral → sell 1,300 covered calls @ $32 strike

## Main

- $20K cash → sell puts @ $30 strike, hoping for one last flush to BTFD

Total premium collected on day one: $1,200. Mood: “If this thing dumps, I buy cheaper. If it pumps, I still get paid. Either way, I’m eating.”

**Act II – The Cruelest Plot Twist**

The market, being the sadistic comedian it is, refuses to go below $30 again.\*\*Instead it rips straight to $35 in four days. Covered calls are now deep ITM.
Opportunity cost calculator starts screaming: “You left $4,000 on the table, bro.” The chad does not rage. He does not FOMO buy the top. He simply zooms out, laughs, and says:“ Wait… why am I even pretending to care about spot price?
I’m not a HYPE maxi. I’m a premium maxi.”

Act III – Enlightenment on Hypersurface\*\*

Revelation hits harder than a HyperBFT block: Hyperliquid doesn’t let you close or roll these “options” early. They’re set-it-and-forget-it yield vaults in disguise. So instead of fighting the platform, he embraces it. He goes full delta-neutral strangle farmer: Every week after settlement:

- Take the freshly freed $60K war chest

- Sell the week’s covered calls 5–7% OTM

- Sell the week’s secured puts 5–7% OTM

- Collect $900–$1,200 upfront like clockwork

- Go touch grass (or stare at the chart, same thing)

No leverage.\*\*No liquidation.
Just pure theta decay and IV crush every single week.

Act IV – The Math That Makes Degens Cry\*\*

At current IV (80–100%), a balanced strangle on HYPE is paying 1.5–2.0% per week in premium. That’s 90–120% annualized yield on collateral that never actually leaves your wallet (except when it briefly turns into spot and immediately gets wheeled back into the next strangle). It’s the wheel, but on cocaine and fully automated by Hyperliquid’s refusal to let you overtrade.

**Epilogue – The North Star**

While everyone else is gambling on direction, our anon has achieved what every options seller dreams of: He turned the most controversial, supply-shocked, FUD-riddled token of 2025 into his personal ATM.

No hopium.
No copium.
Just premium.

So next time you see HYPE dump 15% in a day and the timeline is in shambles, just remember: somewhere out there, one beautiful bastard is smiling, because his puts just printed and his calls are about to get assigned at a price he already got paid for twice.

## Conclusion

That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win crypto in 2025.

Keep farming, king.
The theta never sleeps.
