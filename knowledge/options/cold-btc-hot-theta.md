Things have changed. BTC no longer sits on an exchange. Not in a hardware wallet that lives in a drawer. Not even in a single country I can drive to. The keys are split across continents, buried in structures that would take coordinated teams weeks to compromise, even if someone knew exactly where to look (which they don’t). Some shards sit in bank vaults under names that have never touched crypto. Locked behind a dead-man switch that would scatter the coins to charity if I missed two consecutive check-ins. There is no single point of failure, no single human who can be threatened, and no home safe anyone can kick in at 3 a.m. That stack will never move until I am old or the world ends, whichever comes first. It earns nothing. It simply exists, silent and unreachable, like gold buried under a mountain no map remembers.

Everything else, everything we actually touch, lives in stables. We call it the yield bucket. It started life as USDC because that felt clean, but we are now almost entirely in USDT0 and USDH on HyperEVM. Native stables move in sub-seconds, cost pennies, and plug directly into spot, perps, and vaults without ever leaving the chain. No bridges, no wrapped tokens, no praying the portal doesn’t close while your money is inside. Just clean, instant liquidity where the action actually happens. Inside that bucket we do exactly one aggressive thing. We take a percentage of the portfolio and wheel HYPE on Hypersurface.

## Context

Every week that sliver earns 3–6 %, paid upfront in stables the second we hit deposit. 50–100 %+ annualized on the deployed capital, sometimes more when the perps lose their minds. The rest of the bucket sits in the safest, most boring corners of HyperEVM earning 8–20 % with zero active management.

**That’s the entire playbook. **

HYPE is the alt we respect most. Best tech, best teams, best tokenomics, and a volume flywheel ($6.5 B total perp OI, $1 B+ on HYPE itself) that isn’t going away. Every 20× long needs someone to sell them the option. We are that someone.

## Main

**Hypersurface turned the wheel into a light switch**

Deposit USDT0/USDH → vault auto-sells weekly covered calls or cash-secured puts → premium lands instantly → repeat. 

No Greeks. No margin calls. No babysitting.

Fully collateralized, Chainlink-settled, audited to death. It just works.

3–6 % weekly is live on the dashboard right now. Not a backtest. Not “up to.”
Just the same structural volatility premium that has existed since the airdrop, finally gift-wrapped for people who don’t run market-making firms.

Everything stays on HyperEVM. No Ethena, no Maker, no Pendle, no multi-chain yoga. Hyperliquid spot margin (USDT0/USDH) = 8–14 %. HLP Vault = 10–20 %. USDH native reserves = 8–12 % (Treasury-backed, 1:1 redeemable, pure fiat yield)

All liquid the same day. All native. All boring on purpose.

The Playbook, in Plain English

- 
Core wealth → BTC, geographically distributed, unreachable

- 
Yield bucket →100 % USDT0 + USDH on HyperEVM 

- 
Active wheel → Hypersurface HYPE vaults & HyperSurface.

- 
Everything else → HyperEVM-native parking earning 8–20 %,

## Conclusion

You don’t need fifty strategies to make your stables work harder than most people’s salaries. You need one chain that actually works, two native stablecoins, one killer options vault, and a handful of boring parking spots that earn from real volume instead of token printer go brrr.

That’s it. Bridge a little USDT0.
Drop a sliver into Hypersurface options.
Watch the premium hit your wallet before your coffee gets cold.
Then close the laptop, and go touch grass.
