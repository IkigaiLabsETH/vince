Last week, we made a calculated tweak to our $HYPE wheel: we rolled our covered calls from the $27 strike down to $26 for the January 23 expiry.

This move boosted weekly premiums to $2K+, pushing the annualized yield to ~118%—roughly double our prior setup—while still leaving meaningful upside capture if we get the 2026 breakout.

Position Recap

Core holding: 3,600 $HYPE tokens

Average entry: ~$25.45 (initial 3,400 at ~$25.50, added 200 more at $25.30)

Current strategy: Long spot + short Jan 23 $26 calls

Premium collected per roll: $2,000–$2,200

Effective weekly yield on cost: 1.5–2.2%

We didn’t chase this out of FOMO.

The market has cooled, implied volatility has ticked higher, and the setup screamed “harvest richer premiums without abandoning discipline.”

Why $26 Instead of $27 (or Higher)?

The lower strike sacrifices some theoretical upside in a sharp rally, but the math—and the crowd—strongly favors it right now:

Each $1 above $26 on assignment costs us $3,600 in unrealized gains.

The $26 strike adds ~$52K in annualized premium income vs higher strikes or parking in BTC yields.

If assigned at $26: ~2.4% capital gain + full premium retained, then immediate wheel reset.

If OTM: keep tokens + premium and roll again.

Recent scenario analysis (blending historical vol, delta, and fresh Polymarket probabilities) shows the $26 strike maximizes income in 70%+ of outcomes:

~50% probability of chop $25–$26 (premium kept, tokens retained)

~25–30% probability of closing above $27

~20–25% probability of dropping toward $24

Even if called away above $27, effective exit price lands ~$26.56–$26.60 (strike + prorated premium)—still a clean return on a short-term hold.

Polymarket Crowd Wisdom (as of Jan 17, 2026)

Polymarket’s active $HYPE markets are giving us an unusually clear read on crowd sentiment via implied probabilities.

Short-Term (January 2026 Price Ladder)

Volume: ~$205K

Key implied probs:

≥$30: 17%

≥$34: 4%

≥$38+: <1%

≤$20: 16%

≤$16: <2%

Traders assign low odds to any meaningful January pump and equally low odds to a crash. The highest-conviction outcome is range-bound chop in the mid-$20s—exactly the environment that makes tight $26 calls so attractive.

Longer-Term (2026 Price Targets)

Market: Will $HYPE reach $38 by Dec 31, 2026?
Volume: ~$86K across ladder
Implied prob ≥$38 sometime in 2026: 72%

Takeaway: Strong bullish conviction for +50%+ upside over the next ~11 months, pricing in tailwinds like HyperEVM, revenue share, buybacks, ecosystem growth, and potential ETF flows outweighing unlocks.

CEX Listing Sentiment

Market: Binance spot listing in 2026?
Volume: ~$216K (launched Jan 6)

Healthy early action signals real interest—a high Yes probability would be a major catalyst.

Overall, Polymarket is disciplined: cautious near-term (harvest vol now), convincingly bullish longer-term (bank on infra dominance later).

The Bigger Picture: Why We’re Back in $HYPE

Mid-2025, wheeling $HYPE was our highest-conviction income play. December’s drawdown to $22 flipped that temporarily; puts got exercised unfavorably, and we rotated into boring BTC yields over the holidays.

Hyperliquid’s fundamentals, however, never faltered:

69% perpetuals market share

$1.5–2.5M daily revenue run rate

OI +34% WoW

Aggression Fund buybacks burning ~$2M daily (offsetting 17–30% of unlocks)

Permissionless markets (HIP-3), spot equities (SMALL2000, USTECH), surging USDH volume

January’s tiny unlock (1.2M tokens, ~0.3% supply) was fully absorbed—price actually rose afterward.

Grayscale’s rumored ETF filing was the final trigger to re-enter at scale. $HYPE still offers ~2× the yield of BTC wheels with real fundamental buffers.

Current Market Setup

Spot today: $25.18–$25.28 (+1.2% intraday, +3.6% weekly).

Volume steady at $110–111M daily.

Technicals:

Support: $24.50–$25, double bottom $23.60–$24 holding

Resistance: $25.50–$26 cluster

RSI ~55, EMAs threatening bullish cross

BTC anchored near $95K, capping explosive beta

On-chain remains elite:

Daily revenue $1.5M+ (peaked $3.45M Jan 15) → annualized $653M–$1.26B

TVL $4.66B, DAUs 80K (2× GMX)

Forward P/E ~14 → undervalued given real yield accrual

Near-term overhangs: Tornado unstake queue (~1.18M tokens) ends Jan 21; February’s larger 9.9M unlock. History shows Hyperliquid absorbs supply well—post-Jan 21 clarity should remove the last cloud.

X sentiment ~65/35 bull/bear, with bulls focused on accumulation and bears on temporary overhangs. Consensus: milk IV, buy dips, wait for confirmation.

The $26 roll isn’t perfect—a violent move above $27 would sting—but the combined technical, on-chain, and Polymarket signals all point to chop/modest upside over the next week. Richer premiums are the higher-probability play.

This setup embodies what 2025–2026 taught us: fundamentals > flashes, and resilient infra protocols like Hyperliquid compound quietly but powerfully. Derivatives dominance, equity perp expansion, deeper integrations, and eventual ETF flows—backed by real buybacks—will keep accruing value to the token.

For now, we stay disciplined =>

harvest volatility, preserve capital, let the machine work.

DYOR / NFA.

Markets turn fast.

///

It’s been just over a week since our early January 2026 post, where we unpacked the pivot back from BTC safety mode into $HYPE’s high-conviction wheel—swapping our clean 1 BTC position for ~3,400 $HYPE at around $25.5, and grinding $2,000 weekly premiums on $27 strike covered calls.

That move wasn’t flip-flopping; it was evolution based on changing conditions, renewed conviction, and simple math. We highlighted how Hyperliquid’s protocol didn’t break amid the December steamroller: still dominating perp volume and revenue, aggressive buybacks outpacing unlocks, ecosystem expansions like new markets and HyperEVM upgrades, and the game-changing Grayscale ETF filing signaling institutional validation.

The math screamed opportunity—doubled yields versus BTC, with extra income cushioning dips like a $5 drop in ~5 weeks. We were excited to grind through 2026 on an asset embodying the shift to real infrastructure, pairing sustained paychecks with asymmetric upside.

Fast forward to today, January 16, 2026: Spot’s stabilized around the mid-$25s after a mid-week dip to $23.62, forming a potential double bottom and teasing early rebound signals. We’ve added 200 more $HYPE at $25.3 with some spare USDT, bringing our total stack to ~3,600, and we’re rolling the wheel forward—not to $27 this time, but to the $26 strike for the January 23 expiry.

This isn’t chasing vol; it’s refining the setup for even fatter premiums in a market that’s cooled off, while staying true to our core thesis of income in chop and upside capture in grinds higher.

Let’s break down the full rationale, weaving in the journey so far and why $26 feels like the optimal turn of the wheel right now.

Recapping the broader arc reminds us why we’re here: From mid-October to mid-December 2025, we wheeled aggressively on $HYPE—mostly covered calls, with occasional naked short puts for extra juice—harvesting over $11K in premiums and climbing to #2 on the leaderboard. Then the crash hit: $HYPE wicked to $22, our $27 puts exercised at bad prices, wiping $4.4K in profits and a $25K unrealized drawdown. We capitulated on the bounce, consolidating into BTC for safe, consistent 1-1.3% weekly yields through the holidays. It healed the bruise, but we never stopped watching Hyperliquid’s fundamentals hold strong.

The January unlock—milder than expected at just 1.2M tokens ($31M, 0.3% supply)—was absorbed seamlessly, with price ticking up post-event.

That resilience, plus the ETF catalyst, pulled us back for the doubled income and conviction play. Now, with the market digesting that cooldown, $26 amplifies what worked at $27: richer premiums from elevated IV on Hypersurface, without overcommitting in uncertain short-term waters.

The premium edge at $26 is the primary driver—over 118% APR, nearly doubling the 65% at $27 and boosting our weekly upfronts by ~$1,000 on the full position. That’s not just incremental; it supercharges the swap math we outlined last time. A $1 drop in $HYPE hits principal by $3,600 now (3.9% drawdown), but the extra premium versus BTC (or even our prior strike) annualizes to a $52K+ boost, covering that $5 drop in ~5 weeks of rolling.

In this setup, we’re collecting yields that turn moderate volatility into an ally, especially with our add-on lot—we’re happy as hell to flip those 200 at $26 for USDT plus $130 premium, resetting cleanly if assigned.

It’s the wheel at its best: If it expires worthless, keep the stack and roll; if called away, sell at $26 (a 2.4% gain from our blended entry) plus all collected premiums, evolving the position without emotional baggage.

Market conditions this week sealed the deal, with the cooldown creating an ideal environment for this lower strike. After broader crypto chop and exchange inflows fueled a bearish tilt, $HYPE’s rebound—up 8-12% from lows, with volume building and resistance tests at $26-27—shifts the vibe to neutral-bullish, but not explosive. Assignment odds sit at ~31% per platform models (real-world maybe 35-40% with momentum), higher than $27’s 20% but compensated by the yield premium.

In bear or base cases—further fades or flat chop, which our Monte Carlo sims (10,000 paths with neutral drift) peg at ~70% combined probability—the buffer shines, pocketing 2.6% weekly while holding for catalysts.

Bull scenarios lock in 4.5-4.6% total returns quickly, enforcing discipline in a high-beta asset that pumps and dumps harder than BTC. This aligns with our working-capital mindset: size it to swing, adapt if another steamroller hits, but skew positive with income hedging risks.

Unlocks and catalysts further tilt toward $26’s attractiveness.

The January event’s seamless absorption—offset by Assistance Fund buybacks burning $2M daily—reduces supply fears until February, underscoring post-unlock resilience and organic demand we flagged last week.

Pair that with the Grayscale ETF filing advancing (Delaware trusts registered, Q1 “Assets Under Consideration” list inclusion, VanEck parallels), and you’ve got institutional legitimacy brewing—potentially inflows for one of the youngest assets ever. Yet, in the 7-day expiry window, it’s more tailwind than immediate spark; X sentiment’s 70/30 bullish, with threads on revenue metrics, whale accumulation, and moat-widening (speed, liquidity, permissionless markets amid competition from Aster et al.). Current levels scream accumulation: undervalued on protocol metrics like 69% perp share, $1.5-2.5M daily revenue, 34% OI growth. $26 lets us milk IV from this buzz without capping too early if ETF progress accelerates.

Risks haven’t vanished—this isn’t BTC safety. $HYPE’s high-beta means another alt bleed or perp rotation could sting principal faster, with monthly unlocks and market risk-off lurking. But $26 mitigates by prioritizing yield in uncertainty, building on our conviction in the narrative: Hyperliquid as the king of on-chain derivatives, a revenue-generating machine with deflationary burns, no BS promises, and value accruing to holders.

We’re not back for hype; we’re back for dominance, and this strike refines the grind. Looking to 2026, as we reflected last time on 2025’s maturation crucible—hype fatigue giving way to basics and infrastructure—Hyperliquid embodies it perfectly. If execution continues—capturing global derivatives volume, shipping upgrades, riding ETF tailwinds—tokenomics compound seriously. Paired with these $2K+ weekly paychecks? Still asymmetric.

The wheel turns again, sharper this time. What about you? Dialing up yields on alts like $HYPE, or hugging BTC’s consistency? DYOR / NFA. Markets move fast.
