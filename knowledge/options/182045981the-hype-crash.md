GM everyone,

We’ve been running a pretty aggressive options yield strategy on Hyperliquid since mid-October 2025—mostly covered calls on HYPE via their native options market (“[Hypersurface](https://app.hypersurface.io/earn)”), with the occasional short put to wheel into more bag when premiums looked irresistible. 

## Context

Over these ~2 months, we’ve collected a total of $6,9K in premium.

This steady income stream helped us rack up serious points on the Hypersurface options leaderboard (currently sitting at #2) while keeping the core portfolio 80% BTC and the rest in stables. The setup has outperformed most funds and degen plays we’ve seen—consistent yield without leverage blowups.
**
But crypto doesn’t care about your leaderboard rank or your pretty premium chart. Today was a brutal reminder.

The Positions Heading Into Expiry**

## Main

- 
Long 1800 HYPE spot (bought around $33 average earlier in the cycle).

- 
Short 1800 × $31 calls (covered) → premium collected: ~1,011 USDT0.

- 
Short ~1261 × $27 puts (naked) → premium collected: ~466 USDT0.

Total premium in on these trades: ~1,477 USDT0. Felt great when opened.

Then HYPE dumped hard—spot around $22.23, down (~60% from its Sept ATH)

**What Happened at Expiry**

- 
The $31 covered calls (Hyperliquid auto-settlement)**Deep OTM. Expired worthless.
→ Kept the full 1,011 USDT0 premium.
→ Kept the original 1800 HYPE spot.

- 
The $27 puts
$5 ITM. Auto-exercised.
→ Forced to buy additional 1261 HYPE at $27 ($34,043 outlay).
→ Immediate intrinsic loss of ~$5 per token.
→ After premium credit → net loss on the put leg: ~$5,838.

Overall options P&L for this expiry: ~-4.4k USDT0.
Final holding: ~3061 HYPE total.
> 
New average cost: ~$30.37 (averaged down from original $33, but still deep underwater). Classic steamroller moment on the short puts. Unrealized if sell all today: ~$24-25k loss locked in at the absolute low. This crash looks like classic overshoot panic. A modest 10% bounce to ~$25 already cuts the drawdown to ~$17k; recovery to $30 gets us nearly flat. No full capitulation at the wick low. Patience while we wait for IV spike and juicier calls later.

Post-Expiry Thoughts: To Wheel or Not to Wheel?**

We eyed rolling into new covered calls:

- 
Weekly (12/26) strikes: Trash premiums—post-crash low IV = tiny yields.

- 
Monthly (1/16/2026) strikes: Better but still thin (~88% APR on $23 strike = ~2.2% over 4 weeks; safer strikes ~1%).

We passed. Capital protection trumps forced yield when IV is crushed and the underlying looks overcorrected (Hyperliquid still leads perp volume, orderbook model intact, ecosystem expanding). Leaderboard points are tempting, but chasing thin premiums risks turning a winning strategy into a mediocre one.

**Bigger Picture Takeaways**

- 
The wheel thrives in range-bound or moderately bullish markets with high IV—Hyperliquid’s low-fee, efficient options market makes it very potent.

- 
It hurts badly on unexpected alt bleeds.

- 
Keeping HYPE as our only alt isolated the damage

- 
Post-loss emotions: Capitulation tempted (sell → USDT0 → maybe BTC puts). We resisted. This feels like classic cycle overshoot, not full breakdown.

**
Next moves: Hold naked? Wait for bounce/IV spike before re-engaging covered calls on Hyperliquid? Partial trim? We decided to swap to 1 uBTC.

Portfolio Pivot TLDR (Dec 19, 2025): Capitulated the HYPE bag at the bounce ($24) → swapped into USDT0 → consolidated into **1 full BTC** exposure (clean derisk, isolated the ~$20k alt loss). Now all-in BTC (~$88k spot), eyeing Hyperliquid covered calls for recovery yield.

Top Play: Sell $90k weekly calls (12/26 expiry)

- 
Upfront premium: $1,107 USDT0 (1.3% weekly yield → 69% APR)

- 
Sell probability: 34.6% (good odds of keeping BTC + premium)

- 
If assigned: Effective sell at ~$91.1k (happy exit in a moon scenario)

> 
Juicy IV pre-big Dec 26 expiry = fat premiums. Perfect wheel setup on the asset we’re most bullish on long-term. Pulling the trigger—steady income to grind back the drawdown. No more alt stress. BTC wheel mode activated.

Fingers crossed for no violent short squeeze to $100k+. Ideal: BTC chops $85-92k → keep premium + BTC → roll next week for another ~$1,100 paycheck. Wheel turning strong—steady income on pure BTC exposure. Recovery grind activated.

Perspective on the Journey So Far**

We’ve only been wheeling HYPE options for about two months (since mid-October), yet we’ve already harvested nearly $7,9K in premium on ~$472k peak notional. That’s a respectable yield in any market, especially while riding one of the wildest alt cycles. Today’s ~$4.4k hit stings, but it’s a single expiry in a multi-month strategy that’s still solidly positive on collected premium. 
**
The real win is the lessons: size conservatively, respect crashes, and never force trades in low-IV environments. Learning in public means posting the wins and the bruises. This bruise will heal, and it’ll make the next leg up even sweeter when we sell those fat calls again. Still long-term bullish on the Hyperliquid ecosystem. BTC heavy and cruising.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Options Yield Strategies:** Utilizing covered calls and naked puts to generate consistent income while managing risk.
- **Market Volatility and Implied Volatility (IV):** Understanding how market conditions impact option prices and the importance of IV in decision-making.
- **Portfolio Diversification vs. Concentration:** Balancing between holding multiple assets versus concentrating on fewer for risk management.
- **Emotional Resilience in Trading:** Maintaining composure during market downturns to avoid impulsive decisions.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Assess the current market environment and volatility levels before deploying options strategies. This involves evaluating the historical performance of assets and predicting potential movements based on market sentiment.
- Continuously monitor the performance of your portfolio against the backdrop of broader market trends, particularly focusing on the correlation between asset classes (e.g., crypto and traditional assets).
- Use a combination of technical analysis and market sentiment to inform decisions on when to enter or exit positions.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Identify signs of market overreactions, such as sharp price declines (panic selling) followed by quick recoveries. This can indicate potential reversal points.
- Recognize the behavior of options premiums post-market events (e.g., earnings reports, regulatory news) to gauge whether premiums are sustainable or indicative of market fear.
- Monitor the liquidity and volume in the options market to determine the health and efficiency of the trading environment.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Implement a "wait and see" approach during periods of high volatility, focusing on capital preservation rather than forced yield generation. Prioritize rolling into new positions only when favorable conditions (high IV and better premiums) arise.
- Utilize a tiered approach to risk management by diversifying investments across various asset classes while maintaining a core position in a stable asset (e.g., BTC).
- Develop a clear exit strategy for both winning and losing trades, enabling you to capitalize on gains or minimize losses without emotional interference.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodologies that emphasize risk management, emotional control, and strategic timing.
- Extract actionable insights that can be adapted to various trading scenarios in both bullish and bearish markets.
- Keep the framework adaptable to the evolving landscape of options trading and broader financial markets.

UPDATE: **Relief Bounce & Strategy Pivot Thoughts

After yesterday’s painful expiry and panic wick to ~$22, HYPE showed real strength overnight and is bouncing ~9% to $24.40 with solid volume ($3B+ 24h) and stable OI ($2.4B). No follow-through selling; buyers defended the low.

- 
Unrealized loss on the ~3061 bag shrunk from ~$25k (at lows) to ~$19k.

- 
Portfolio now: 0.14 BTC + 3061 HYPE (~$86k total equiv).

Considering swapping HYPE → USDT0 → BTC (adding ~0.83 BTC exposure for full ~0.97 BTC stack) to derisk alts completely and wheel juicy BTC covered calls (weeklies paying 0.5-1% on conservative strikes). But the bounce flipped sentiment, so this looks like oversold relief, not dead cat.

Current plan: Hold for now (or partial trim at strength). Let momentum play out toward $27-30 retest before deciding full pivot. Hyperliquid fundamentals unchanged; competition FUD real but often overblown in thin markets.

One rough expiry doesn’t kill the wheel.

Yes, a short squeeze (or at least a sharp upside move) into/after Dec 26 is a plausible scenario, but it’s not the only outcome. Why a Short Squeeze is Possible:

- 
Massive $23-24B BTC options OI expiring Dec 26 (mostly Deribit)—one of the largest ever.

- 
Heavy concentration of puts around $80-85k (downside protection bought by bulls) and calls $100k+ (upside bets).

- 
Dealers are short gamma below ~$90-95k → to stay delta-neutral, they’ve been selling futures/BTC spot as price dips, suppressing upside and pinning the range.

- 
If BTC holds/stabilizes into expiry and those puts expire worthless, dealers unwind hedges → forced buying pressure (gamma squeeze higher).

- 
Add thin holiday liquidity + any positive catalyst (ETF flows, macro relief) → classic setup for a violent short squeeze toward $95-100k+.

But It’s Not Guaranteed

- 
If bears win and we break below $85k put wall pre-expiry, the unwind could go the other way (long liquidations → downside acceleration).

- 
Max pain is drifting higher (~$90-95k zone), but skew still slightly put-heavy → more risk of downside flush first.

- 
Larry Fink’s point about “leveraged players” holds: until they’re cleared out (via expiry or cascading liqs), vol stays artificially low.

Bottom line: Dec 26 expiry could absolutely “release the hose” and spark a short squeeze if bulls defend $85-88k into it. High-conviction upside scenario if we close the week strong. Watch gamma exposure and funding rates closely—vol resumption either way likely. What’s your bet? Patience mode activated.

**Outro: Reflections on 2025 & What Lies Ahead for 2026**
> 
As 2025 draws to a close, it’s hard not to look back at a year that promised so much yet delivered a brutal reality check for crypto. We entered with a pro-crypto, pro-AI U.S. president, clearer regulations, ETF approvals, institutional inflows, and enterprise blockchain adoption on the horizon. Instead, we got a massacre: most alts down 80-99%, Bitcoin dominance surging back to 2019-2020 levels (>60%), ETH stuck at 2022 prices, and equities decisively outperforming crypto despite all the “positive” headlines.

This wasn’t a bull market, it was a maturation crucible. Tens of millions of tokens flooded the market in a fragmented frenzy, narratives rotated in days rather than weeks, and countless participants exited the space in pain. For those still here, 2025 taught us resilience, humility, and the value of real fundamentals over hype. So, for everyone grinding into 2026, here are the key lessons and trends that will shape the year ahead:

## Conclusion

> 
‘24-’25 felt like Monopoly: easy money, wild narratives, number-go-up chaos. ‘26 will feel like real corporations and startups: fundamentals, alignment, value accrual, compounding leverage, and far less free lunch. The suits are coming. Easy gains are fading. For those still here: stay hungry, stay foolish. 

See you stronger in 2026.
