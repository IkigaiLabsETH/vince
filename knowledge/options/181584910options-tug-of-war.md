As we close out 2025, Bitcoin traders are left scratching their heads at a stubborn paradox. Gold has rocketed over 60% year-to-date, trading around $4,300 an ounce amid central bank hoarding and debasement fears. The Magnificent 7 stocks have charged ahead on AI momentum and robust fundamentals. Yet Bitcoin—often hailed as “digital gold”—has spent much of the year trapped in a frustrating sideways range around $90,000, with spot prices hovering near $90,200 as of December 14.

Strong ETF inflows and favorable macros should propel it higher, but something holds it back. The answer lies in the derivatives market, specifically the relentless covered call selling by early Bitcoin whales on platforms like Deribit.
> 
These OG holders, with coins bought at rock-bottom prices years ago, avoid dumping spot outright (which would tank the price and hurt their own holdings). Instead, they sell out-of-the-money calls against their stacks, pocketing rich premiums for steady yield. Dealers hedge this flood of short calls by selling rallies and buying dips, erecting a persistent “call wall” that caps upside and suppresses volatility.

## Context

To grasp why this dynamic has proven so durable—and why 2025 felt like endless chop—we need to break down two key options concepts: delta and vega.

Delta and Vega: The Basics**

- 
Delta — Measures directional exposure. A call option has positive delta (it gains value if the underlying price rises). Selling a call adds negative delta—essentially a mild bet the price won’t surge past the strike. When whales sell covered calls en masse, dealers end up short those calls and hedge by selling Bitcoin on strength (negative delta offset).

## Main

- 
Vega — Measures sensitivity to volatility. Options love big swings: higher expected volatility inflates premiums. Selling options (calls or puts) is short vega—you profit when volatility falls or stays low. A barrage of call selling floods the market with vega supply, driving implied volatility (IV) lower.

Most analyses spotlight the delta drag: sold calls create overhead supply, pinning price through dealer hedging. That’s valid and explains short-term mean reversion. But the deeper, longer-lasting culprit is vega selling. Quarter after quarter, whales overwrite their holdings, dumping massive vega into the system. [This crushes IV—currently in the low-to-mid 40s, down from 63% peaks in November](https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/volatility-index)—building an options structure that actively fights explosive moves. Dealers wind up long gamma (they hedge to dampen swings, pulling price back to the middle). The result? Multi-month ranges that exhaust bulls, turning Bitcoin into a trader’s grind instead of the asymmetric rocket many expect.

The Counterforce: ETF Options and the Path to a Breakout**

A rival dynamic is brewing in regulated U.S. ETF options, esp. BlackRock’s IBIT.

The venues split sharply:

- 
Deribit (crypto-native): OG-dominated covered call selling → cheap upside calls (negative skew) → positive gamma and vol suppression.

- 
IBIT (institutional): Fresh capital buys ETF shares outright (new delta demand) and often buys upside calls → richer upside vols (positive skew) → negative gamma that can accelerate squeezes.

IBIT options have ballooned, with open interest frequently rivaling or exceeding Deribit’s massive notional (~$40-50B peaks). This is new money fueling speculation and volatility demand.

IBIT’s Momentum Has Faded (Dec 14, 2025)

These two charts on BlackRock’s IBIT deliver a clear message about why Bitcoin’s potential “ETF dominance” catalyst stalled in 2025:

- 
AUM: Exploded from $25-30B early-year to a peak ~$100-110B mid-year, but retreated to **$70-75B** by December—hit by both BTC price stagnation and outflows.

- 
Daily Flows: Strong positive inflows (up to $1B+ days) through mid-2025 flipped to persistent negatives/outflows in Q4 (heaviest redemption cycle on record).

[
![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9bc3a73-135d-4370-9c9a-fd089eff871e_3074x826.jpeg)

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!63c9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9bc3a73-135d-4370-9c9a-fd089eff871e_3074x826.jpeg)
Key lesson: The fresh institutional demand (new delta + upside vol buying via IBIT options) that was supposed to counter Deribit’s OG call-selling supply has dried up dramatically. Without sustained ETF inflows, there’s no real force to inject negative gamma or vol demand—leaving the call wall, positive gamma pinning, and crushed IV fully in control.

Sobering update: The hoped-for flip to ETF-driven upside isn’t happening yet. Late-2025 outflows reinforce why BTC stays pinned at ~$90k while the yield farm thrives. Watch for inflow reversal in 2026; until then, chop persists.
> 
The tipping point arrives when ETF options dominate flows. Negative gamma from IBIT upside buyers overpowers Deribit’s positive gamma supply, allowing IV to expand and ranges to shatter—potentially unleashing the melt-up Bitcoin bulls crave.

For now, the old guard’s yield machine prevails, quietly taxing upside while gold and stocks soar. It’s ironic: the freedom asset stays range-bound partly due to its most dedicated holders’ income play.

Watch the venue battle, the skew divergence, the gamma shift. When vol demand finally eclipses supply, the next leg up begins. Until then, patience—or nimble trading—in this gauntlet. The cycle turns when the volatility does.

This BTC ATM Implied Volatility chart (updated Dec 14, 2025) tells the story of the year’s biggest paradox in one clean picture:

- 
IV across all tenors (7-day to 180-day) has steadily collapsed from ~60-70% early in the year to the low-to-mid 40s by December—a historically suppressed level.

- 
Short-term vols spike briefly (e.g., November ~63%) but quickly revert; longer-dated vols grind relentlessly lower with a flat term structure.

- 
Result: The market prices in minimal big swings ahead, despite favorable macros and ETF inflows.

Key takeaway: Relentless vega selling—mostly from OG whales overwriting calls on Deribit—continues to dominate, flooding volatility supply, building positive gamma, and pinning Bitcoin in multi-month chop around $90k.

No sign yet of the hoped-for flip from IBIT options demand. The “call wall” and yield-farming machine remain firmly in control, explaining why gold soared to ~$4,300 and stocks ripped while BTC lagged in a trader’s gauntlet.

Frustrating confirmation: volatility suppression is alive and well. Watch for any sustained IV lift in 2026 as the potential breakout signal. 

Until then, more of the same.

Deribit’s Textbook Call Wall (Mid-Dec 2025)

This CoinGlass chart of Deribit BTC options open interest by strike is pure visual confirmation of the ongoing “yield farm” pinning Bitcoin at ~$90k:

- 
Massive call overhang: Towering OI in OTM calls from $95k–$140k+ (311k contracts, ~$27.8B notional)—classic covered call selling by OGs renting out upside.

- 
Thin puts: Scattered and tiny below spot (166k contracts, ~$14.9B notional).

- 
Put/Call Ratio: 0.35 → Almost 2x more calls than puts.

- 
Total OI: ~$42.7B.

Key lesson: Whales keep overwriting stacks → dealers hedge with mean-reversion (sell rallies, buy dips) → volatility crushed, upside capped, price glued in range. No downside fear, all upside “sold” for premiums. Explains BTC’s 2025 lag vs. gold ($4,300+) and stocks. The old guard’s machine is still running strong—no flip to ETF dominance yet. Frustrating, but the wall couldn’t be clearer.

Deribit Dealer Greeks – The Pinning Engine Exposed (Mid-Dec 2025)

This CoinGlass chart of Deribit BTC options Greeks by strike is the clearest proof yet of why Bitcoin stays stuck around $90k–$91k:

- 
Positive Gamma Peak: Tall hump right at spot → dealers dynamically buy dips and sell rallies to stay neutral → powerful mean reversion, magnetic pinning.

- 
Net Delta: Mildly positive overhead → caps upside strength.

- 
Theta: Deeply negative near spot → time decay rewards sellers (whales farming premiums).

- 
Vega: Large positive cluster → dealers profit from low/crushed volatility.

Bottom line: Heavy covered call selling creates long gamma/vega for dealers → actively dampens swings, keeps IV low, and turns potential trends into chop.

The OG yield farm’s hedging machine is in full control—no negative gamma fuel from ETF flows yet. Pure confirmation of 2025’s frustrating range while gold and stocks moon. The wall (and pin) lives on.

Deribit Max Pain – The Expiry Magnet (Mid-Dec 2025)

This CoinGlass Max Pain chart for Deribit BTC options is another stark confirmation of the pinning dynamic:

- 
Max Pain Level: Sitting right at ~$90,000 for the massive Dec 26, 2025 quarterly expiry (tallest notional bar ~$35B+).

- 
Current spot (~$90,200–$90,500) is hugging max pain almost perfectly.

Key lesson: Heavy OTM call selling makes $90k the strike where most options expire worthless → maximum profit for sellers (OG whales) and pain for buyers. Dealers’ hedging pulls price toward this level into expiry (sell strength, buy weakness). Combined with positive gamma, call wall, and crushed IV, it’s the full toolkit keeping BTC in chop while gold ($4,300+) and stocks run free.

Expect mechanical flows to anchor spot near $90k through Christmas expiry. The yield farm’s “magnet” is switched on—post-expiry roll will tell if the wall rebuilds. Still no breakout in sight.
> 
While the derivatives-driven call wall and vega suppression remain the primary forces pinning Bitcoin in this multi-month range, other headwinds have contributed to 2025’s relative underperformance. Macro uncertainties—including the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on further rate cuts beyond the December 25bps reduction (leaving the fed funds rate at 3.5-3.75%) and cooling labor market signals—have reinforced Bitcoin’s correlation with risk assets like equities. On-chain dynamics, such as ongoing distribution from long-term holders, have added supply pressure amid inconsistent ETF inflows. These elements compound the options structure’s dampening effect, explaining why BTC has lagged gold’s surge to ~$4,300 and stock market gains despite favorable long-term narratives.

Protecting a Core BTC Position with Long-Dated Puts**

If the “call wall” finally cracks and we enter a deeper bear phase (BTC sub-$70k or worse), buying long-dated out-of-the-money (OTM) put options is one of the cleanest ways to hedge your core spot holdings without selling BTC outright. This acts like portfolio insurance: limited downside cost (the premium), uncapped protection if prices tank. Pure on-chain or DeFi options rarely offer truly long-dated puts (mostly weekly/monthly). Centralized crypto venues are better. Top Platforms for Long-Dated BTC Puts (as of Dec 14, 2025)

Deribit (Best for Longest Dated & Liquidity)Longest expiries: Up to 2+ years out (e.g., Dec 2026, Jun 2027, or even Dec 2027 quarterly series often listed).

- 
Deep liquidity in OTM puts (strikes 20-50% below spot, e.g., $50k–$70k puts for ~$90k spot).

- 
European-style, cash-settled in BTC—no forced exercise issues.

- 
Funding: Direct USDC/USDT/BTC deposits (no fiat conversion/tax trigger if you send stables).

- 
Strategy tip: Buy 20-40% OTM puts (e.g., $60k strike) expiring Dec 2026 or later. Premiums are cheap in low-IV environment (currently low 40s)—expect 2-5% of notional cost for decent protection. Roll annually if needed.

**Recommended Hedge Setup**

- 
Core protection: Allocate 1-3% of portfolio value to premiums.

- 
Deribit route: Cheaper premiums, more tail protection.

**
This avoids the need to sell spot. In a real bear (e.g., 2022-style drawdown), these puts could 10-20x, fully offsetting core losses. Monitor IV—it’s crushed now, so puts are historically cheap. If vol spikes on a breakdown, premiums rise fast (buy early). Stay nimble; this is insurance, not a bet against BTC long-term. If we moon instead, premium lost is the cost of peace of mind.

Practical Example: Hedging 1 BTC Core Position with Long-Dated Puts**

Let’s scale down the earlier example to 1 BTC (current spot ~$90,000 as of Dec 14, 2025, portfolio value ~$90,000). Core protection guideline: Allocate 1-3% of portfolio value to option premiums for meaningful tail-risk insurance.

- 
Target spend: $900–$2,700 on premiums.

- 
Goal: Cover 50-100% notional downside below $60k–$70k (protecting against a 30-45% drawdown, similar to past bears).

**
Realistic Setup on Deribit (Recommended for Longest Dated & Crypto-Native Funding) Deribit offers expiries up to ~18-24 months (e.g., Dec 2026 often available, with far OTM puts like $20k–$60k strikes showing OI). In the current low-IV environment (mid-40s), far OTM long-dated puts are relatively cheap (~0.02–0.06 BTC premium per contract for deep protection).

Example trade:**

Buy 1 x BTC put expiring Dec 2026 (or nearest long-dated):

- 
Strike: $60,000 (33% OTM – solid protection starting below ~$60k).

- 
Estimated premium: 0.025–0.045 BTC ($2,250–$4,050 USD at spot – but adjust for actual mark; fits over our 1-3% if on the lower end).

- 
Cost: ~2–4.5% of portfolio (slightly above guideline for full 1:1 notional coverage, but provides strong hedge).

- 
Payoff: If BTC drops to $40k by expiry, put worth ~0.333 BTC (strike - spot, settled in BTC) – massive offset to your spot loss.

**For cheaper (1-3% spend):**

- 
Buy a deeper OTM put (e.g., $50,000 strike) – premium ~0.015–0.03 BTC ($1,350–$2,700).

- 
Covers catastrophic downside (below 45% drop) while staying in budget – acts as true “insurance” (pays out big only in severe bear).

**Why this works:**

- 
Limited risk (max loss = premium paid).

- 
No need to sell spot (stay HODL).

- 
In a bear (BTC to $50k), your 1 BTC spot loses ~$40k, but put gains offset most/all.

- 
If BTC moons, lose only the premium – cheap cost for peace of mind.

**
[Check Deribit directly for live quotes](https://www.deribit.com/options/BTC/BTC-26DEC25) (premiums fluctuate with IV/spot). Buy now while IV is low for best pricing. Roll if expiry approaches without event. This is insurance – worth it if you’re worried about a deeper correction.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Delta and Vega**: Understanding these two key options metrics is crucial for analyzing price dynamics. Delta measures directional exposure, while Vega gauges sensitivity to volatility.
- **Covered Call Selling**: The practice of selling call options against existing holdings to generate income while mitigating risk, particularly prevalent among Bitcoin whales.
- **Dealer Hedging**: Recognizing how market makers adjust their positions in response to massive call selling and how this influences market volatility and price action.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Adopt a dual-layer analysis: first, evaluate the immediate effects of delta and vega on market conditions, and second, assess the long-term implications of these derivatives strategies on price movements. This involves monitoring the interplay between call selling by whales and dealer hedging practices to understand their cumulative effect on Bitcoin’s market behavior.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for signs of heavy covered call selling, especially during periods of low volatility, as this may indicate suppressed price movement and the potential for sudden shifts. Additionally, monitor changes in implied volatility (IV) for signals on future price swings; a downward trend in IV suggests a stable market environment that may lead to prolonged consolidation.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Apply a comparative analysis of different trading venues (e.g., Deribit vs. IBIT) to evaluate how the distinct participant profiles (OGs vs. institutional investors) shape market dynamics. Utilize this insight to inform trading strategies—consider positioning for potential breakouts or retracements based on shifts in delta demand and gamma exposure. 

**Important Notes:**
- This methodology emphasizes a holistic understanding of options mechanics and market psychology rather than focusing on specific historical data points or outcomes. By mastering these frameworks, traders can better navigate the complexities of the options market and optimize their strategies in real-time.

Update: The feedback we received from a fellow trader is spot-on and captures the core idea of our article perfectly. It’s praising our explanation of how options dealers’ hedging (especially in crypto on platforms like Deribit) has become a dominant force in driving price action, often overriding fundamentals like news or ETF flows. Let me break down the key parts of his comment step by step.

1. Overall Agreement: Structural Positioning > Fundamentals

- 
The commenter agrees that modern markets (especially Bitcoin in 2025) are increasingly controlled by options dealers’ gamma hedging rather than pure supply/demand from spot buying/selling or macro news.

- 
In our article, this is the main thesis: Heavy covered call selling by early Bitcoin holders (”OG whales”) on Deribit creates a massive “call wall.” Dealers (market makers) end up long gamma (positive GEX) because they’re short those calls and hedge dynamically. This pins BTC in a range around ~$90k (near max pain), suppresses volatility (IV collapse to mid-40s%), and creates mean reversion despite bullish fundamentals.

2. Positive GEX (High and Positive Gamma Exposure): Dealers as “Shock Absorbers”

When dealers are long gamma (positive GEX, as in the current Deribit setup):

- 
They buy dips (to hedge increasing delta as price falls) and sell rallies (to hedge as price rises).

- 
This acts as a stabilizing force: It dampens moves, pulls price back toward high-gamma strikes (like max pain at $90k), and keeps the market range-bound.

- 
Result: Low volatility, “pinning” to certain levels, and mean reversion. Dealers are effectively fighting trends to stay delta-neutral.

3. Negative GEX: Dealers “Chase the Price” and Accelerate Moves

When GEX flips negative (dealers become short gamma overall):

- 
They must sell as price drops (hedging worsens the fall) and buy as price rises (fueling the rally).

- 
This creates a feedback loop: Moves accelerate, volatility expands, and trends can run farther/faster (e.g., potential melt-ups or crashes).

- 
In our article, this is the “gamma flip” scenario—e.g., if ETF options (like IBIT) dominate with buyers purchasing upside calls, it could inject negative gamma, overpowering Deribit’s positive gamma supply and shattering the range.

4. The Commenter’s Theoretical Trading Application

This is a solid, practical extension of our ideas:

- 
Positive/high GEX → Sell volatility (short vega): Strategies like Iron Condors (sell out-of-the-money call and put spreads) or Strangles (sell OTM calls and puts) thrive here. Why? Dealers’ hedging pins price in a range, volatility stays low/crushed, and time decay (theta) works in your favor as a premium seller. You’re betting on continuation of the low-vol, range-bound environment our article describes.

- 
Gamma Flip to Negative GEX → Go long vega (or breakout plays): Buy volatility (e.g., long straddles/strangles, or directional options) because dealers’ chasing will amplify moves, causing IV to spike and bigger price swings. Alternatively, directional breakout trades (e.g., momentum longs on upside breaks) as the “call wall” crumbles.

This strategy aligns directly with our conclusion: The current Deribit-dominated positive gamma setup favors vol sellers (yield farming via covered calls), but a shift (e.g., renewed ETF call buying) could flip it and enable explosive trends. Overall, the feedback is essentially saying: “Great job explaining this structural tug-of-war—here’s how I’d trade it based on your analysis.” It’s high praise, as they’re building on our insights with actionable ideas. And this is why we write.

## Conclusion

---

Disclaimer:** Options trading is complex and involves significant risks, including the potential loss of your entire premium paid (which can expire worthless if Bitcoin does not move sufficiently in your favor). This strategy is not suitable for all investors and should only be considered by those with a high risk tolerance and thorough understanding of derivatives. It is not financial advice—consult a professional advisor, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Past performance or current low-IV environments do not guarantee future results.*
