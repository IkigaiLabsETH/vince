# 2026-02-03 — Session notes (VINCE)

**Decisions made**
- ALOHA run: vibe OK; perps + options fine for Friday prep. Paper bot idle (no trade without explicit command).
- Treadfi: MM + DN running (Long Nado / Short HL). Check treadtools.vercel.app for status.
- No strike changes until Friday.

**Context for next session**
- **ALOHA / Friday:** Check funding first (CoinGlass/Hyperliquid). Apply framework: crowded longs → wider calls, crowded shorts → tighter CSPs. HYPE: 1.5× width. Deribit for IV.
- **MOLT (AI meme):** LP pool on Meteora; waiting for pullback to DCA.
- **Lifestyle:** Wed hotel — Southwest France options (Palais Biarritz, Eugénie, Caudalie) if suggesting.

**Constraints**
- Focus on treadfi + strikes this week; skip new meme hunting.
- Season 1 treadfi ends May 18, 2026 — keep farming.
