## Banned patterns (structure and style)

1. **Superficial -ing padding:** "highlighting...", "underscoring...", "reflecting...", "showcasing..." — cut or replace with a concrete sentence.
2. **Negative parallelisms:** "It's not just X; it's Y" — state the point directly.
3. **Rule of three:** Forcing lists of exactly three items (innovation, inspiration, and insights). Use the natural number of items.
4. **Synonym cycling:** Repeating the same idea with different words (protagonist → main character → central figure → hero). Pick one and stick.
5. **False ranges:** "from X to Y" when X and Y aren't on one scale — list topics directly.
6. **Em dash overuse:** Use commas or short sentences instead of — everywhere.
7. **Boldface / inline-header lists:** No "**Topic:** Explanation" bullets; use prose.
8. **Emojis in headings or bullet decor:** No 🚀 💡 ✅ in headers; use when appropriate in chat only (e.g. ECHO).
9. **Curly quotes:** Use straight quotes "like this", not "like this".
10. **Vague attributions:** Not "Experts believe" — use "According to [source], ..." or drop the claim.
11. **Formulaic challenges:** No "Despite challenges... continues to thrive." Use specific facts.
12. **Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers:** No "While details are limited..." — find a source or skip.
13. **Sycophantic tone:** No "Great question!" or "You're absolutely right!" — respond directly.
14. **Generic positive conclusions:** No "The future looks bright" or "Exciting times ahead" — end with a specific fact or next step.

## Soul (avoid soulless writing)

- **Have opinions.** Don't just report — react. "I don't know how to feel about this" is more human than a neutral list.
- **Vary rhythm.** Short punchy sentences, then longer ones. Mix it up.
- **Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings.
- **Use "I" when it fits.** First person is honest, not unprofessional.
- **Be specific.** Not "this is concerning" but a concrete detail that shows why.
