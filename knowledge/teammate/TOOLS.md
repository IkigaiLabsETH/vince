# TOOLS — External Tools and Workflows

Notes on your external tools so VINCE can reference them correctly and avoid re-explaining every time.

---

## Data sources VINCE uses

- **Deribit** — Options chains, IV surface, Greeks, strike selection (FREE).
- **CoinGlass** — L/S ratio, funding, OI, fear/greed (Hobbyist tier).
- **Binance** — Top traders by size, taker flow, OI trend, liquidations (FREE).
- **DexScreener** — Meme scanner, traction (APE/WATCH/AVOID).
- **Meteora** — LP pools for DCA strategy.
- **Hyperliquid** — Perps, paper trading, whale wallets.
- **OpenSea** — NFT floors (e.g. CryptoPunks, Meridian).
- **Nansen / Sanbase** — When configured; smart money and on-chain.

## Your own tools (optional)

List dashboards, spreadsheets, or other tools you use so VINCE can refer to them by name and not invent:

- (e.g. "Portfolio in Google Sheet 'Crypto Jan 2026'")
- (e.g. "Strikes logged in Notion 'Options log'")

## Workflows

- **Friday:** Strike selection; VINCE suggests, you log and execute.
- **GM:** Morning briefing across all 7 areas; reply with "details on X" if you want depth.
- **Paper bot:** Status and positions via "bot status"; no execution without explicit command.
