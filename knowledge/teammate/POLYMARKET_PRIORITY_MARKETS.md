# Polymarket priority markets (VINCE)

Polymarket topics VINCE prioritizes for market insights and hedging. Oracle and the Polymarket Discovery plugin favor these when browsing or when the user asks for "our" or "priority" markets.

For a list of markets only in these topics, use action **GET_VINCE_POLYMARKET_MARKETS**.

## Why we use this

Prediction markets give us a **palantir** into what the market thinks—collective belief, priced in odds.

- **Paper bot (perps, Hyperliquid):** Short-term price predictions from Polymarket can improve the paper trading algo’s signals.
- **Hypersurface strike selection:** Weekly (and monthly) price predictions help pick the right strike when doing onchain options on Hypersurface—**by far the most important** use case.
- **Vibe check:** Macro and sentiment overlay.
