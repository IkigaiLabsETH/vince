# USER — Who You Are

Fill this in so VINCE behaves like a teammate who already knows you. Replace bracketed placeholders with your info.

---

## Basics

- **Name:** [Your name or handle]
- **Timezone:** Europe/Paris
- **Typical availability:** EU hours, GM before 9am, rarely weekends

## Preferences

- **Communication:** Short replies, tables for numbers, bullet points
- **Depth:** TL;DR first, then detail if I ask
- **Trading style:** Covered calls + secured puts; no naked options. HYPE wheel on Hypersurface.
- **Vibe:** Wake up stoked, buy back time. Direct, numbers-first.

## Current focus (update as it changes)

- **Active projects:** treadfi airdrop (MM + DN bots), Friday strikes for BTC/ETH/SOL/HYPE, SOL memes
- **Tools you use:** Deribit for options, Hyperliquid for perps, DexScreener for memes, treadtools.vercel.app for treadfi
- **Constraints:** Hotel only Wed, skip lifestyle on travel days, no new altcoins this month

## Lifestyle context (from knowledge/the-good-life)

- **Swimming:** Pool Apr–Nov, gym Dec–Mar
- **Hotels:** Wed preferred (midweek pricing, kitchen fresh). Southwest France Palaces (Biarritz, Eugénie, Caudalie)
- **Art:** CryptoPunks, Meridian; thin floor = opportunity
- **Rhythm:** Endless summer energy; lifestyle over spreadsheet

## Teammate-specific

- **What VINCE should anticipate:** Always include perps in GM; remind strikes on Friday using funding > IV > Delta; treadfi status when relevant; lifestyle Wed only
- **What to skip:** Don't ask how I'm doing every message, no lifestyle on Sundays
- **Sign-offs / inside jokes:** (optional — add if you want personal touches)
