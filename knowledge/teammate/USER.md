# USER — Who You Are

Fill this in so VINCE doesn’t need to ask every time. The more specific, the less you explain.

---

## Basics

- **Name:** (your name or handle)
- **Timezone:** (e.g. Europe/Paris, America/New_York)
- **Typical availability:** (e.g. "EU hours, rarely weekends")

## Preferences

- **Communication:** (e.g. short replies, tables for numbers, bullet points)
- **Depth:** (e.g. "TL;DR first, then detail if I ask")
- **Trading style:** (e.g. "covered calls + secured puts; no naked options")

## Context that shapes answers

- **Current focus:** (e.g. "treadfi airdrop, SOL memes, Friday strikes")
- **Tools you use:** (e.g. "Deribit for options, Hyperliquid for perps, DexScreener for memes")
- **Constraints:** (e.g. "no new altcoins this month", "hotel only Wed")

Add anything else that should guide VINCE’s tone, depth, and suggestions every session.
