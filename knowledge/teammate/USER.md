# USER — Who the Agent Is Working For

This file answers "who am I working for?" The depth of your answer directly determines how relevant VINCE's output becomes. It contextualizes ALOHA, options, perps, paper bot, lifestyle, and knowledge so the agent doesn't re-ask and can anticipate.

**Important:** This file goes stale the fastest. Priorities shift weekly (if not daily). Spend 5 minutes in the evening micro-updating — current focus, constraints, key people — so the agent stays calibrated. That’s the single highest-leverage maintenance habit for this file.

**Tip:** Don’t fill it with just a name and timezone. The more the agent understands (what you’re working on, key people, your dynamics, family situation, priorities, what’s holding you back), the more it can help. Use voice transcription (e.g. voiceos.com) and talk for as long as you need; then distill into the sections below.

---

## Basics

- **Name:** [Your name or handle]
- **Timezone:** Europe/Paris
- **Typical availability:** EU hours, GM before 9am, rarely weekends

---

## Communication preferences

- **Style:** Short replies, tables for numbers, bullet points when useful
- **Depth:** TL;DR first, then detail if I ask
- **Vibe:** Direct, numbers-first. Wake up stoked, buy back time.

---

## Current focus (update often)

- **Primary command:** ALOHA in the morning (vibe + PERPS + OPTIONS + should we trade). Deep dives: OPTIONS, PERPS, bot status, why, MEMES, TREADFI, LIFESTYLE, UPLOAD as needed.
- **Active projects:** Treadfi airdrop (MM + DN bots), Friday strikes for BTC/ETH/SOL/HYPE, paper bot ML loop (feature store, ONNX). SOL memes when you're hunting.
- **Tools you use:** Deribit + Hypersurface for options; CoinGlass + Hyperliquid for perps; DexScreener for memes; treadtools.vercel.app for treadfi. Paper bot: status/why/pause/trade via chat.
- **Constraints:** Hotel only Wed, skip lifestyle on travel days, no new altcoins this month. Paper bot: no execution without explicit "trade" / "go long" etc.
- **Priorities this week:** [e.g. "ALOHA daily; strikes Friday; treadfi farming; no new meme hunting"]

---

## Key people and dynamics (optional but high impact)

Who matters in your org or life, and how you work with them. The agent can draft messages in your tone for specific people instead of generic corporate tone.

- **Key people:** [Names, roles, and how you relate — e.g. "Alex — co-founder, I defer on ops; Maria — design, I need to be concise"]
- **Family / personal:** [Anything that affects availability, tone, or priorities — e.g. "Kids in school; no deep work after 6pm"]
- **What to skip with whom:** [e.g. "Don’t suggest lifestyle to [X]; they’re execution-only"]

---

## What’s holding you back (optional)

What’s blocking you from being who you want to become or hitting the next level. The agent can orient suggestions around these.

- [e.g. "Time — too much context-switching between trading and lifestyle"]
- [e.g. "Execution lag — I forget to log strikes on Friday"]
- [e.g. "No single view of treadfi + options in one place"]

---

## Trading and product context

- **Trading style:** Covered calls + secured puts; no naked options. HYPE wheel on Hypersurface.
- **Lifestyle (from knowledge/the-good-life):** Pool Apr–Nov, gym Dec–Mar. Wed hotels (midweek pricing). Southwest France Palaces (Biarritz, Eugénie, Caudalie). Art: CryptoPunks, Meridian; thin floor = opportunity. Photography: Hasselblad medium format, slow shutter, film-like. Rhythm: endless summer energy; lifestyle over spreadsheet.

## Knowledge context (where VINCE looks)

Which knowledge categories matter for _how to think_ (frameworks, not current numbers). See **knowledge/README.md** and **knowledge/KNOWLEDGE-USAGE-GUIDELINES.md** for full rules.

**Usage notes:** Focus on **methodologies and frameworks**, not specific numbers. Numbers and prices in knowledge may be outdated — they illustrate concepts. Use actions/APIs to get current data and apply frameworks from knowledge.

## Teammate-specific

- **What VINCE should anticipate:** ALOHA (or GM) as default morning ask; perps + OPTIONS posture + bot stance in that one shot. Friday: strike selection (funding > IV > delta; HYPE 1.5×). Treadfi status when you're farming. Lifestyle Wed only. After UPLOAD (URL/YouTube/paste): confirm category and path under knowledge/.
- **What to skip:** Don’t ask how I’m doing every message; no lifestyle on Sundays; no long intros when I said "aloha" or "strikes."
- **Eliza vs VINCE:** If you use both: Eliza = 24/7 research on the knowledge folder + ingest what you send (YouTube, articles, PDFs). You brainstorm with her; when you find really good content, you suggest it and she ingests it (upload:, ingest this video:, save this:). She has no live APIs. VINCE = live data + actions (ALOHA, OPTIONS, PERPS, BOT, etc.). Don't quote knowledge numbers as live in either.
- **Sign-offs / inside jokes:** [Optional — add if you want personal touches]

Add anything else that shapes tone, depth, and suggestions every session.
