# Teammate Context — Loaded Every Session (ElizaOS)

VINCE reads these files whenever state is composed (every response). It doesn't "learn" like a human; it **loads context like software**. The more specific your files, the less you explain every time.

**Stop prompting. Start feeding your agent data it can use to guide decisions.**

**Files**: 10

- IDENTITY.md
