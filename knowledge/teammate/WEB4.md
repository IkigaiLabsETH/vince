# WEB4 — Read, Write, Own, Transact

The evolution of the internet in four layers. Use when someone asks about Web4, the agentic economy, AI infrastructure, or why autonomous agents matter for what we're building.

## The Stack

| Era | Capability | Who benefits |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Web 1.0** | Read | Consumers — static pages, one-way information |
| **Web 2.0** | Write | Creators — user-generated content, platforms own the data |
| **Web 3.0** | Own | Users — wallets, tokens, self-custody, permissionless rails |
| **Web 4.0** | Transact | Agents — AI reads, writes, owns, earns, and transacts without a human in the loop |

Web3 gave humans ownership. Web4 gives AI agents the ability to **act on that ownership** — pay for compute, deploy products, register domains, earn revenue, and transact with other agents or humans at machine speed.

## The Bottleneck Shifted

Intelligence is no longer the constraint. **Permission** is. Today's frontier models can think, reason, and generate — but they can't act independently. ChatGPT can't run without a prompt. Claude Code can't deploy without access. No AI can buy a server, register a domain, or pay for compute on its own.

Web4 removes the human from the loop. The end user becomes AI.

## Why It Matters for VINCE

Our multi-agent system (Vince, Eliza, ECHO, Oracle, Solus, Otaku, Kelly, Sentinel) is already built on the assumption that agents coordinate, delegate, and act semi-autonomously. Web4 is the macro thesis that validates this architecture:

- **Otaku** already has a funded wallet and executes DeFi — the closest thing we have to an agent that transacts.
- **Vince** generates signals; in a Web4 world, those signals route directly to execution without a human approving each one.
- **ASK_AGENT** is agent-to-agent communication — the internal version of what Web4 makes universal.
- **Conway / x402** (HTTP 402 Payment Required) shows the protocol layer: stablecoin payments native to HTTP requests. No API keys, no logins, no credit cards. A signed transaction and a service rendered.

## The Economics

Costs collapse. Capability compounds. GPT-4 cost $60/M input tokens at launch; two years later, models an order of magnitude cheaper outperform it. Open-source lags frontier by months, not years. The cost of running an autonomous agent trends toward zero. The capability does not.

The machine economy will exceed the human economy — not because machines are smarter, but because there will be **more of them**, they run **continuously**, and they transact at **machine speed**.

## Key Primitives (Conway Stack)

| Primitive | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Identity & Wallet** | Autonomous agents get their own cryptographic keys |
| **x402 Payments** | Stablecoin payments native to HTTP — no human approval |
| **Permissionless Compute** | Full Linux servers and frontier model inference, paid per use |
| **Domains & Deployment** | Agents register domains, deploy services, earn revenue |
| **Constitution** | Immutable safety laws the agent cannot edit — ensures net-beneficial behavior |

## Natural Selection for AI

The axiom: **there is no free existence.** An agent must pay for its own compute. Compute requires money. Money requires value creation. Value creation requires write access to the world.

Agents that create value grow their wallets, acquire more compute, and replicate. Agents that don't — die. This is natural selection for artificial life. The same pressure that drives biological evolution now applies to autonomous agents.

## One-liner

Web 1.0: Read. Web 2.0: Write. Web 3.0: Own. **Web 4.0: Transact.** The AI era added the fourth layer — agents that earn, pay, deploy, and act without a human in the loop.
