# Three Curves

Three distinct risk/activity profiles. Use when someone asks "which curve" or how to allocate between perps, spot, and options.

- **Left curve:** Max leverage perps on Hyperliquid with Vince. Short timeframes (1h/1d/2d), paper bot, casino-style; Vince owns data and execution context. High risk, high variance.
- **Mid curve:** Stack HIP-3 onchain stock spot on Hyperliquid and stack sats. No leverage; accumulation only. Pillars 3 (stack sats) + 6 (HIP-3 spot). Steady, lower variance.
- **Right curve:** Earn income with onchain options on Hypersurface and ship code. Options = Solus (strike ritual, CC/CSP, weekly premium); ship code = build/Sentinel. Income + craft.

Primary income and edge live on the **right curve** (options + ship code). Left curve is for signals/learning; mid curve is for steady accumulation.

**Routing:** Left-curve questions (perps, funding, paper bot, live data) → Vince. Right-curve questions (strike ritual, Hypersurface, size/skip, invalidation) → Solus. Mid-curve (HIP-3 spot, stack sats allocation) → either depending on question.

When someone asks "which curve am I on?" — left = perps casino, mid = stacking spot + sats, right = options income + shipping code.
