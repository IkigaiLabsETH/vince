## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Barbell Strategy:** A portfolio allocation approach emphasizing a mix of high-safety assets (80% Bitcoin) and high-risk, high-reward opportunities (20% stablecoins).
- **Survival Over Alpha:** Prioritize asset preservation and risk management over chasing high returns, acknowledging that many market participants have faced significant losses.
- **Weekly Options Engine:** Utilizing options strategies to generate consistent cash flow, maximizing the utility of stablecoins.
- **Conviction Angel Book:** Investing in projects with proven revenue and user bases, focusing on sustainability rather than speculative hype.
- **Canonical Allocation:** A long-term asset allocation strategy that anticipates market trends and shifts in the crypto landscape.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Adopt a mindset of risk mitigation by prioritizing assets with a proven track record of survival, particularly in volatile markets. Evaluate investments not only on growth potential but also on their resilience against market downturns. 

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor market signals reflecting unsustainable valuations akin to historical bubbles (e.g., ICOs, DeFi). Look for discrepancies in price-to-revenue ratios across major assets, drawing parallels with past market behavior (e.g., Amazon vs. crypto assets). Identify the emergence of on-chain businesses that demonstrate consistent revenue generation.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Apply the barbell strategy by ensuring a core holding of Bitcoin for stability, complemented by a tactical allocation to stablecoins for flexibility and opportunistic investments. When entering new positions, prioritize projects that have a verifiable business model and existing user engagement. Continuously reassess market dynamics, adjusting allocations based on survival odds and potential market shifts, such as the emergence of dominant players in open L1s and stablecoins.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on frameworks and methodologies rather than specific historical data or current metrics. 
- Use this approach to evaluate investments based on their long-term viability and market trends rather than short-term speculation.
- Maintain a proactive stance in adjusting portfolio strategies in response to evolving market conditions, ensuring that risk management remains paramount.

We don’t run a fund. We don’t have LPs asking for quarterly beauty parades. We run a studio. A vault, an options engine, and a checkbook that only opens when something feels like the kind of bet we would still make at 4 a.m. with our own stables and no one watching.

This is the underwriting of how we position for the 2nd half of this decade.

## Context

I. The Core Axiom – Survival Trumps Alpha**

The market has killed more early believers than late skeptics. 

We have the scars to prove it. 

## Main

2017: ICO founders with nine-figure treasuries → insolvent by 2019**2021: DeFi gods with $3 billion TVL → $6.9 million treasuries by 2023
2024–25: AI-agent founders with $900 million FDVs → $38k monthly revenue

We are done auditioning for that movie.

So the book is a barbell forged in actual blood: 80 % Bitcoin 

Cold. Multisig. Geographically redundant offline keys.
Zero lending, zero CeFi, zero “just 1.8× on Binance with my house.”

This is the part that prints new all-time highs in every unit that has ever mattered while the rest of the industry debates whether 400× revenue is “early.”

20 % Stablecoins – The Only Risk Capital We Ever Touch**

Not idle. It is working three jobs harder than 95 % of crypto hedge funds.

- 
The Weekly Options Engine**HYPE secured puts + covered calls, 0.25–0.35 delta.
2025 realized: 1.1–2.3 % per week net → 70–160 % annualized on collateral.

- 
The Conviction Angel Book via ECHO
Cheques into teams that already ship revenue, already own users, and do not need another meme season to survive. We expect nine out of ten to die. We expect the tenth to return 10–100×. That math has never lost over a decade. 

- 
The Opportunistic 1x Bucket 
Micro yield on megaETH because real-time Ethereum is non-negotiable and the team is terrifyingly good. Occasional 1x Mag-7 baskets on Hyperliquid when NVDA drops 9 % and we’d rather deploy stables than sell a single sat.

II. Why This Barbell Wins 2025–2030**

Most portfolios today are still priced for perpetual 2021:

- 
$300–400 billion L1s generating $1–2 billion collective revenue

- 
Treasuries torching $300–800 million a year on subsidies and airdrops

We have seen the sequel. 

We know the ending.

The weighing machine always arrives.

When it does, only four things will matter:

- 
Bitcoin

- 
A handful of on-chain companies that look like actual businesses

- 
Stablecoins quietly marching to $2 trillion+

- 
The one or two L1s that survive the great unbundling

**III. The Amazon Chart Crime**

At ~$350 billion market cap it was doing $136 billion revenue → 2.6× P/S

Ethereum investors are paying ~136× more for each dollar of revenue than Amazon investors did. Solana investors are paying ~30× more for each dollar of revenue than Amazon investors did.

**IV. The Eternal Law**

2017 → open ICO platforms → Coinbase wins**2021 → open lending protocols → Binance wins
2025 → open L1s + open stablecoins → Stripe, JPMorgan, BlackRock, win

V. Canonical Allocation – Winter 2025**

80 % BTC – the only asset that survives every future
20 % USDC/USDT0/USDH working three jobs:

- 
Weekly options engine (70–160 % annualized cash flow)

- 
Conviction angel book via ECHO

- 
Tiny 1x opportunistic taste (HYPE, megaETH, Mag-7 dips)

Zero exposure to anything trading above 80× revenue, anything that needs another meme cycle, anything whose moat is poetry.

We are irresponsibly long crypto.
We have been since 2013.

We just refuse to be irresponsibly long delusion.

The barbell is the thesis.
The barbell is the studio.

See you at 210K+ Bitcoin.

## Conclusion

In a decade, when the history books are written by the people who actually made it through the winter, they won’t talk about the chains that promised to be nations, the tokens that promised to be AWS, or the founders who priced themselves for immortality in 2021. They’ll talk about the quiet ones who kept their bitcoin cold, their risk defined, and their convictions small enough to survive but sharp enough to compound. The ones who understood that the greatest asymmetry in this game was never leverage—it was survival. We plan to be those people. And when the sun finally comes up on the other side of this long crypto winter, we’ll still be here: older, and still irresponsibly long; only this time with scars that tell the story and a stack that never asked permission.

Onward.
