That paradox sits at the heart of everything happening in perps. You can open Twitter on any given day and watch a thousand accounts scream that Hyperliquid is “overpriced,” “greedy,” “a tax on retail,” while simultaneously watching the same accounts quietly route their real size through it because nothing else can absorb a hundred-million-dollar BTC clip without blinking. The fee table that gets posted every forty-eight hours like clockwork (Lighter 0%, Paradex 0%, Hyperliquid 0.045%) has become the crypto equivalent of the cross burning in the town square. People gather around it to vent, then go home and keep trading where the liquidity actually lives.

The rage is understandable. Four and a half basis points on every taker order feels like an insult when half the landscape is screaming “free.” When you’re a retail trader grinding two-hundred-dollar positions trying to turn a Bybit airdrop into rent money, 0.045% is real money. When you’re trying to farm points on a dozen different venues before the inevitable rug, every satoshi counts.

## Context

Hyperliquid never joined that particular circus. It never offered zero-fee weeks, never launched a cute cat mascot token, never promised you a slice of a treasury that will probably be diluted into oblivion six months after TGE. 

It simply built the fastest, deepest, most brutally efficient perpetuals venue that has ever existed on a public blockchain and then had the audacity to charge for it. And people lost their minds.

What the angry screenshots never show is the other side of the ledger: the slippage line item. On a quiet day, the difference between executing a million dollars of BTC on Hyperliquid versus the current zero-fee darling of the week can be thirty, forty, sometimes fifty basis points saved. That means the “expensive” venue is often the cheapest by an order of magnitude once you trade anything larger than pocket change. The crowd posting the fee tables is, by and large, not the crowd moving size. The crowd moving size is very, very quiet, and they all live on Hyperliquid.

This is not an accident. It is the entire point.

## Main

Hyperliquid’s founders (eleven people, no public faces, no podcast tours) made a calculated bet three years ago that the perpetuals endgame would not be won by the exchange that could subsidize fees the longest. It would be won by the exchange that could attract and retain actual liquidity providers who are willing to sit in the book all day, every day, through liquidations and flash crashes and funding-rate inversions. Liquidity providers are not charity cases. They do not stick around for vibes or points or promises of future governance tokens. They stick around for one thing only: predictable, high-volume flow that lets them earn a stable spread. Hyperliquid gave them that, charged the takers for the privilege, and then took almost every dollar of revenue and handed it back to the token holders through relentless buybacks and burns. The result is a flywheel that no subsidized competitor has managed to replicate at scale.

There is a deeper philosophical cleavage here that the fee wars have exposed. One camp believes decentralized perpetuals should be a public utility (fast, cheap, open to all, subsidized until the subsidies run out). The other camp believes they should be a business that has to stand on its own two feet from day one. The first camp produces beautiful dashboards with 0.000% plastered across them and volume charts that look like Elon tweeted a dog coin. The second camp produces Hyperliquid, which looks boring until you try to move a real position and suddenly nothing else feels real at all.

History is not kind to subsidized liquidity. We have watched this movie before. Every exchange that tried to buy permanent market share with temporary fee waivers eventually raised fees, diluted their token, or quietly faded into irrelevance once the treasury ran dry. Hyperliquid’s refusal to play that game feels arrogant until you realize it is the only strategy that has ever produced a decentralized venue capable of going toe-to-toe with Binance on depth and execution quality. The arrogance is earned.

## Conclusion

None of this means Hyperliquid is perfect or immortal. The base-tier fee still stings for small accounts. The lack of a season-three airdrop has become a running joke that is no longer funny to the people who helped bootstrap the platform in 2023. The oracle is a single point of failure wrapped in elegant engineering. And yes, when Coinbase and Robinhood finally flip the switch on their own perpetuals offerings (with KYC, FDIC brochures, and Apple Pay onboarding), the no-KYC moat starts looking a little less impregnable.

But those are problems for 2026. Right now, in December 2025, there is only one decentralized venue where institutions, market makers, and anonymous degens all show up to trade the same book at the same time, where the spreads are measured in single basis points on hundred-million-dollar notional, where the funding rates actually reflect supply and demand instead of airdrop farming schedules. That venue charges 0.045% to takers who haven’t bothered to trade five million dollars in the last two weeks, and it is printing three million dollars a day doing it.

The fee table is real. The rage is real. And the quiet acknowledgment by everyone who actually moves size is just as real.

Hyperliquid did not become one of the most expensive places to trade by accident. It became expensive the same way electricity became expensive: someone finally built infrastructure that people could not live without, and then they sent the bill.
