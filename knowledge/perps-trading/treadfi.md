## Core Concepts

### What Tread.fi Actually Is

**Tread.fi is an algorithmic trading terminal and Order Execution Management System (OEMS)** — NOT a simple trading bot. It provides institutional-grade execution across multiple CEX and DEX venues.

Two main bot types:
1. **Market Maker Bot** — Automated market making via TWAP with passive limit orders
2. **Delta Neutral Bot** — Simultaneous long/short positions for funding rate capture

### Key Distinction

| What It Is | What It Is NOT |
|------------|----------------|
| Liquidity provision tool | Price prediction bot |
| Spread capture mechanism | Directional trading system |
| Points farming vehicle | Set-and-forget passive income |
| TWAP execution engine | Taker/market order bot |

### Fee Structure

**Tread Builder Fee:**
| Exchange | Builder Fee |
|----------|-------------|
| Hyperliquid | 2 bps (0.02%) |
| Extended | 2 bps (0.02%) |
| Pacifica | 2 bps (0.02%) |
| Paradex | Check current |
| Nado | Check current |

**Exchange Maker Fees:**
| Exchange | Maker Fee | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Hyperliquid** | Low | VIP tiers available |

## Market Maker Bot

### How It Works

The Market Maker Bot:
1. **Simultaneously places buy and sell limit orders** around current market price
2. **Uses TWAP strategy** for optimal execution timing
3. **Splits notional 50/50** between buy and sell sides
4. **Only uses maker/limit orders** — never crosses spread or uses taker orders
5. **Refreshes orders periodically** to stay close to market price
6. **Auto-pauses** when exposure in one direction grows too large

### Quick Start Setup

**Step 1: Select Exchange & Pair**
- Start with highly liquid perpetual pairs (BTC-PERP, ETH-PERP)
- For spot: Must hold 50% base token, 50% quote token

**Step 2: Input Margin**
- Margin × Leverage = Target Volume
- Higher leverage = more volume but higher liquidation risk

**Step 3: Select Mode**
- Start with **Normal** mode
- Keep default settings for first trade

**Step 4: Review Pre-Trade Analytics**
- Verify margin < available margin
- Check estimated fees and max loss
- Max Loss = Stop Loss % × Margin

### Supported Assets

| Type | Supported | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Perpetuals | ✅ Yes | Primary use case |
| Spot | ✅ Yes | Requires 50/50 split of base/quote |
| Futures Contracts | ❌ No | Not supported |
| Options | ❌ No | Separate beta feature |

---

## Delta Neutral Bot

### Overview

Opens simultaneous long and short positions to:
- **Capture funding rate differentials**
- **Neutralize directional price risk**
- **Farm multiple protocol points simultaneously**

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: Select accounts/pairs for long and short legs
2. **Execution**: TWAP strategy minimizes market impact on both legs
3. **Funding Capture**: Earn/pay based on net funding rate difference
4. **Wind Down**: Use "Wind Down" action to close both positions

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Total Exposure** | Sum of both legs' executed notional |
| **Net Exposure** | Directional imbalance (should be ~0%) |
| **Net Sided Funding Rate** | Long FR + Short FR = your net income/cost |
| **Unbalanced Warning** | Triggers when net exposure > 1% |

### Delta Neutral Configuration

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Long Leg** | Choose DEX with positive funding or early points program |
| **Short Leg** | Choose DEX with 2x Tread boost (e.g., Hyperliquid) |
| **Pair** | Same asset both sides for true delta neutral |
| **Notional** | Split 50/50 automatically |
| **Duration** | Based on 50% POV of slower leg, max 1 day |

### Execution Modes (Delta Neutral)

| Mode | Duration | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | ~5 min | Fast entry, higher impact |
| **Normal** | ~15 min | Balanced approach |
| **Passive** | ~30 min | Minimize impact, slower fills |

### Multi-Airdrop Farming Strategy

Run delta-neutral to simultaneously farm:
1. **TreadFi points** (100k weekly pool)
2. **Long DEX points** (e.g., Nado pre-announcement, Paradex, Pacifica)
3. **Short DEX points** (e.g., Hyperliquid 2x boost, Extended 2x boost)

**Recommended DEX Combinations (Connected Exchanges):**

| Long Side | Short Side | Rationale | Priority |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Nado** | **Hyperliquid** | Pre-announcement + 2x boost | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Nado** | **Extended** | Pre-announcement + 2x boost | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Paradex** | **Hyperliquid** | Zero fees + 2x boost | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Pacifica** | **Hyperliquid** | Early + established | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Paradex** | **Extended** | Zero fees + TradFi | ⭐⭐⭐ |

> **Current Meta:** Long Nado + Short Hyperliquid is the optimal setup. You're farming an unannounced points program (Nado) while capturing 2x Tread boost on the hedge (Hyperliquid).

---

## Reference Price Modes

### Mid Price Mode (Default)

**How it works:** Orders placed based on current order book mid-price. Orders float with market.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Best For** | General MM, volume generation, points farming |
| **Pros** | High fill probability, follows market trend |
| **Cons** | No guaranteed profit per trade (can buy high, sell low) |

**Spread Settings (Mid Price):**
- **Lower (0-2 bps)**: Prioritizes speed, capture rebates
- **Higher (+10-50 bps)**: Prioritizes margin, fewer fills

### Grid Mode (Advanced)

**How it works:** Uses last executed price as anchor. Rule: "Don't buy higher than I sold, don't sell lower than I bought."

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Best For** | Range-bound/sideways markets |
| **Pros** | Guarantees $0 or positive PnL on spread |
| **Cons** | Can stall if price trends strongly |
| **Hard Stop** | ±0.5% from last fill — order may cancel |

**Spread Settings (Grid):**

| Spread | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **-10 to -1 bps** | Price concession to unstick stalled positions |
| **0 bps** | Break-even on spread (still pay fees) |
| **+1 to +50 bps** | Lock in profit, but risk stalling |

### Reverse Grid Mode

**How it works:** Uses average of both executed prices as anchor. Profits during trending movements.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Best For** | Trending markets |
| **Pros** | Auto locks profits when trends continue |
| **Cons** | Can stall in sideways or reversing markets |
| **Safety** | Has both stop loss AND take profit |

### Blend Mode

**How it works:** Averages your exchange's mid-price with a reference price from a more liquid market.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Best For** | Trading on less liquid exchanges |
| **Use Case** | Anticipate price convergence to larger market |

## Advanced Settings Deep Dive

### Participation Rate

Controls execution speed relative to 24h trading volume.

| Mode | Speed | Rate Multiplier | Duration | Use Case |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | Fastest | 0.10 | Shortest | Fast markets, quick entry/exit |
| **Normal** | Moderate | 0.025 | 4× Aggressive | General purpose |
| **Passive** | Slowest | 0.01 | 10× Aggressive | Low-liquidity, minimize impact |

**Notes:**
- Minimum duration: 10 minutes (enforced)
- Aggressive = higher impact, may worsen fills
- Passive = longer exposure to directional moves

### Directional Bias

Influence timing/distribution of buy vs sell orders.

| Bias | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Long (+)** | Front-loads buys, back-loads sells |
| **Short (-)** | Front-loads sells, back-loads buys |
| **Neutral (0)** | Equal timing distribution |

**Technical Notes:**
- Maps linearly to alpha tilt (±1 → ±0.2)
- Extreme bias (±1) requires 20% additional margin

### Stop Loss

Monitors PnL in real-time, cancels all orders and closes positions when threshold hit.

**Formula:** `Max Loss = Stop Loss % × Margin`

| Stop Loss | Risk Level | Use Case |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| 5% | Conservative | High leverage, volatile assets |
| 10% | Moderate | Standard trading |
| 25% | Patient | Range-bound strategies |
| 100% | Maximum | Willing to lose entire margin |

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Stop loss may not prevent liquidation at >20x leverage during extreme moves. Exchange can liquidate before stop triggers.

### Grid Reset Threshold (Soft Reset)

Circuit breaker before stop loss — gives position chance to rebalance naturally.

**How it works:**
1. When price drifts from last fill by configured %, bot triggers soft reset
2. "Behind" leg switches from grid pricing to mid-market pricing
3. Helps unfilled leg execute and rebalance exposure
4. Returns to grid mode once balanced

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Lower %** | More conservative, triggers earlier, sacrifices some profit |
| **Higher %** | More patient, allows deeper unrealized loss |
| **Off** | For choppy, mean-reverting markets |
| **25-50%** | Moderate trending markets |
| **75%** | Volatile markets, last resort |

---

### Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Opportunities

When price diverges between exchanges:

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Paradex < Hyperliquid | Long Paradex, Short Hyperliquid |
| Extended lags on TradFi | Use Blend mode to capture |
| Nado vs Hyperliquid spread | Delta neutral both sides |
| New listing on Paradex | Premium capture opportunity |

**Blend Mode Use Cases:**

1. **Pacifica → Hyperliquid**: Reference HL's deeper book
2. **Extended TradFi → TradFi CEX**: Converge to spot prices
3. **Any low-liquidity venue**: Reference most liquid market

---

## Recommended Strategies

### Strategy 1: Highly Liquid Majors (Fast Price Action)

**Best for:** BTC-PERP, ETH-PERP during active sessions

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Reference Price | **Grid Mode** |
| Spread | **-1 bps** |
| Participation | **Aggressive** |
| Stop Loss | 5-10% |

**When to Run:**
- ✅ NY Session (Mon-Fri 9:30am-4pm ET) mid-session
- ✅ Choppy, non-trending environments

**When to AVOID:**
- ❌ US Market Open (9:30am ET)
- ❌ NY Close (4pm ET)
- ❌ Major macro events (Fed, CPI)

**Why -1 bps Works:**
- Acts as "insurance" — tiny concession improves fill probability
- Prevents stalling that leads to 50 bps hard stop-loss
- Results cluster tightly around -1 to +1 bps
- High turnover compensates for smaller margin

### Strategy 2: Range-Bound / Low-OI Assets

**Best for:** Sideways markets with clear support/resistance

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Reference Price | **Grid Mode** |
| Spread | **+5 bps** |
| Participation | **Normal or Passive** |
| Stop Loss | 10-25% |

**Rationale:**
- Grid mode excels in clean ranges
- Wider spreads capture more per loop without price running away

### Strategy 3: Points Farming (Ventuals/Low Liquidity)

**Best for:** Maker points programs on low-liquidity venues

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Reference Price | **Mid Price Mode** |
| Spread | **+10 bps or higher** |
| Participation | **Passive** |
| Stop Loss | 25% |

**Points Scoring Factors:**
- **Size**: Total volume of maker orders
- **Distance**: Orders within "reasonable range" of mid
- **Uptime**: Continuous presence in order book
- **Two-Sidedness**: Activity on both bid and ask
- **Fill Quality**: Competitive price execution

**Optimization:**
- +10 bps keeps orders in book longer (better uptime)
- Not so close that you fill too fast
- Maintains balanced book both sides

### Strategy 4: Delta Neutral Multi-Farm

**Best for:** Farming multiple airdrops with hedged exposure

| Setting | Long Leg | Short Leg |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Exchange | Early-stage DEX | Hyperliquid |
| Pair | BTC-PERP | BTC-PERP |
| Leverage | 20-40x | 20-40x |
| Duration | 15-30 min | 15-30 min |

**Always:**
- Set TP/SL directly on each DEX
- Monitor net exposure (should be ~0%)
- Check funding rates before entry

---

## Points Program

### Season 1 Overview

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Weekly Pool** | 100,000 points |
| **Distribution** | Proportional to adjusted volume |
| **Week Reset** | Wednesday 00:00 UTC |
| **Season End** | May 18, 2026 |
| **Min Eligibility** | $100,000 adjusted volume per week |

### Points Formula

```
Your Points = 100,000 × (Your Adjusted Volume / Total Adjusted Volume)
```

### Volume Buff Multipliers

| Weekly Volume | Multiplier |
|---------------|------------|
| < $1M | 1.0x |
| ≥ $1M | 1.1x |
| ≥ $5M | 1.2x |
| ≥ $10M | 1.3x |

### Exchange Multipliers

| Exchange | Boost | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Hyperliquid** | 2x | Confirmed |
| **Extended** | 2x | Confirmed |
| **Paradex** | Variable | Check points page |
| **Nado** | Variable | Pre-announcement (early!) |
| **Pacifica** | Variable | Check points page |

### Referral Program

- **20%** of referred users' weekly volume added to your activity
- Referred user must trade ≥$100k/week before you earn

### Boosted Campaigns

Watch for time-limited campaigns:
- 5x points for first $100M volume on new integrations
- Special events and voting rewards
- Community share from exchange integration fees

### Point Valuation Estimate

Per community estimates (not financial advice):
- **~$4+ per point** at modest FDV
- Getting harder to farm as competition increases
- Early adopters have significant advantage

---

## Risk Management

### Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS configure stop loss in TreadFi** — options: 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%
2. **At >20x leverage, also set TP/SL on DEX** — exchange can liquidate before TreadFi stop triggers
3. **Stop loss may not save you** during extreme volatility gaps
4. **Monitor positions actively** — not a passive income strategy

### Liquidation Prevention

| Risk Factor | Mitigation |
|-------------|------------|
| High leverage | Use 10-20x max, especially when learning |
| One-sided exposure | Watch for "Paused" status, let bot rebalance |
| No stop loss on DEX | ALWAYS set external TP/SL |
| Overnight positions | Close or set wide stops before sleep |

### When Bot Pauses

**This is a safety feature, not an error.**

The bot auto-pauses when:
- Exposure in one direction grows too large
- It will resume when exposure naturally rebalances

Do NOT:
- Panic cancel
- Force close at bad prices

DO:
- Wait for rebalance
- Monitor the situation
- Only intervene if truly stuck

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Insufficient Margin** | Collateral too low | Add funds or reduce notional |
| **Bot Paused** | One-sided exposure | Wait for rebalance (safety feature) |
| **Order Stalling** | Grid mode in trending market | Switch to Mid Price or use -1 bps spread |
| **No Fills** | Spread too wide | Reduce spread, try Aggressive mode |
| **Order Not Submitting** | API key issues | Check permissions, balance, margin mode |

### Spot Trading Issues

- Must hold **50% base, 50% quote** token
- Funds must be in **Spot Account**, not Perps account
- Leverage not available for spot

### Residual Positions

- Orders paused/resumed may have unfilled residuals
- Cancelled MM orders auto-place closing order for zero balance

---

## Quick Reference

### Optimal Settings by Scenario

| Scenario | Mode | Spread | Participation | Stop Loss |
|----------|------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| BTC/ETH fast markets | Grid | -1 bps | Aggressive | 5-10% |
| Range-bound altcoins | Grid | +5 bps | Normal | 10-25% |
| Points farming | Mid Price | +10 bps | Passive | 25% |
| Delta neutral | Mid Price | 0 bps | Normal | 10% |
| Trending market | Reverse Grid | +2 bps | Normal | 10% |

### Trading Session Timing

| Session | Time (ET) | Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| NY Open | 9:30am | ❌ Avoid |
| NY Mid-Session | 10am-3pm | ✅ Best time |
| NY Close | 4pm | ❌ Avoid |

## Summary

**Tread.fi is a sophisticated market making and delta neutral execution platform, not a simple trading bot.**

### Connected Exchanges Summary

| Exchange | Best For | Tread Boost |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Hyperliquid** | Short leg DN, high-freq MM | 2x |
| **Paradex** | Zero-fee MM, pre-markets | Variable |
| **Extended** | TradFi assets, 2x farming | 2x |
| **Nado** | Long leg DN (early!), unified margin | Pre-announce |
| **Pacifica** | Early farming, AI tools | Variable |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Understand the mechanics** before scaling up
2. **Grid -1 bps** is statistically safer for active markets
3. **Configure stop loss in TreadFi** — at >20x leverage, also set TP/SL on DEX as backup
4. **Points farming requires $100k+ weekly** adjusted volume
5. **Delta neutral** lets you farm multiple airdrops simultaneously
6. **Prioritize 2x boosted exchanges** (Hyperliquid, Extended) for short leg
7. **Farm early-stage DEXs** (Nado) on the long leg
8. **Use Paradex for zero-fee** pure spread capture
9. **Monitor actively** — this is not passive income
10. **Season 1 ends May 18, 2026** — still time to accumulate

### Optimal Delta Neutral Setup (Current Meta)

```
Long Leg:  Nado (pre-announcement, early points)
Short Leg: Hyperliquid (2x boost, deep liquidity)
Pair:      BTC-PERP or ETH-PERP
Duration:  15-30 min TWAP
```

> "Tread alone will end up as a more lucrative play than all Perp DEXs farmed on it"
