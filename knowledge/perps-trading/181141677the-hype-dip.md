## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Fear & Greed Index:** A sentiment analysis tool indicating market psychology, with extremes suggesting potential reversals.
- **Supply Pressure:** Understanding token unlock schedules and their impact on market dynamics.
- **Buyback Mechanism:** The strategic use of protocol revenue for token buybacks to create supply scarcity.
- **Market Share Dynamics:** Analyzing competitive positioning amongst perpetual markets, especially in the face of zero-fee competitors.

**Analytical Approach:**
- **Thesis Re-Underwriting:** Regularly reassess your investment thesis by analyzing both bullish and bearish narratives. This involves scrutinizing market sentiment, supply dynamics, and competitive landscape to maintain a balanced perspective.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Use macroeconomic indicators and specific market metrics (like Bitcoin dominance) to contextualize your asset’s performance. This helps in identifying broader trends that could affect your trading strategy.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Monitor shifts in market sentiment as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index. Look for signs of accumulation during extreme fear, which historically precedes price recoveries.
- **Supply Dynamics:** Identify unlock events and their potential impact on token supply. Recognize that large unlocks can lead to price pressure, while effective buyback strategies can counteract this pressure over time.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Scenario Planning:** Construct multiple scenarios (bullish and bearish) based on market data and sentiment analysis. Use these scenarios to inform trading decisions, particularly when engaging in options trading.
- **Risk Management:** Incorporate mechanisms to hedge against bearish scenarios, such as utilizing options or diversifying holdings to mitigate risk from supply shocks or competitive threats.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

The price of HYPE sits at twenty-eight dollars as I write this, down more than fifty percent from its September all-time high, down twenty-five percent in the past month alone, down eight percent in the last twenty-four hours, and the timeline is screaming. Unlocks, team dumps, Lighter eating share, zero-fee competitors, dilution forever, dead cat, rug, pick your poison. 

The Fear & Greed Index is at thirteen, which is the kind of extreme fear that usually only shows up right before violent reversals. I have seen this movie before. We all have. And every single time the script is the same: weak hands puke, strong hands accumulate, the protocol keeps printing money, and twelve months later everyone wonders why they ever doubted it.

## Context

So let’s do the adult thing. Let’s re-underwrite the entire thesis, in public, with fresh eyes, and then explain exactly why we are expressing that conviction through weekly options on Hypersurface instead of just closing our eyes and diamond-handing the spot bag.

First, the bear case, because it deserves to be heard. November 29 unlocked almost ten million tokens, roughly three hundred million dollars at the time, and another ten million hit wallets every month for the next two years. That is real supply pressure. Some of those tokens have been sold, both OTC and on-chain, and the headlines wrote themselves. Market share in perpetuals has slipped from a high of seventy percent to the low twenties on certain days as zero-fee venues like Lighter and Aster vacuum up retail flow. 

## Main

Bitcoin dominance is pushing fifty-nine percent, alts are bleeding, and the broader macro backdrop looks shaky. If you wanted to construct a bearish narrative, you have plenty of bricks.

Now zoom out.
> 
Hyperliquid is still generating 2.7 million dollars in protocol revenue every single day, thirty-day average, with spikes above three million on busy days. That annualizes to over one billion dollars, more than most Layer-1s make in fees combined. 97 percent of those fees are used to buy back HYPE on the open market and send it to the Assistance Fund. In November alone the protocol bought back 1.89 million tokens, 66.9 million dollars worth at an average price of 35 dollars. Do the math: at current prices the buyback engine could retire the entire circulating supply in roughly 1.5 to 3 years, depending on volume. Supply shock is not a meme, it is a line item on the dashboard.

Open interest sits at 6.6 billion dollars, more than every other perpetual DEX on earth combined. Daily volume regularly clears 60 billion, sometimes 80 billion. The platform has 1.3 million cumulative users and almost 300K monthly actives, numbers that dwarf every other decentralized exchange in existence. 
> 
HIP-3, the permissionless market deployment upgrade that went live in October, is already doing 400 million dollars of volume a day across builder-created assets. That is not retail gambling on dog coins, that is institutions and sophisticated traders using Hyperliquid to trade synthetic Nasdaq, Nvidia, S&P, gold, whatever they want, twenty-four hours a day, with CEX-grade execution and no KYC.

[The SWPE ratio, the closest thing crypto has to a real price-to-earnings multiple, is currently 1.7, the lowest in the project’s history.](https://www.skewga.com/hyperliquid/multiple_revenue) (**10–80x lower than peers)

Every previous time it dipped below three, the token went on to rally two to three hundred percent within quarters. The team remains tiny, twelve people, and they are actively hiring engineers to ship faster. Wallet integrations with MetaMask, Phantom, and Rabby are live and exclusive, giving Hyperliquid a distribution moat no competitor can replicate overnight. And perhaps most importantly, sophisticated traders do not switch platforms for a few basis points of fee savings, they switch for execution quality, depth, and uptime. Hyperliquid wins on every single one of those metrics.

In other words, nothing fundamental has broken. The story is actually getting stronger while the price is getting cheaper. This is the exact environment where patient capital makes its money.

Now comes the part most people still don’t fully appreciate, the reason we are not just buying spot and praying, but actively running the wheel with cash-secured puts and covered calls on Hypersurface.

We believe HYPE is going to fifty dollars, then eighty dollars, then one hundred dollars plus over the next twelve to twenty-four months. That is the base case. But belief is cheap, execution is expensive. The wheel lets us get paid, in cash, every single week, for being right on the long-term direction while dramatically reducing the emotional and financial cost of being wrong on the timing.

Here’s how it feels in practice. When the market sentiment is this ugly, implied volatility explodes and premiums are fat. Our average cost is $33 / HYPE.

We just added a cash-secured put at the $25 strike for the 12/12 expiry. If the put expires worthless, we pocket upfront premium and do it again next week. If we get assigned, we buy the tokens at an effective cost basis of twenty-five dollars, lowering our average entry and giving us even more shares to sell calls against. When price recovers, and we believe it will, we flip the position into covered calls. Our 34 dollar call for the same expiry is currently paying about 92 percent annualized. If it expires we keep the shares and the premium. If we get called away we sell at 34 dollars, booking a small gain plus all the theta we collected along the way, then immediately sell another put and restart the loop.

The beauty is that both outcomes are good. We are never hoping for a moonshot to make money, we are simply renting our capital, and our conviction, to the market at prices we already decided we love. The wheel turns volatility into yield, turns drawdowns into cheaper cost basis, and turns rallies into clean exits, all without leverage, without liquidation risk, and without having to stare at the chart every five minutes.

Compare that to being a traditional liquidity provider in an AMM pool. You fight impermanent loss, you rebalance constantly, you pray price stays in your range, and if it runs away you stop earning entirely. On Hypersurface you pick your exit price once, collect the entire premium upfront, and go live your life. 

That is why, even with the price down and the timeline loud, our position has not changed. We are long the protocol, long the flywheel, long the team, and long the token. We are simply choosing to express that view in the most capital-efficient, emotionally stable way possible, collecting upfront premium each week in cold hard USDT0 while the market figures out what it already owns.

The dip is the setup. The wheel is the edge. The fundamentals are the anchor.

## Conclusion

We keep spinning, we keep collecting, and we will still be here when the rest of the market finally remembers why they were excited in the first place.

See you at a hundred dollars.
