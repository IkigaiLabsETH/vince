Perpetual futures DEXs (Perp DEXs) have become one of the most efficient and relatively low-risk ways to farm airdrops, especially for traders with limited capital. Many early participants in platforms like Lighter and Hyperliquid received solid airdrops simply by generating trading volume and holding positions in the early days of their points programs.

The appeal is clear: the process is straightforward, the mechanics reward consistent activity, and — when done correctly — the directional risk can be almost entirely eliminated. The core idea is to generate trading volume and open interest to earn points while keeping positions delta-neutral (immune to price movements) and, when possible, earning funding rate payments along the way.

This essay explains the two main low-risk strategies — delta-neutral trading and funding rate farming — and highlights four Perp DEXs that, as of early 2026, are actively running points campaigns suitable for these approaches.

Strategy 1: Delta-Neutral Trading (Minimal Directional Risk)

Delta-neutral trading is the foundation of safe Perp DEX farming. Despite the technical-sounding name, the concept is simple: you open offsetting positions across different exchanges so that price movements in the underlying asset cancel each other out.How to set it up

Choose a liquid perpetual pair (e.g., BTC-PERP, ETH-PERP, or SOL-PERP).

Open a long position of size X on Exchange A.

Open a short position of the exact same size X on Exchange B.

Hold both positions open.

Why it works for farming

Your net exposure to price movement is close to zero.

Both exchanges register trading volume and open interest from your positions.

You qualify for points/airdrops on both platforms simultaneously.

Your capital remains largely intact (minus small funding rate fluctuations or occasional rebalancing costs).

The only real costs are potential differences in funding rates between the two legs and minor slippage when adjusting positions. By using low or no leverage (1x–2x), liquidation risk is virtually eliminated.

Strategy 2: Funding Rate Farming (Get Paid to Farm)

Most Perp DEXs use funding rates to anchor perpetual contract prices to the spot price. When the perp price deviates from spot:

If perp > spot → longs pay shorts

If perp < spot → shorts pay longs

These payments happen every 1–8 hours depending on the platform. Savvy farmers can structure delta-neutral positions to collect funding payments on both sides.

How to set it up

Identify two DEXs trading the same pair where funding rates are on opposite sides (one positive for longs, one positive for shorts).

On the DEX where longs are paid → open a long.

On the DEX where shorts are paid → open a short.

Match the notional sizes exactly.

Outcome

You remain delta-neutral (price movement neutralized).

You collect funding payments from both positions.

You continue earning points/volume credits on both platforms.

This strategy turns farming from a cost center into a small yield-generating activity while you wait for the airdrop.

Final Tips for Sustainable Farming

Perp DEX airdrop farming is remarkably simple, but consistency and discipline separate profitable farmers from those who lose money.

Always maintain delta neutrality — monitor and rebalance positions regularly.

Use minimal leverage (ideally 1x–2x) to eliminate liquidation risk.

Prioritize funding rate positive sides when possible, but never sacrifice neutrality for extra yield.

Limit yourself to 3–4 platforms to keep management manageable.

Track points balances and program rules weekly — terms can change.

Remember that even “risk-free” strategies carry basis risk (slight price divergences between exchanges), smart contract risk, and potential changes to points formulas.

When executed with patience and proper risk management, Perp DEX farming remains one of the highest expected-value activities in crypto for retail-sized capital. The combination of near-zero directional exposure, potential funding income, and substantial airdrop upside makes it uniquely attractive.

Keep positions balanced, stay consistent, and let volume compound into points. The next big airdrop is likely already among the platforms being farmed today.

Airdrops aren’t dead—they’re just evolving. The easy money from passive liquidity provision is largely gone, but 2026 is shaping up to be another banner year for farmers who are willing to put in thoughtful, active work. Prediction markets and perpetual DEXs remain two of the highest-conviction sectors precisely because they demand real engagement: managing positions, hunting inefficiencies, and staying consistent over months.

That friction is exactly what keeps participation lower and rewards higher compared to “deposit and forget” protocols. Many have confirmed generous community allocations (20–50% of supply), clear paths to TGE in 2026, and mechanics that reward genuine usage over sybil farming. Extended stands out as my highest-conviction play due to its explosive growth, vault yields, and confirmed 30% airdrop, but the broader theme is clear: platforms that solve real trading pain points while building sustainable revenue are the ones most likely to deliver life-changing distributions.

Of course, nothing is guaranteed. Points programs can change, TGE timelines can shift, and competition will intensify as more farmers wake up to these opportunities. But that’s the beauty of being early and selective—you’re not chasing every shiny new protocol; you’re focusing capital and effort where the edge is clearest. If you’re sitting on dry powder in this bull market, consider allocating a portion to active farming in these categories. Start small, master delta-neutral setups or market arbitrage, track your points religiously, and stay patient. The next Hyperliquid- or Lighter-sized airdrop is likely already among the platforms quietly accumulating volume today. Good luck out there in 2026. Farm smart, stay neutral when possible, and let’s see what these points turn into.
