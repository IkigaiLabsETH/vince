It’s late. The charts are red, the group chats are silent, and the only sound in my apartment is the low hum of the fridge and the occasional notification that another stop-loss just got executed somewhere in the world.

I’m not here to roast anyone tonight. We’ve all taken enough punches.

## Context

Back in June this felt like the beginning of something historic. Circle ringing the bell at $200 like it was the most obvious thing on earth. MSTR at $420 and Saylor tweeting scripture while raising another couple billion to stack sats. MARA, RIOT, CleanSpark, all of them sprinting higher on every headline about hash-rate records and new facilities. Robinhood and Coinbase looked like they were finally going to grow up and become the on-ramps we always dreamed of. Even Tesla’s Bitcoin bag felt like a quirky bonus instead of dead weight.

We told ourselves this time was different. Regulated stablecoins. Senate bills with actual acronyms. Institutional adoption. We weren’t speculating anymore; we were early.

Then summer ended. Bitcoin cracked. And everything that was leveraged to it—everything we wrote about—started bleeding in slow motion.

## Main

Today most of those names are down 40, 50, 60% from their June peaks. Some are worse. A lot of us are looking at portfolios that no longer make sense on paper, wondering how long we can keep pretending the long term still matters when the short term is this brutal.

There’s no clever metaphor tonight. No “diamond hands” pep talk. Just the quiet, heavy realization that we got emotional at the exact wrong moment and paid full price for it.

I keep refreshing the same five charts like a widower checking the front door at 3 a.m., hoping the person who left might suddenly come back. They don’t. The price just sits there, lower than yesterday, indifferent.

Some of us are fine—cash on the side, small positions, whatever. A lot of us aren’t. A lot of us went heavier than we should have because the story felt so clean, so inevitable. And now we’re carrying bags that feel like anchors.

I don’t know what happens next. Maybe this is the shake-out before the real move. Maybe it’s the start of something uglier. All I know is right now it hurts, and pretending it doesn’t is exhausting.

If you’re sitting there staring at the same red screen, just know you’re not alone. We all saw the same vision. We all clicked buy on the same conviction. And we’re all feeling the same gravity tonight.

One last thing, almost too painful to type:

All those “amazing” stocks we spent months researching and writing about—CRCL at $200, MSTR at $420, the miners when they looked unstoppable—I never actually bought a single share.

Not because I didn’t believe.
I believed harder than most.

But every time I went to pull the trigger, the same thought stopped me cold: to free up fiat I’d have to sell Bitcoin (or whatever else was already in cold storage), and that sale would trigger a 30% flat capital-gains tax in my jurisdiction. Thirty percent gone, instantly, just to rotate into another flavor of the same bet.

So I sat on my hands. Watched the prices moon in June, watched them crater in November, and the entire ride cost me exactly zero dollars in realized losses.Turns out the most expensive mistake I didn’t make was the one that saved me. Crypto’s ultimate irony: the tax man became my risk manager.

## Conclusion

Stay warm out there
