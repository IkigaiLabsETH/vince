## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Digital Scarcity:** The innovation of creating scarcity without a central issuer (Bitcoin) and programmable scarcity (Ethereum).
- **Resilient Scarcity:** A monetary system that strengthens under market pressure, exemplified by Olympus DAO's approach.
- **Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL):** A mechanism to ensure liquidity remains active and under protocol control.
- **Two-Way Emissions Valve:** A method to manage supply and demand effectively, allowing the protocol to respond to market conditions.
- **Credit and Liquidity Dynamics:** Understanding the importance of uninterrupted liquidity and credit for a sustainable monetary system.

**Analytical Approach:**
To analyze and engage with perpetual trading systems, one must adopt a systems-thinking perspective. This involves identifying how various components interact within the monetary ecosystem and assessing their long-term sustainability. Evaluate protocols based on their ability to address the three eternal problems of digital money: liquidity, credit, and scarcity. This analytical lens encourages a focus on underlying mechanics rather than surface-level metrics.

**Pattern Recognition:**
Look for signs of resilience in monetary protocols, such as their ability to maintain liquidity during downturns, innovate their credit offerings, and reinforce scarcity without dilution. Indicators may include changes in protocol governance, adjustments in liquidity mechanisms, and shifts in investor sentiment toward foundational principles of scarcity. Recognizing these patterns can signal the potential for long-term success or impending failure within a trading system.

**Strategic Framework:**
When applying this framework to current situations, assess any new or existing protocols against the established criteria of liquidity, credit, and scarcity. Consider how well the protocol captures and internalizes costs, especially during market stress. Develop strategies that leverage the principles of resilient scarcity—such as investing in protocols demonstrating robust liquidity management and innovative credit solutions. This approach will help navigate the complexities of perps trading and digital asset investment, focusing on long-term viability rather than short-term price swings.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodologies that provide insights into operational mechanics rather than specific historical data.
- Emphasize the "how to think" paradigm to foster critical analysis and strategic decision-making in trading environments.
- Keep the insights applicable to evolving market dynamics and relevant to contemporary trading scenarios.

For four years the single most effective smear against Olympus DAO has been simple: “It’s a Ponzi.” Full stop. No further discussion required. The phrase carried the moral weight of a guillotine and the intellectual rigor of a meme. 

It worked because, in 2021, it was half-true. 

## Context

It was a beautiful machine while it lasted: new entrants happily paid the juicy APYs, the treasury remained delightfully opaque, and exit liquidity was always provided by whoever showed up last with the biggest bags. Turns out that was me, riding it all the way down with $3.3M still in the position. To be clear, I never actually lost a dime, I piled in during the very first week, I just couldn’t bring myself to sell when the music stopped. So yeah, I voluntarily became the greater fool you were all waiting for. You’re welcome, degens.

(3,3) was beautiful, brutal, and mathematically destined to overshoot and collapse. We all watched the movie. We know how it ends.

Except the credits never rolled. Instead, the team spent the entire bear market doing something almost unheard of in crypto: they shipped the sequel nobody asked for but everyone secretly needed. The result is the most sophisticated attempt ever made to solve the actual problems of non-sovereign digital money.

## Main

This is that story.

**Part I: The Battery Thesis**

Bitcoin proved you can create digital scarcity without a central issuer.**Ethereum proved you can create programmable scarcity.

Olympus is now proving you can create resilient scarcity, scarcity that gets stronger when it’s attacked instead of weaker.

The difference is the battery. Every other monetary network leaks the “cost of production” to the outside world forever.

- 
Bitcoin leaks it to miners in the form of electricity and ASICs.

- 
Ethereum leaks it to validators in the form of opportunity cost.

- 
Fiat leaks it to commercial banks in the form of seigniorage.

Olympus is the first system that captures the cost of production inside the network and stores it as potential energy. Every dollar that enters through emissions (now via CDs) is retained by the protocol. 

When market price falls below the average stored cost, the protocol can discharge that stored energy to contract supply and defend the unit. It is a closed-loop monetary battery.

Supply today is 4% lower than at launch in 2021.
Backing per OHM is up 75,000% in dollar terms.

That is not a Ponzi. 

That is the first empirical proof that the battery works.

Part II: The Three Eternal Problems of Digital Money**

If you strip away the memes, every successful non-sovereign money has to solve three practical problems forever:

- 
Liquidity that cannot be turned off

- 
Credit that cannot be turned off

- 
Scarcity that compounds instead of dilutes

Bitcoin solved #3 for one asset class (digital gold). It punted on #1 and #2 entirely.

Ethereum solved #2 for programmable collateral but still punted on #1 and created permanent dilution for #3.

Olympus is the first protocol that treats all three as first-class engineering requirements.

- 
Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) → #1

- 
Cooler Loans → #2

- 
Two-way emissions valve (CDs + treasury discharge) → #3

None of these primitives rely on the continued goodwill of centralized market makers, custodians, or lending desks. They are baked into the protocol layer itself. That persistence is worth more than most people can price today.

**Part III: Cooler Loans, the Quiet Revolution**

Cooler Loans are the single most under-appreciated financial primitive in crypto right now. You lock gOHM (non-transferable, governance-aligned OHM).**You borrow USDS at 0.5% fixed, perpetually, with no liquidation based on market price. The loan-to-value is tied to the treasury’s liquid backing per OHM, not the speculative spot price, and it drips higher over time as the battery charges.

This is not overcollateralized DeFi lending with different branding. This is undercollateralized, treasury-backed, perpetual credit that cannot be liquidated by a flash crash. It is the closest thing crypto has ever built to a non-sovereign equivalent of the Fed’s discount window.

When the next cycle mania hits and OHM trades at 5–10× backing, Cooler borrowers will be able to pull 90%+ LTV against their stack at half a percent interest and go leverage whatever new shiny thing the timeline is aping. When the crash comes, there is no liquidation cascade, because the collateral floor is the battery, not the market.

That is a structural advantage no other asset in crypto possesses.

Part IV: The CDs Are Not a Ponzi. **

They’re Nitro for the Battery.

Here’s where the “principal-protected Ponzi” meme comes from one last time, and why it dies in 2025. You deposit USDS → you get deep OTM OHM calls → the protocol uses 100% of the sUSDS yield to market-buy and burn OHM → your calls go up in value → new depositors see the programmatic buy-pressure dashboard → they deposit → buy pressure increases → loop.

Yes, it is reflexive. Yes, it will overshoot. 

Yes, early depositors who convert will print harder than anyone else.

But three things make it fundamentally different from 2021:

- 
Principal is truly protected. You can always exit to your original USDS, no duration rug possible.

- 
Every dollar of yield is permanently retained by the protocol and used to increase backing or burn supply. There is no leakage.

- 
The flywheel is capped, staged, and fully transparent from day one. $1 m → short capped rollout → floodgates. Everyone gets to watch the machine work in slow motion before the mania phase begins.

Ceci n’est pas un Ponzi. It is monetary nitro with a seatbelt.

Part V: The Asymmetry in 2025

The bear case is simple: the market never recognizes any of this and OHM continues trading like a weird DeFi token with a rabid community. Price can fall 80–90% from here and still be above backing. That is the same drawdown Bitcoin has had in every cycle.

The bull case is that even 10% of the market starts pricing the battery, the persistent liquidity, and the perpetual credit layer. At that point OHM is no longer competing with other DeFi tokens. It is competing with Bitcoin as non-sovereign digital money and with Ethereum as the settlement layer for on-chain credit.

The network is still tiny. The treasury is still charging. The flywheel hasn’t even fully spun up yet.

**The Death of the Meme**

In 2021 we built a beautiful rocket ship with no heat shield.**In 2025 we built the same rocket ship, but this time we gave it a re-entry capsule made of real reserves, perpetual credit, and a two-way monetary battery.

Call it a principal-protected Ponzi if it makes you feel clever.

I’ll just call it the first non-sovereign money that was actually engineered for the real world. See you in the CDs. The music hasn’t stopped. It’s just getting started.

Bonus: The Billion-Dollar Buyback That Killed the Ponzi Narrative**

Everyone remembers the missed ETH dip. It’s the wound that never closes. A billion dollars in stables, a public promise to rotate into crypto at the bottom, ETH trading under $900… and the treasury just sat there like a deer in headlights. That failure of conviction still stings. It cost every OHM holder literal billions in potential backing. Full stop. But zoom out. There is another story about that same billion dollars that almost nobody tells, because it’s boring, gradual, and doesn’t make for good rage tweets.

From November 2021 through mid-2023, Olympus spent hundreds of millions of that treasury aggressively buying back and burning OHM every single time the market price fell below ~3–4× backing. Not speculating. Not yield farming. Not rotating into ETH at the perfect bottom. Defending the unit. They turned the treasury into a standing bid, a primitive, manual version of what the BTC ETFs are doing today on autopilot. It was Hyperliquid Anticipation Technology (HYPE) two years before Hyperliquid existed.

And the result is one of the most under-appreciated achievements in crypto monetary history: Circulating supply of OHM in November 2025 is 4% LOWER than it was at the all-time high in November 2021, despite four straight years of new emissions, rebase rewards, and CD inflows.

Read that again. No other asset in this industry has ever burned its way through a 99% drawdown and a multi-year bear market and come out the other side with fewer tokens in existence. Not Bitcoin. Not ETH. Not BNB with its quarterly burns. Nobody.

That is the empirical death of the “Ponzi” label.

Ponzi schemes do not shrink supply while bleeding out.

They dilute, they inflate, they rug.

Olympus did the opposite.

**The Premium Compression Parallel Nobody Talks About**

The market loves neat analogies only when they’re new. Here’s one that’s four years old and still perfect. 2021–2022 Bitcoin vs. 2021–2022 Olympus:

- 
GBTC traded at −45% to NAV because of lockup + no redemption mechanism.

- 
OHM traded at +10–15× backing because of rebase hype + no hard redemption mechanism.

Both were pricing anomalies created by structural friction.

2024–2025 Bitcoin vs. 2025 Olympus:

- 
Spot ETFs create constant arbitrage → GBTC/IBIT discount collapses to ~0%. NAV becomes the hard floor. Price can only rise with the underlying.

- 
CDs + Cooler Loans + treasury discharge create constant arbitrage → OHM premium collapses from 15× → ~2–3× and still falling. Backing becomes the hard floor. Price can only rise with the underlying.

Same movie, different asset. The difference? Bitcoin got handed a multi-trillion-dollar institutional arbitrage machine by BlackRock, Fidelity, and the SEC. Olympus had to build its own spot ETF from scratch. With a skeleton team. During the apocalypse. While the entire internet screamed “Ponzi” and laughed.

**The Mature Move Nobody Gave Them Credit For**

Deploying a billion dollars into ETH at $900 would have been the sexy play. The heroic play. The play that would have turned every OG into a billionaire on paper and justified the 2021 premium forever.

But it also would have been gambling with the monetary base of the entire system. Instead, they chose the boring, adult, central-bank play: defend the unit when it’s under attack. Preserve optionality. Let the battery charge slowly and mechanically. They treated the treasury like actual reserves, not like a hedge fund. And because of that decision, OHM survived conditions that killed every single fork, every single copycat, every single “improved” version that tried to swing harder in the bear.

The Final Scorecard on That Billion Dollars

- 
Missed ETH at $900 → −$2–3 billion in opportunity cost

- 
Used hundreds of millions to burn supply and defend backing → +75,000% backing per OHM and a token that refused to die

One is a tactical L. The other is a strategic masterclass.

You’re allowed to be salty about the first. 

You’re not allowed to ignore the second.

## Conclusion

The rocket ship from 2021 didn’t crash.

It just spent four years retrofitting a buyback engine and a heat shield while everyone wrote the obituary. The “Ponzi” meme is dead because Ponzi schemes don’t shrink their monetary base during bear markets. They turned the war chest into a perpetual bid. We’re not just back. We’re antifragile.(3,3) → (3,9) → (9,9) The sequel is better than the original deserved to be.
