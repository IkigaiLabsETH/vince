Hyperliquid stands out as this massive beast of a perpetual futures exchange. It’s crushing it with $7.64 billion in open interest, a whopping $3.18 trillion in trading volume, and $4.27 billion locked up in value.

Compare that to the others: Aster’s at $2.61 billion OI, Lighter’s trailing with $1.79 billion, and stuff like GMX or dYdX? They’re basically afterthoughts.

## Context

I’m gonna break down how it got here, and why I’m betting big on onchain equities as the rocket fuel for HYPE, especially with that HIP-3 update.

It broke through the usual on-chain trading headaches with super-fast execution, efficient capital use, and blending spot and derivatives seamlessly. By September 2025, it was pulling in 32% of all blockchain revenue, with monthly volumes over $400 billion. It went from niche experiment to DeFi powerhouse.

> Think about their portfolio margin system they dropped in December, or HIP-3 letting builders create their own perps— that’s pulling in institutions, like VanEck sniffing around for ETFs, and even Hyperliquid Strategies with their vaults. It’s not just an exchange; it’s this thriving ecosystem where liquidity pools up strong, holding up even when everything else crashes.

But yeah, success breeds copycats, and Hyperliquid’s got a swarm of clones trying to one-up it. We’ve got over 20 of these things out there, from Lighter (with fancier order types) to big players on other chains like Drift on Solana. It’s the open-source life: anyone can fork and tweak. Aster grabbed some OI back in mid-2025 by promising better efficiency, and Variational’s in beta but already at $336 million OI, hinting at more to come.

## Main

On X, people are complaining about it; traders are tired of split rewards and the noise from HyperEVM wannabes. The real risk? Liquidity gets fragmented, innovation stalls, and rushed forks open doors to hacks or chain issues.

Hyperliquid’s been solid—no big exploits in 2025—but with competitors like Jupiter integrating, GRVT aiming high, or Backpack tying in wallets, it’s like a slow bleed, splitting the perp market into pieces.

Right in the middle of all this is HYPE, the token that powers governance and utilities on the platform. It’s sitting at about $28 right now, with a market cap around $8-9 billion on 270-337 million circulating tokens, and fully diluted could hit $28 billion. Smart design: 97% of fees go to buybacks, so its value ties directly to revenue. Staking lets you deploy perps and vote on stuff. But there’s this vesting pressure—217,000 HYPE unlocking daily, that’s like $6 million at current prices, stretching out to 2028 and adding 20-25% supply yearly.

Compared to peers, HYPE’s in a league of its own—way bigger than GMX’s $88 million cap or DYDX’s $156 million. It peaked at $59.30 in September, and now it’s in this holding pattern, full of potential but sensitive to market swings.

Here’s where my real excitement kicks in: onchain equities could be the game-changer for HYPE, especially with HIP-3. Builders can now create custom perps on stocks and indices, letting you trade real-world equities on-chain with leverage. That’s huge—pulls in institutions and everyday traders, explodes volumes, and pumps HYPE hard.

Looking ahead, I’ve gotta be realistic about HYPE’s path.

In a bearish scenario, with forks grabbing 20% of OI and unlocks weighing heavy, it might dip to $20-25 by year’s end, hanging around $25-35 into Q1.

Middle ground: Hyperliquid holds its lead with things like MegaVault, pushing to $35-45 by December and $45-60 by mid-2026, even as TVL growth slows.

## Conclusion

Bull case? Onchain equities via HIP-3 light a fire, institutions flood in, buybacks eat up dilution—$50-60 soon, then $70-90 later, with volume hitting trillions.

At the end of the day, Hyperliquid’s tale is a classic DeFi evolution story. Copies might cloud things up, but they just prove the original’s got it right, pushing everyone to level up. HYPE’s got its risks with unlocks, but its utility shines, especially as onchain equities open new doors. Heading into 2026, I’m optimistic but watchful: this could be a smart play for anyone paying attention.
