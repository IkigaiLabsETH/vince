## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Long Squeeze**: Crowded longs get liquidated → rapid price crash
- **Short Squeeze**: Crowded shorts get liquidated → rapid price spike
- **Covered Calls**: Safer - rapid decline unlikely to breach call strikes
- **CSPs**: DANGEROUS - rapid decline can breach put strikes immediately
- **Action**: Widen put strikes significantly or reduce CSP positions

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs

# Squeeze Patterns in Perpetual Futures

Understanding squeeze dynamics for options risk management.

## What is a Squeeze?

A squeeze occurs when crowded positioning forces rapid, violent price moves:

- **Long Squeeze**: Crowded longs get liquidated → rapid price crash
- **Short Squeeze**: Crowded shorts get liquidated → rapid price spike

## Identifying Squeeze Risk

### High Squeeze Risk Indicators

| Indicator | Long Squeeze Risk | Short Squeeze Risk |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Funding Rate | > +0.05% (8h) | < -0.03% (8h) |
| Open Interest | High and rising | High and rising |
| Price Action | Extended rally | Extended decline |
| Liquidation Cascades | Small dips causing liquidations | Small bounces causing liquidations |

### Warning Signs

1. **Funding Extremes**: Rates at multi-week highs/lows
2. **OI Build Without Price Move**: Positions accumulating without corresponding price action
3. **Funding/Price Divergence**: Price flat but funding spiking
4. **Whale Positioning**: Large accounts taking opposite side

## Squeeze Mechanics

### Long Squeeze Cascade
1. Price starts declining
2. Overleveraged longs get margin called
3. Forced selling accelerates decline
4. More longs liquidated → more selling
5. Price crashes 10-30% in hours

### Short Squeeze Cascade
1. Price starts rising
2. Shorts get margin called
3. Forced buying accelerates rally
4. More shorts liquidated → more buying
5. Price spikes 10-30% in hours

## Options Implications

### During Long Squeeze Risk
- **Covered Calls**: Safer - rapid decline unlikely to breach call strikes
- **CSPs**: DANGEROUS - rapid decline can breach put strikes immediately
- **Action**: Widen put strikes significantly or reduce CSP positions

### During Short Squeeze Risk
- **Covered Calls**: DANGEROUS - rapid rally can breach call strikes
- **CSPs**: Safer - rapid rally moves price away from puts
- **Action**: Widen call strikes significantly

## Risk Levels and Strike Adjustments

| Squeeze Risk | Call Strike Adjustment | Put Strike Adjustment |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| None | Standard 20-30 delta | Standard 20-30 delta |
| Low | Standard | Standard |
| Medium | +5 delta wider (25-30) | +5 delta wider (25-30) |
| High | +10 delta wider (30-35) | +10 delta wider (30-35) |
| Extreme | Consider skipping | Consider skipping |

## Historical Squeeze Examples

### Crypto Long Squeezes
- BTC April 2021: -25% in 24 hours after extreme positive funding
- ETH May 2022: -15% rapid decline during crowded longs

### Crypto Short Squeezes  
- BTC October 2021: +15% in hours during crowded shorts
- HYPE Launch: Massive short squeeze as shorts bet against launch

## Monitoring Protocol

1. **Daily Check**: Review funding rates for all target assets
2. **Pre-Friday Review**: Essential before setting weekly options
3. **Intraday Alerts**: Set alerts for funding extremes (>0.05% or <-0.03%)
4. **Cross-Asset Compare**: Check if squeeze risk is isolated or broad

## Integration with Strike Selection

When squeeze risk is elevated:

1. **Identify Direction**: Long squeeze (positive funding) or short squeeze (negative)
2. **Assess Magnitude**: How extreme is the funding?
3. **Adjust Opposite Side**: If long squeeze risk → widen CSPs
4. **Consider Skipping**: Extreme risk may warrant sitting out
5. **Document Reasoning**: Track decisions for pattern learning
