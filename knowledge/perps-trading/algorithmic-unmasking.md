Look, I’ve been scraping words together online since 2004. Back when “content” wasn’t even a noun people used without air quotes. When blogs were ugly Blogger templates and the dream was maybe 10k RSS subscribers and a book deal that never came. I’ve watched every wave crest and crash—dot-com ashes, MySpace glitter, Facebook turning into outrage slot machines, Twitter becoming... whatever the hell CT is now. Crypto promising escape and mostly delivering leverage-fueled therapy bills.

And yeah, that whole “long degeneracy” thing people keep muttering about? The financialization of everything, the loneliness, the tribal screaming, the weirdness? It’s not some mysterious fog that rolled in. We piped it straight into everyone’s pocket.

## Context

Here’s the thing. Real life’s been priced like a luxury good for years now. Houses? Forget it unless your parents won the birth lottery. Stable job that pays enough to breathe? Cute. So what do people do? They gamble. Your buddy’s cousin yoloing options on Robinhood like it’s free money. College kids turning stimulus checks into sports parlays. Random Discord bros pumping memecoins that hit 80 billion in cap one week and evaporate the next. Perps flipping trillions in notional. Online betting revenue creeping toward twenty bil in the US alone. We called it “democratizing finance”. Kind of wild when you say it out loud.

We made the casino irresistible. Notifications pinging like slot handles. Variable rewards that hook harder than cigarettes ever did. Addiction hotlines lighting up, especially with young guys—rates doubling, tripling since everything went legal and seamless. States addicted to the tax revenue, apps baked into every game broadcast. Accessibility. Sure.

I still have my own dumb scar from the early days. Around 2011, trying to bootstrap this little media thing, convinced Google AdWords was my ticket. Maxed out two credit cards bidding on keywords nobody wanted. Thought I was gaming the system. Ended up five grand in the hole, eating ramen, praying freelance gigs wouldn’t bounce. Felt like the world’s biggest moron. Then crypto showed up and I did versions of the same dance—nothing catastrophic, got lucky on some early Bitcoin, but watched friends lever up into nothing. One guy I knew lost his whole nest egg on a “sure thing” token that rugged in like eight hours. Still makes my stomach turn.

## Main

I’m not saying it’s all doom, though. Could be wrong. Plenty of people use the tools without torching their lives—quiet stackers, builders, folks who actually opt out. Bitcoin underneath the meme sludge still feels like hard money to me, a hedge against the slow grind of inflation eating your time. The degen layer? Mostly noise. Fine if it’s play money. Ruinous when it’s rent.

But you’re right—we didn’t get forced into this. We hyped the moonshots, buried the bodies, kept shipping features.

## Conclusion

Honestly, the fix isn’t some grand revolution. Just... stop feeding the machine for five minutes. Next time the itch hits at 3 a.m.—that little twitch to check prices, open the trading app, refresh the timeline—close the damn phone. Put it in another room. Pour a glass of water. Sit there in the quiet. See if the world doesn’t feel a hair less suffocating.

Or don’t. Tell me I’m full of shit and keep swinging.
