# Understanding Funding Rates

## What Are Funding Rates?

Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual futures markets. They serve to keep the perpetual price (mark price) close to the spot price (oracle/index price).

## How Funding Works

### Basic Mechanics
- **Settlement Period**: Every 8 hours (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC)
- **Payment Direction**: 
  - Positive funding: Longs pay shorts
  - Negative funding: Shorts pay longs
- **Calculation**: Funding = Position Size × Funding Rate

### Formula Components
```
Funding Rate = Premium Index + clamp(Interest Rate - Premium Index, -0.05%, 0.05%)
```

Where:
- **Premium Index**: How far mark price deviates from oracle
- **Interest Rate**: Base rate (usually 0.01% per 8h on most exchanges)

## Interpreting Funding Rates

### Bullish Signals
| Funding Level | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| > 0.05% | Extremely crowded long, potential squeeze risk |
| 0.02% - 0.05% | Strong bullish sentiment |
| 0.01% - 0.02% | Mildly bullish |
| ~0.01% | Neutral/balanced market |

### Bearish Signals
| Funding Level | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| < -0.05% | Extremely crowded short, potential squeeze risk |
| -0.02% to -0.05% | Strong bearish sentiment |
| -0.01% to -0.02% | Mildly bearish |

## Funding Rate Strategies

### Funding Arbitrage
1. **Cash and Carry**: Long spot + short perp when funding is high
   - Collect funding while market-neutral
   - Works best in sustained high-funding periods
   
2. **Reverse Cash and Carry**: Short spot + long perp when funding is negative
   - Less common due to borrowing costs

### Squeeze Detection
- **Long Squeeze Setup**:
  - Funding > 0.05% for multiple periods
  - Rising OI (people adding to longs)
  - Price at resistance
  - Risk: Sharp move down forces liquidations

- **Short Squeeze Setup**:
  - Funding < -0.05% for multiple periods
  - Rising OI (people adding to shorts)
  - Price at support
  - Risk: Sharp move up forces liquidations

## Annualized Funding

To compare funding across assets:
```
Annualized Funding = 8h Funding Rate × 3 × 365
```

Example:
- 0.01% per 8h = 10.95% annualized
- 0.05% per 8h = 54.75% annualized

## Best Practices

### For Directional Traders
1. **Avoid extreme funding**: High funding = crowded trade = risk
2. **Use funding as confirmation**: Entry when funding aligns with your view
3. **Monitor multi-day trends**: Single reading less meaningful

### For Options Strike Selection (Friday)
1. **Check weekly funding trend**: Sustained positive = bullish bias
2. **Compare to historical**: Is current funding elevated?
3. **Cross-reference with OI**: Funding + OI tells the full story
4. **Factor into strike distance**: High funding → wider OTM strikes

### Red Flags
- Funding > 0.1% (unsustainable, squeeze risk)
- Funding flipping rapidly (uncertainty)
- Funding diverging from price (potential reversal)
