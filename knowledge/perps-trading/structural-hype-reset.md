## Context

Over roughly two months, HYPE fell from the mid‑$40s–$50 range to around $20. The move was not random and not merely “market conditions.” It reflected **three specific, on-chain-visible sources of sell pressure**, each of which has since largely resolved or exhausted. The forward setup is structurally different from that of two months prior.

---

## 1. Team Unlocks: Supply Everyone Mispriced

**Framework:** Unlocked ≠ distributed ≠ sold ≠ sold on the open market.

Many trackers showed ~9.9M HYPE unlocking per month, implying a ~$200M+ monthly sell overhang. That overstated reality.

**Illustrative data (first two unlock months):**

- **Month 1:** Unlocked ~9.92M; actually distributed ~2.6M; staked back ~1.2M; spot ~300k; sold OTC ~819k; **sold to market ~290k**.
- **Month 2:** Unlocked ~9.92M; distributed ~1.125M; staked back ~375k; spot ~50k; sold OTC ~700k; **sold to market 0**.

In both cases, **~7–10%** of the headline unlock translated into direct or indirect sell pressure. Unlocks behaved as a **gradually declining trickle**, not a cliff.

**Caveat:** OTC sales (e.g. to entities like PURR DAT via Flowdesk) reduce open-market supply but don’t remove demand—they shift *where* demand shows up (CEX vs. DEX). Net effect: unlock reality was misunderstood; it is now largely priced in.

---

## 2. Leverage Reset: Longs Had to Die

**Framework:** One-sided derivatives positioning (e.g. crowded longs on Hyperliquid) invites liquidations and front‑running. Reflexive downside from leverage has to burn off before the market can stabilize.

HYPE entered the period with structurally unhealthy leverage: longs dominated, liquidation heatmaps skewed. What followed:

- Large long liquidations across venues.
- Forced selling from money-market positions (e.g. lend HYPE, borrow USDC, buy more HYPE). These don’t show cleanly on public liquidation heatmaps but add real sell pressure.

**After the reset:**

- Most aggressive longs gone; liquidation profiles more balanced across Binance, OKX, Hyperliquid.
- Reflexive downside from leverage largely exhausted.

This is **not** inherently bullish—it is **necessary** for any later bullish setup. The structural drag from leverage had to clear first.

## 3. The Tornado Cluster and the Anonymous CEX Buyer

**Framework:** Large seller clusters can be absorbed by persistent off‑chain buyers. Market makers (e.g. Wintermute) arbitrage flow between DEX and CEX; they transfer inventory from on-chain sellers to large directional buyers rather than taking directional risk themselves.

A cluster of **16 addresses** (originally funded via Tornado Cash) accumulated ~4.4M HYPE at ~$8.8 avg. Publicly tracked by researchers (e.g. @qwantifyio, @mlmabc). In early January they executed a **highly mechanical** liquidation strategy:

- Roughly one wallet unstaked per day.
- Immediate TWAP selling on unstake.
- No visible execution optimization.

That represented **>$80M** of supply that, in a vacuum, could have pushed HYPE well below $10. It did not—because **absorption** was larger than headline supply.

**Flow:**

1. Tornado cluster sold on HyperCore.
2. **Wintermute** bought on HyperCore and arbitraged to Bybit (e.g. `0xe401…45E8`).
3. Wintermute sold to an **anonymous CEX buyer** on Bybit.

Wintermute was **not** a directional buyer; it transferred inventory from on-chain sellers to a large, persistent off-chain buyer. Over ~30 days, Wintermute arbitraged **>$70M** of HYPE—more than the Assistance Fund’s net buying in the same window.

**Who was buying (illustrative):**

- Top buyers included delta‑neutral players (e.g. Resolv, Auros), market makers, and **anonymous directional** accounts.
- A separate cluster (staking 700–900 HYPE, execution via Flowdesk, HYPE from Bybit) was identified as likely **PURR DAT**. Flowdesk withdrawals from Bybit supported the view that the anonymous CEX buyer absorbing Wintermute’s flow was PURR.

**Other large sellers (illustrative):**

- **Continue Capital:** ~1.3M HYPE (~$28M) over ~2 weeks; still held ~800k staked.
- **Trove:** sold ~500k HYPE.

Despite combined selling from the Tornado cluster, Continue Capital, and Trove, **price held**. Absorption (PURR DAT, Assistance Fund, others) offset supply. Having this supply hit at $20–25 was materially better than at $50+ for absorption cost. By the time of the notes, this sell pressure was **done or almost done**—no major large sellers actively in the market.

## What Changes Now?

The question shifts from **“who is selling?”** to **“what remains to absorb?”**

### 1. PURR DAT Remaining Firepower

**Framework:** Estimate absorbable residual supply (e.g. remaining unlocks) vs. committed capital of known accumulators.

Illustratively: PURR DAT spent ~$67.6M on one cluster; new addresses following the same pattern added ~$11M (e.g. at ~$21 avg). Assuming ~$90M total spent and ~$30M for share buybacks, **~$170M** firepower remained. That implies **residual sell pressure** (e.g. remaining team unlocks) can be **absorbed** rather than amplified, absent new large sellers.

### 2. Perps Market Share

Despite absolute volumes below ATH, **Hyperliquid’s perps share vs. CEXs** was trending up. Open interest had surpassed prior relative ATHs vs. venues like Bybit. Market share → revenue → Assistance Fund flows.

### 3. HIP-3 Volumes

HIP-3 volumes accelerated after @markets_xyz and new exotic markets (e.g. Oil, US Bonds). Recent weekdays exceeded **$1B** daily HIP-3 volume. TradeXYZ remained a leading contributor (>$10M annualized revenue). More volume → more fees → more HYPE buybacks.

### 4. Assistance Fund Behavior

**Framework:** Assistance Fund buybacks scale with volume; when underwater (avg cost above spot), historical pattern aligned with local bottoms.

Data showed consistent buying **>60k HYPE/day**, with several days **>100k**. This does **not** imply uptrend by itself—it means the Fund burns more HYPE as price falls, increasing buy-side support.

### 5. Portfolio Margin

Portfolio margin allows a broader set of assets as collateral, improving **capital efficiency** for delta‑neutral and market‑making strategies. Bybit’s share expanded pre vs. post portfolio margin. On Hyperliquid, the likely effect: structurally higher OI → higher volumes → higher revenue → higher HYPE buybacks.

## Closing Thought

**Two months prior:** HYPE was pricing **unknown** unlock behavior, **excess** leverage, and **large** sellers.

**At the time of the notes:** Unlock reality understood; leverage reset; Tornado cluster and other big sellers done or almost done. Large sales were more likely to be **absorbed** for a while.

That does **not** mean price must go up immediately. It means the **structural reasons it went down** are no longer present. The HYPE/BTC trend was turning.
