## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Asymmetric Bet Analysis:** Evaluating investments where potential rewards significantly outweigh risks, particularly in volatile markets.
- **Market Sentiment vs. Fundamentals:** Understanding the difference between emotional responses to market events and the underlying value proposition of an asset.
- **Supply-Demand Dynamics:** Analyzing how new supply events (like token unlocks) can impact market prices and investor behavior.
- **Buyback Mechanisms:** Understanding how buyback strategies can mitigate supply shocks and support price stability.
- **OTC vs. Market Selling:** Recognizing the implications of over-the-counter transactions versus public market sales on price movements.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Approach market analysis through a lens of behavioral finance, identifying how fear, greed, and historical context influence trading decisions. Assess fundamentals continuously, contrasting them with prevailing market sentiment to gauge potential mispricing.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for historical patterns in token unlock events and their aftermath. Specifically, identify whether prior large transfers led to immediate sell-offs or were absorbed through OTC transactions. Monitor the behavior of key stakeholders, such as builders versus institutional investors, to predict future movements.

**Strategic Framework:**
- Develop a framework for evaluating new investments by considering both the macro environment and specific project fundamentals. Incorporate a checklist that includes examining supply mechanisms, revenue growth trajectories, and historical behavior of stakeholders during critical events. Use this framework to assess current projects in the market, applying lessons learned from previous cycles.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodologies and analytical frameworks rather than specific numerical data or timelines.
- Extract actionable insights that can be applied to current market evaluations and trading strategies.
- Maintain a forward-looking perspective that emphasizes adaptability and critical thinking in volatile environments.

I own a very large bag of $HYPE at an average of $30. I am writing this on November 24, 2025 — five days before the first major cliff unlock on November 29. I am simultaneously long the token, long volatility via secured puts at $25, and now writing covered calls at $33 on Hypersurface to collect 180%+ APR premium while I wait.

This is the story of why I sleep fine at night, why half of Crypto Twitter thinks I’m about to get rekt, and why I believe this setup is quietly one of the highest conviction asymmetric bets in the entire market.

## Context

**Part I – The Thesis in One Paragraph**

Hyperliquid is a fully on-chain order-book perpetuals exchange that bootstrapped itself to $1.3 billion annualized revenue and $4.3 billion TVL with fewer than 20 people and zero VC money. Its token $HYPE routes 97% of protocol revenue into open-market buybacks, has already burned or bought back more than any other Layer-1 governance token in history, and is now facing its first real “insider” unlock cliff. The market is terrified because it has PTSD from 2022. The math says the fear is over-discounted. I agree with the fear, but I think the price is wrong.

**Part II – The FUD Is Real (And That’s Why It’s Cheap)**

## Main

Let’s not sugar-coat it. Starting November 29:

- 
9.92 million $HYPE (currently ~$305 million) unlock on day one

- 
Another ~9.92 million unlock every 30 days for the next 24 months

- 
That is roughly $400–500 million of new monthly supply if every recipient decides to sell everything on-chain

Current daily buyback power from the Assistance Fund + Hyperliquid Strategies TWAP is $3–4 million. That absorbs only 17–24% of the new supply on paper.

Add Arthur Hayes publicly dumping his entire position in September after calling for 126× and you have the perfect emotional cocktail: betrayal + PTSD + ugly vesting schedule = price down 48% from the $59 all-time high and a fully-diluted valuation that has compressed from roughly 90× revenue to ~45× revenue in four months.

The crowd is screaming “team dump incoming.” They are not wrong to be scared. They are just early and wrong about the price.

**Part III – Why This Is Different From Every Other Unlock Massacre**

- 
No VC Overhang**Unlike 95% of 2022–2024 projects, there are no 8-year vesting VCs who need to show their LPs a 2025 exit. The sellers are the actual builders who have been paid nothing but HYPE for two years and who still believe they are building the next Binance.

- 
Proven OTC Behavior
Every prior large transfer from team wallets has been OTC, not market-sold. The recent 2.6 million unstaking event (the one that sent CT into meltdown) has sat quietly in wallets. That is preparation, not panic.

- 
Buyback Flywheel Is Already Working
Since January 2025 the Assistance Fund has removed ~30 million tokens from circulation. That is real deflation, not a marketing slide.

- 
Revenue Is Still Growing, Not Shrinking
August 2025 fees: $105 million
October 2025 fees: $112 million
November 2025 run-rate: $118 million+
This is not a dying protocol praying for volume. It is the second-largest venue for Bitcoin spot trading on earth.

Catalysts Stack Up After the Storm

- 
HyperEVM mainnet (imminent)

- 
Season 2 airdrop (confirmed)

- 
$305 million TWAP buy program vote on December 2

- 
Institutional staking rails live with Anchorage

- 
Proposed 450 million token burn already in governance forum

Part IV – Arthur Hayes and the Psychology of the Perfect Top Signal**

In September, Arthur stood on stage in Tokyo and said $HYPE would 126× to $5,000 by 2028. One week later he sold every token at $52.80.

Crypto Twitter lost its mind. “Hayes dumped, it’s over.”

Here’s the part nobody talks about: Hayes never said the short-term thesis changed. Maelstrom’s research note explicitly said the November cliff was the “first real test” of the tokenomics and that buybacks were insufficient in the near term. He took profits, bought a Ferrari deposit, and kept the long-term model intact.

In crypto, when a loud maxi sells the top and then the price falls another 40%, that is usually the bottom, not the middle.

**Part V – The Trade I Actually Put On (And Why)**

Bag: Very large, average $30

Conviction: This is a multi-year compounder trading at <40× run-rate revenue with a structural buyback engine.

Protection & Offense stack:

- 
Long spot at $30 (diamond hands portion)

- 
Cash-secured puts at $25 strike expiring post-unlock → I am happy to buy more if we puke, and I collect premium while waiting

- 
Covered calls at $33 on Hypersurface → 181% APR, 31% probability of being called away

Net result:

- 
If we rip straight up → called away at $33 + premium → ~13–15% gain in <10 days and I re-enter higher or walk away happy

- 
If we stay flat → keep full bag + 4–5% weekly yield (200%+ annualized)

- 
If we crash to $25 → puts assign, average drops to ~$27.50, and I own even more of the best perp chain in crypto at a cheaper price

This is the rare setup where I get paid in all three directions.

**Part VI – Price Targets & Probabilities (As of Nov 24)**

Short term (by Jan 31, 2026)

- 
55% probability → $38–48 (relief rally + catalysts)

- 
30% probability → $24–29 (full panic, best case for puts)

- 
15% probability → sub-$20 (only if BTC breaks $80k and macro cracks)

2026 (12–18 months)

Base case: $90–120 (revenue 3–4× from HyperEVM + spot market share)**Bull case: $180–250 (if stablecoin volumes explode as Hayes originally modeled)
Bear case: $40–50 (revenue stalls, team sells aggressively OTC)

Part VII – An Open Letter to Jeff and the Hyperliquid Team**

You don’t owe us anything. You already built the best trading venue in crypto and delivered life-changing airdrops without taking a dime of VC money. 

One small personal note: as someone who was here trading and providing liquidity literally from week one (and who never stopped), getting only a 48-hour window to sign the new T&C for the power-user tier stung a little. It ended up costing me an eight-figure airdrop that I’d effectively earned over two years of real volume. I get why the short deadline existed, and I’m still grateful for everything Hyperliquid has built; just wish the most loyal early users had been given an extra week or two to avoid that particular gut punch. Water under the bridge now, but it’s the only scar I carry from an otherwise flawless ride.

But five days of silence before the largest unlock in your history is how narratives die. One tweet. One short post. One on-chain message. Anything that says: “We see the fear. Here is exactly how we are handling vesting. Here is why we are more incentivized than ever to win the decade, not the week.” That is all the market needs. You’ve earned the benefit of the doubt a hundred times over. Use it.

**Final Thought**

Crypto loves to confuse noise with signal. Right now the noise is deafening: unlocks, Hayes, unstaking, PTSD, drawdown charts. The signal is quieter but far more powerful: $1.3 billion annualized revenue, zero VC overhang, 97% of fees buying back tokens, and a team that has executed flawlessly for two straight years. I am not here to shill you a coin. I am here to tell you that fear is loud, cheap tokens are quiet, and sometimes they show up at the exact same time.

## Conclusion

See you on the other side of November 29.

**UPDATE '(Nov 28)**

Postscript: As I hit “publish” on this editorial four days ago, the clock was ticking toward what felt like crypto’s next big betrayal. Now, with the November 29 cliff unlock in the rearview—9.92 million HYPE tokens (~$350 million at today’s prices) dropped into core contributor wallets at precisely 15:30 Beijing time yesterday—it’s time for the scorecard. Spoiler: The storm was more drizzle than deluge, and my bag’s not just intact; it’s up ~20% since I wrote those words.

What we saw (or didn’t): No on-chain fire sale from team addresses. That infamous 2.6 million unstaking event from last week? Still parked quietly, no TWAP dumps or liquidation cascades in sight. OTC chatter on CT hints at off-exchange deals, but nothing’s hit the tape to spike volume or crater price. 

HYPE? It kissed $34 support intraday yesterday, shrugged off a 3% dip, and closed the session at $35.50—flat to up amid BTC’s sideways grind at $92K. Open interest on perps even ticked up 4%, signaling traders smell volatility but not exodus.

Hyperliquid’s revenue machine? Unfazed—November run-rate still eyeing $120 million, with Assistance Fund buybacks mopping up ~$3.8 million yesterday alone, per on-chain trackers.

No VC overlords forcing exits, just builders who bet on the protocol’s decade, not the dump.Trade-wise: My $30 avg spot’s now at a $6 unrealized gain. Long-term unchanged: Base $100–$130 feels conservative with burns and EVM upside. Fear bought cheap entry; resilience delivers the re-rate. If this is the “massacre,” sign me up for seconds. See you at $50. Long $HYPE. What’s your post-unlock play?
