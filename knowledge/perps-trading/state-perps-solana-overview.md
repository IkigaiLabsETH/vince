# BULK: Building State-of-the-Art Perpetuals on Solana

**Source**: [Lightspeed Podcast - Bringing State of the Art Perps to Solana | Jun Bug & kdot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuixkZ0CzMw)

**Guests**: Jun Bug & kdot (BULK co-founders)

## Summary

BULK is building a next-generation perpetuals exchange on Solana, addressing the critical gap in high-performance derivatives trading on the network. Despite Solana's dominance in onchain activity and meme coins, it has lost significant market share to competitors like Hyperliquid in the perpetuals space. The BULK team, coming from a market-making background, identified key technical challenges: Solana's 400ms block times create latency issues for sophisticated traders, compute constraints make risk engines expensive to run, and fee market unpredictability affects execution reliability.

BULK's solution involves a validator-based architecture that achieves sub-20ms latencies while maintaining decentralization. Their "one exchange, infinite markets" vision includes portfolio margin mode allowing cross-margining across positions, native integration with Solana DeFi protocols (Kamino, Lulo, etc.), and a dynamic risk engine capable of supporting various instruments from perpetuals to prediction markets. The platform aims to solve capital efficiency problems where DeFi TVL drops during market volatility as users withdraw to rebalance positions.

## Key Points

• **Solana's Perpetuals Problem**: Despite leading in onchain activity, Solana has lost significant perps market share due to technical limitations - 400ms block times, compute constraints, and fee market unpredictability

• **Sub-20ms Latency Achievement**: BULK uses validator-based architecture to achieve sub-20 millisecond latencies while maintaining decentralization, competing directly with centralized exchanges

• **Portfolio Margin Innovation**: Single portfolio shares margin across all positions, eliminating need to withdraw and redeposit between protocols during market movements

• **DeFi Integration Strategy**: Native integration with lending protocols (Kamino, Lulo) and yield-bearing tokens, allowing users to trade perps using existing DeFi positions as collateral

• **Dynamic Risk Engine**: Flexible infrastructure supporting multiple instruments - perpetuals, prediction markets, native lending/borrowing - with customizable risk parameters per market type

• **Market Maker Background**: Founders' experience as Solana market makers informed their understanding of infrastructure pain points and performance requirements

• **Aggregator Integration Potential**: Exploring integration with Jupiter-style aggregators for perps, potentially offering 100x better price-time priority than Solana block times

• **Timeline**: Open testnet by end of month, mainnet end of Q1/early Q2 2025

## Notable Quotes

> "I think it's been absolutely criminal that for the chain that sees the most net influence and pioneered onchain clubs to lose this much market share to competitors elsewhere"

> "We're trying to focus on this one specific goal that is let's blend highest amount of performance with decentralization and this performance is now sub 20 milliseconds of latencies"

> "One exchange, infinite markets... the core part of that enables all of this is essentially this risk engine that's capable of handling the whole margining side of things"

> "What bulk essentially is going to allow now is you can just connect your wallet and use these positions to start trading perps and you don't have to worry about rebalancing them or withdrawing them"

## Trading/Investment Implications

**Solana Ecosystem Catalyst**: BULK could be a significant catalyst for Solana's DeFi ecosystem, potentially recapturing market share lost to L1 competitors in derivatives trading.

**Capital Efficiency Revolution**: The portfolio margin system could dramatically improve capital efficiency across Solana DeFi, reducing the TVL volatility that plagues lending protocols during market stress.

**Market Structure Evolution**: Sub-20ms latencies could attract institutional market makers and sophisticated trading firms back to Solana, improving liquidity and reducing spreads.

**DeFi Composability**: Native integration with existing Solana protocols creates network effects - success of BULK could drive more activity to integrated lending platforms and yield products.

**Competitive Positioning**: Direct challenge to Hyperliquid's dominance in decentralized perps, potentially creating a two-horse race in high-performance derivatives.

## Action Items

• **Monitor Testnet Launch**: Track open testnet performance metrics and user feedback for early adoption signals

• **Watch DeFi Integration**: Monitor how BULK's launch affects TVL and activity on partner protocols (Kamino, Lulo, etc.)

• **Track Market Maker Adoption**: Sophisticated trader migration from other platforms will be key success indicator

• **Analyze Latency Claims**: Verify sub-20ms performance claims against competitors once live

• **Study Portfolio Margin Impact**: Monitor how cross-margining affects capital efficiency and user behavior patterns

• **Research Validator Economics**: Understand how BULK's validator-based matching affects Solana validator incentives

• **Follow Aggregator Partnerships**: Track potential Jupiter integration and other aggregator relationships
