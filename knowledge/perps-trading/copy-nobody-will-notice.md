## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **First Principles Thinking:** Re-evaluating investment theses from foundational concepts rather than relying on market trends or popular narratives.
- **In-Depth Research:** Emphasizing long-form content that allows for comprehensive analysis over superficial, quick communications.
- **Audience Engagement:** Focusing on a smaller, more invested audience rather than seeking mass appeal, fostering deeper conversations.
- **Invalidation Levels:** Identifying points at which previous assumptions or theses can be deemed incorrect, prompting reevaluation.
- **Private Thought Process:** Shifting focus from public displays of insight to private contemplation and rigorous analysis.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Approach the topic of trading by grounding your understanding in first principles. Continuously question assumptions and validate them against new data. Use a critical lens to dissect both successes and failures in past strategies, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for signs of superficial engagement in the market, such as trending narratives that lack substantive backing. Identify traders who prioritize depth over breadth, as they are likely to possess a more sustainable edge. Recognize shifts in market sentiment that may indicate an underlying change in fundamentals, especially in previously dismissed sectors like DeFi or Bitcoin collateralization.

**Strategic Framework:**
- In current trading situations, apply this framework by committing to long-term analysis rather than chasing short-term trends. Focus on building a robust research methodology that prioritizes quality over quantity—aim for detailed, well-sourced materials that can withstand scrutiny. Engage with a small group of dedicated peers to refine your ideas and gain diverse perspectives without the noise of public opinion.

**Important Notes:**
- This methodology emphasizes the importance of deep understanding over transient data. It encourages traders and analysts to think critically about their beliefs and the evolving market landscape. The goal is to foster a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation, ensuring that strategies remain relevant and informed by rigorous analysis rather than fleeting trends.

After 16 years in crypto, we’ve executed the quietest pivot of our lives. We used to live on Twitter. We were early. Signed up in 2007. Back in the before-CT-times, a single thread could clear decent views in a week, spark debates, land us in group chats with people who actually ship product. Then came 2020–21: we pushed back on the dominant Covid narrative at the exact moment the algorithm gods demanded compliance. The reach didn’t recover. 

Today our tweets die with single-digit impressions. It’s almost performance art at this point: how much signal can you fit into a message that literally nobody will see? So we stopped shouting into the void and started doing the only thing that ever actually mattered: re-underwriting every single one of our investment theses from scratch. Not in 280-character fragments. Not in 15-image carousels designed to game the timeline. But in long, ugly, deeply-researched pieces published on a platform that still lets you write more than a paragraph without being throttled: Substack.

## Context

Here’s the dirty secret nobody in this space wants to admit in 2025: the public timeline became a terrible place to think. It rewards speed, certainty, and performative confidence. It punishes doubt, nuance, and the slow process of changing your mind when the facts do. The median crypto “thesis” today is a vibe with a chart attached, posted by someone who is currently distributing into your bids. We got tired of playing that game. So this is what we’re doing instead:

- 
Every position we hold, every narrative we believe in, every “cycle meta” we think we understand: back to first principles.

- 
Ten-thousand-word autopsies on why we were wrong in 2022, what we missed in 2023, and why certain things that looked dead (Hyperstructures, proper DeFi, Bitcoin as collateral) are suddenly alive again.

## Main

- 
No rocket emojis. No “not financial advice” cop-outs. No teasing a big reveal behind a $500/month paywall. Just the raw notes: sources, data queries, invalidation levels, and the parts where we admit we still have no idea.

The audience will be tiny. That’s not a bug; it’s the entire point. We don’t need 300 k views anymore. We need 150 people who actually read the footnotes. The rest of the market can keep farming points and quoting each other in circles.
> 
There’s a reason the sharpest traders we know all have <5 k followers and post once a quarter: they’re too busy making money to perform insight. Twitter trained us to think in public. Substack is where we remember how to think in private, then publish the scars.

If you’re still here after a decade in this casino, you already know the score: the game is rigged against the loud, the lazy, and the late. The only sustainable edge left is the one you build when nobody’s watching: deeper research, clearer writing, colder execution. So yeah, we’re spending the next year (maybe the rest of the next bear market) quietly rewriting everything we think we know. One long essay at a time. On a platform that doesn’t throttle us for wrongthink. With an audience small enough that we can actually reply to every comment. You probably won’t see it on your timeline. That’s fine. The timeline stopped mattering somewhere around 2021. We’re not here to be influencer of the week.

We’re here to not be poor in 2030.

## Conclusion

See you on Substack.

Or don’t. Either way, the work continues.
