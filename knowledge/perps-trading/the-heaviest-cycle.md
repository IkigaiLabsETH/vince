There is an exhaustion that no spreadsheet ever captures. I have survived crypto winters that felt like arctic warfare, the slow hemorrhage of 2018 when Bitcoin dripped to $3,200, the real-time detonations of Mt. Gox, Terra-Luna, Celsius, FTX, empires that swallowed trust, reputations, billions. I have watched friends disappear from chats, portfolios dissolve, marriages buckle under bad leverage. And still I returned, because I believed in more than price: decentralized money, censorship-resistant value, a shield against the fiat printer. Yet right now, November 2025, I am more tired than I have ever been. Not because I lost everything, not because the wins feel empty, but because the market is gaslighting us all over again.

The numbers are brutal, and they do not lie, though they never breathe either. Early October gave us Bitcoin above $126,000, drunk on post-election euphoria, ETF rivers of cash, the warm glow of a supposedly pro-crypto White House. Total market cap kissed $4 trillion, alts twitched with life, the supercycle felt ordained: Trump, strategic reserves, Paul Atkins at the SEC.

## Context

Then the floor vanished. By mid-November Bitcoin had knifed below $90,000, erasing every 2025 gain, flipping the year red.

As I type on November 20, it claws toward $92,000, but the scar is carved deep: $1.2 trillion vaporized in weeks, single-day liquidations cresting $1 billion, spot Bitcoin ETFs bleeding record outflows, billions sprinting for the exits.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index languishes in “Extreme Fear,” kissing 10-11, lower than post-FTX, lower than Luna’s grave. This is not loud panic. This is quiet, corrosive despair.

## Main

The fatigue is structural, baked into the cycle. We sit nineteen months past the April 2024 halving, precisely where history says peaks mature into punishment. The bull stretched unnaturally long, sedated by political tailwinds and cheap narratives, but the cracks were visible months ago: perpetual-futures leverage gone feral, corporate treasuries mortgaging the future (hello, Strategy averaging $102k), macro winds shifting hard, rate-cut dreams dead, tariff ghosts rising, AI euphoria bleeding into every risk asset. Alt season never came. Bitcoin dominance stayed tyrannical, then teased a dip, yet capital did not rotate, it simply evaporated. Most alts bleed 80-95% from 2021 highs while Bitcoin at least had ETF parachutes. Solana, and the DeFi darlings, all ghosts now. The OGs saw it coming, screamed about overbought RSI, cycle exhaustion, but in crypto, warnings are white noise until the waterfall begins.

This is not a correction, it is a reckoning with ourselves. Trading crypto was always a high-wire act in a windstorm: 24/7 markets, leverage that magnifies ecstasy and agony, Telegram pinging at 3 a.m. with moon emojis or suicide-watch threads. 2025 turned the volume to eleven. The Trump victory whispered “this time is different,” no more winters, only perpetual summer under friendly regulators. We aped harder, levered deeper, certain the cycle had finally broken.

Now decision fatigue is the real epidemic. One friend, in since 2017, made millions in 2021, lost half in 2022, rebuilt in 2024, then watched $500k liquidate in a single November cascade. He closed the screens, took his dog on a walk that lasted hours, texted me, “I can’t tell if I’m resilient or just addicted to the pain.” The losses are financial, yes, but the deeper wound is the relentlessness: Elon’s silence, regulatory hopium, narrative whiplash, RWAs, DePIN, AI agents, memecoins, each flare-up demanding attention, each flame-out feeling like personal failure. “Why didn’t I sell at $126k, why did I average down at $100k?” Self-loathing compounds faster than any position.

After fifteen years in the trenches you start to wonder whether HODLing is courage or Stockholm syndrome.

Meet Sarah, onboarded in the 2020 DeFi summer, quit her job on yield-farm gains, bought a house, lost it all in 2022, waitressed again, clawed back in 2024 with ETFs and Solana memes, then watched November erase 70% and her sleep along with it. Last week she wrote anonymously, “I’m 32 and feel 60. Crypto gave me freedom, then took my soul.” Meet Mike, the analyst who called the 2021 top almost to the day, now silent, X account dormant, TradingView deleted, message short: “The charts win, we just bleed.”

And then there is me, writing another winter essay, staring at my portfolio and feeling nothing, no rage, no FOMO, only marrow-level weariness, the kind that asks why I ever cared about on-chain metrics in the first place.

> What chills me this time is the silence. No “have fun staying poor” taunts, no diamond-hand copium, Discord servers turning into mausoleums, timelines filled with cryptic “touching grass” posts. People are not rage-quitting, they are ghosting, logging off, rediscovering daylight, relationships, sleep. And maybe that quiet exodus is the healthiest rebellion crypto has ever witnessed. The cypherpunk dream was never lambos or 100x flips, it was sovereignty, financial and mental, freedom from centralized control and from the infinite grind of candlesticks. If a decade of charts has frayed your nervous system, stepping away might be the purest expression of that original ideal.

I am not calling the bottom (though extreme fear this low has historically birthed monsters). Bitcoin will rise again, perhaps $110k+ by year-end if macro cooperates, perhaps lower if tariffs bite. New narratives will bloom, tokenized assets, privacy rails, whatever comes next. None of it matters if the builders and dreamers are hollowed out.

So if your eyes are red from charts, your chest heavy with “what ifs,” hear this: you are not alone, you are not weak, you are human. Crypto, with its demand for infinite stamina, is the one failing us right now.

Close the apps. Walk. Read a paper book. Phone someone who thinks a nonce is just a British insult. The blockchain will still be here when you return. You, however, deserve to leave for a while.

## Conclusion

The heaviest cycle was never the price, it was the one inside your skull. Break it.

Thanks for reading. If this landed, tell me your own story below, survival or surrender, I want to hear it. And if you are stepping away for a bit? Good. The chain isn’t going anywhere. You should.
