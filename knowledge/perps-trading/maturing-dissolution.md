Cantor Fitzgerald’s landmark 62-page report on Hyperliquid—released December 16, 2025—isn’t just a bullish valuation exercise. It’s a profound validation of the thesis that “crypto” as a self-contained, insular industry is dying, and that this death is the pathway to massive, world-changing scale.

We agree wholeheartedly with Cantor’s core conclusions: In their 10-year model, Hyperliquid captures enough volume migration from centralized exchanges to generate $5 billion in annual fees, valued at a 50x multiple for a $HYPE market cap exceeding $200 billion. They initiate Overweight ratings on the ecosystem’s Digital Asset Treasuries (PURR at ~$5 target, HYPD at ~$4 target), framing these as regulated, yield-generating vehicles for traditional investors to access Hyperliquid’s economics through staking, validation, and active deployment.

## Context

But what makes this report truly remarkable—and deeply aligned with the view that crypto’s separate “bubble” is dissolving—is how Cantor treats Hyperliquid not as speculative DeFi, but as foundational trading infrastructure. They liken it to Solana’s breakout last cycle: a high-performance Layer-1 that’s less “crypto-native casino” and more “exchange of all exchanges.”

Why Hyperliquid Exemplifies Crypto’s Transition to the Backend\*\*

Hyperliquid isn’t optimizing for the closed-loop, crypto-for-crypto meta that defined the past decade:

## Main

- No heavy reliance on points farming, emissions, or referral games to recycle the same mercenary wallets.

- Instead: Superior on-chain order books, sub-second finality, deep liquidity, and a fee structure where 99% of revenue funds open-market $HYPE buybacks and burns—directly accruing value to holders as volume grows.

- YTD 2025: ~$3 trillion in volume, $874 million in fees, proving real product-market fit in perpetuals (and expanding to spot + HIP-3 user-created markets).

This isn’t building a better casino for degens already living on-chain. It’s constructing global, permissionless rails that can quietly underpin broader markets—exactly the “dissolution into everything else” that’s required for crypto to win at scale.

Cantor explicitly calls out the addressable market: Perpetual volumes on centralized exchanges topped $60 trillion in 2025. Even modest share gains (e.g., 1% migration) add hundreds of millions in annual fees. Traders will flow to the venue with best execution and liquidity, not temporary incentives. “Point tourists” come and go; durable infrastructure endures.

**The Bridge to the Real World: DATs and Institutional On-Ramps**

The Overweight initiations on PURR (Hyperliquid Strategies) and HYPD (Hyperion DeFi) are the killer feature here. These aren’t passive holders—they’re active treasuries that stake, validate, and market-make with $HYPE holdings, generating yields while providing regulated equity exposure.

**This is crypto dissolving its sharp edges:**

- Traditional investors get upside without needing wallets, seed phrases, or crypto-native rituals.

- No more assuming the world becomes like us; instead, we embed into their systems.

- As the report notes, these DATs trade at discounts to NAV today—creating an entry for institutions wary of direct token exposure.

Coinciding developments reinforce this: Bitwise’s amended $HYPE spot ETF filing, proposals to burn Assistance Fund tokens (~10-13% supply reduction), and Hyperliquid’s expansions (HyperEVM, portfolio margin).Current Context (as of December 17, 2025)

- $HYPE FDV: ~$27 billion (price ~$27, down ~55% from ATH).

- Circulating market cap: ~$9 billion.

- From here to $200B+ implies ~7-10x upside on FDV—plausible if Hyperliquid becomes the default decentralized venue as on-chain trading migrates from CEXs.

Risks remain: Ongoing unlocks, competition (though Cantor argues liquidity moats win), and macro volatility. Short-term price can lag; long-term economics are tied to real volume.

**The Bigger Picture: Crypto Dies, Infrastructure Lives**

> This report arrives at the exact moment the old playbook—liquidity mining loops, hype cycles aimed at CT—shows fatigue. Hyperliquid succeeds precisely because it transcends that: It’s boring where it needs to be (reliable execution, transparent mechanics) and innovative where it matters (programmable, global, user-owned rails).

Crypto doesn’t win by dragging everyone into our bunker. It wins when the bunker opens, the tech becomes invisible backend plumbing, and billions benefit without ever calling themselves “crypto natives.”Cantor Fitzgerald—a firm managing Tether reserves and underwriting U.S. Treasuries—devoting 62 pages to this vision isn’t noise. It’s the sound of the walls coming down.

## Conclusion

Hyperliquid isn’t just a trade. It’s proof that the death of “crypto” as a self-referential world is the gateway to something vastly larger.

Long live the rails.
