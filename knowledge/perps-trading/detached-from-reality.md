I grew up on the internet and still love it. It has given me friends, jobs, laughter, and endless knowledge. Yet something broke in me during the COVID era and its aftermath. For years I worked remotely in crypto, spent every spare moment on CT, and fell into a doom loop of digital addiction I couldn’t escape.

It fried my brain.

## Context

This year I took a long break to reset and examine my relationship with the web—and with technology in general. These are the notes from that reckoning.

We are more online than ever. That much is obvious without statistics. What changed for me, and I suspect for many others, is that the internet stopped being a tool I picked up each day and became my default state of being.

I was always on.

## Main

We are not built for terminal online lives. We are not wired to fill every idle moment with doomscrolling, notifications, and global information firehoses. The result is sensory overload, followed by predictable casualties: anxiety, depression, envy, insecurity, shrinking attention spans, ruined sleep.

The damage extends beyond the personal. When billions of people consume the same algorithmically curated feeds on TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and X, we begin to think, create, and express ourselves in increasingly similar ways.

Call it algorithmic flattening: our once-spiky individuality is sanded down into a smooth, standard shape. Originality and creativity suffer on a civilizational scale.

Most of us who live deeply online feel these effects viscerally. We know the secondary harms, yet many of us have quietly surrendered. We make excuses—“just one more hour,” “everyone else is doing it,” “the world is moving online anyway.” The uncomfortable truth is that we are addicts, willingly dripping engineered dopamine poison into our veins rather than confronting our choices and the systems that profit from them. As Neil Postman warned decades ago, we are amusing ourselves to death.

This is not meant to shame anyone; I am easily the worst offender in my own circle. I have done everything wrong and lived for years in a multi-screen dystopia of endless slop at 2x speed. I write this because I finally woke up and realized I want more from life than infinite digital regret—and I suspect I’m not alone.

The same pattern of engineered dependency appears in another domain that shapes modern life even more profoundly: our monetary system.

Most people believe banks act as intermediaries, lending out deposits. They do not. When a bank issues a loan, it creates new money ex nihilo as a credit entry in your account. Your signed loan agreement becomes an asset on the bank’s balance sheet, and the new deposit instantly expands the money supply.

Banks are not intermediaries—they are credit creators. And crucially, the money they create is interest-bearing. The principal enters circulation, but the interest does not. For the system to function without mass defaults, it requires perpetual growth and constant new debt creation. This private credit system is inherently inflationary and extractive over time.

Governments follow a similar script. Rather than creating new money directly for public spending, they issue bonds purchased by banks, pension funds, foreign governments, or the central bank. This is borrowing the currency they themselves sovereignly issue—essentially printing by proxy through promises to pay interest.

Government-issued money is also interest-bearing, carrying the same growth imperative. Taxes in a fiat system serve three core monetary functions:

- To prevent runaway inflation from excess spending by removing money from circulation—acting as a drain.

- To create demand for the currency, since taxes must be paid in it.

- To redistribute wealth and fund services—though the latter is more political justification than monetary necessity.

The crucial misunderstanding: governments spend new money into existence first, then tax some of it back out (destroying it) to maintain balance.

If new money chases the same goods without increasing real output, prices rise. Bailouts, unproductive war spending, consumption-driven stimulus—all require taxation to mop up excess liquidity.

Conversely, when new money funds genuine productive output—infrastructure, energy projects, factories, goods—the money supply grows in proportion to real wealth. No inflation occurs, and taxation is not needed to offset the issuance.

Historical proof exists. After Weimar hyperinflation and the Great Depression, Germany in 1934 introduced Mefo bills: government promissory notes issued directly to companies for public works and industry. Backed not by gold or bank borrowing, but by future productive labor, they carried no compounding interest. Money entered circulation only as real output was created. Unemployment fell from 30% to near zero in a few years with minimal inflation—until later shifts to unproductive military spending disrupted the balance.

Today’s system is a public–private hybrid: private banks create most money through interest-bearing loans, governments borrow at interest through bonds, and citizens are taxed to stabilize inflation generated by both while servicing the interest that flows upward. The state has outsourced its sovereign money power to private institutions, then taxes the public to manage the consequences. Losses are socialized, gains privatized.

Both the attention economy and the debt-money system run on engineered scarcity and perpetual growth imperatives. One extracts your time and focus, the other your labor and future earnings—often in service of the same financial interests.Deep breath. All is not lost.

The internet remains fun, funny, connective, and abundant. Most of my closest friends were made online. Every adult job I’ve had came through an online presence. Few would deny the genuine goods the web delivers. I am not arguing we should log off forever; that’s neither possible nor desirable. The same applies to money: we need a medium of exchange, and digital tools can improve it dramatically.

The real questions are parallel: Where is the line? Who creates the money and attention flows? On what terms? How much is enough?

There is no universal prescription. Each of us must draw personal boundaries with screens and spending, credit and scrolling. Yet the common thread remains: greater intentionality benefits everyone.

Individuals can reclaim attention and financial agency. Cultural tides are shifting against unchecked platform power and endless debt growth.

Individual choice is powerful. Carrots beat sticks: fall in love again with real life—conversation, craft, nature, productive work—and the pull of endless feeds and easy credit weakens naturally.

None of this needs to feel overwhelming. Small moves matter: leave the phone outside the bedroom, eat breakfast before checking feeds, question every new loan, track where your time and money actually go.

## Conclusion

Life is supposed to be more than perpetual scrolling and perpetual debt.

We can still claim the best of the internet and sound money without letting either claim us. TLDR: stack sats, stay humble, and go touch some grass.
