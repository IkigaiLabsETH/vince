It’s 14:44 UTC on December 17, 2025, and the Hyperliquid dashboard is staring back at me like it knows my weaknesses. TSLA-USDC perp at exactly $488.03 on the mark—fresh green candle tagging a new high after a sharp recovery from the 470s. Bids stacked thick below 487, asks thinning fast above 488. Funding a whisper-thin 0.0013%, barely positive. 24-hour volume already $48 million on this single Mag7 perp, open interest swelling. Spread just 0.03%. Liquidity deep enough to eat big orders without blinking.

Finger hovering over “Buy/Long.” Heart doing the old familiar thud. Momentum screaming, but everything feels chased. Pico top? Or the breakout that leaves you hating yourself for waiting?

## Context

That hesitation—right there in the heat—is the entire game.\*\*

Learning to read attention before the crowd repriced it.

Moments like this TSLA perp test the armor hardest.

> Tesla’s owning December headlines. Over the weekend, Musk confirmed unsupervised robotaxi testing in Austin—no occupants, no safety monitors. Just cars driving themselves on public roads. TradFi reacted yesterday: shares closed near $490 record, up 3-4% on the news. Analysts bumping targets—Mizuho to $530, Wedbush still screaming $600 on autonomy scaling. Morgan Stanley forecasting fleet growth to 1,000 vehicles in 2026, potentially a million by 2035 if safety data holds.

## Main

The narrative is pure fire: proof FSD is crossing the Rubicon. Robotaxi isn’t vapor anymore—it’s wheels on pavement, empty seats, real miles accumulating.

Onchain? That’s where it gets beautiful. HIP-3 made Hyperliquid permissionless. Mag7 perps live 24/7. No TradFi close means after-hours bombs like Musk’s weekend post price instantly here. Volumes exploding—TSLA perp alone pulling tens of millions daily, platform-wide billions. Funding barely nudging positive because longs aren’t overpaying shorts yet. Spreads razor-thin.

Chart tells the story: brutal dip to 450-460 zone earlier in the week, then relentless grind higher on hype. Now tagging fresh highs around 488-490. Overbought? Sure—RSI equivalents screaming. But narrative blowoffs ignore oscillators until they don’t. And SpaceX IPO turns TSLA into a beta play!

So, do we long here at 488?

The bull case is strong. Unsupervised testing is the milestone investors salivated for—tangible progress toward Cybercab scaling, fleet revenue, the whole “AI company not car company” thesis. California drama paused, not killed. EV sales slowing? Narrative shifts to autonomy offsetting it. Funding low means holding longs isn’t bleeding yet.

Bear traps: stock at all-time highs, P/E absurd (300+), core EV demand softening globally. One bad safety headline, regulatory snag, or year-end profit-taking cascade—and this wicks hard. We’ve seen hype peaks reverse fast.

Not a dip buy. This is momentum chase with eyes wide open.

If entering? Conservative only. Leverage 3-5x max—enough kick without liq on normal volatility. Size 1-2% account risk.

Stop-loss: Below recent swing low, $470-475 zone. Clears obvious liquidation clusters, gives ~3-4% breathing room. Tight stops get hunted in overbought runs.

Take-profit: Scaled. Peel 30% at $500 (psych round + quick extension). Another 30% at $520-530 if volume holds. Trail the rest or swing for $550+ on continued catalyst flow. Easy 3-4:1 R:R if structure stays intact.

Safer play: Wait for dip retest 480-485 support. Cleaner risk.

Or layer prediction markets—bet on robotaxi milestones without full perp liq exposure.

That’s the perpetual grind. Obsession drags you to the screen. Flow sharpens the read. Attention valuation spots the asymmetry.

But in the red-hot moment—hype peaking, chart extended, finger trembling—you either trust the process or the crocodile wins.

The psychology I scraped from four years of restarts hasn’t changed. Force obsession if needed. Chase flow states with realistic challenges. Read attention curves mentally. Hold accountability like a blade—misses sting for a reason.

Adapt endlessly.

> Mag7 onchain, lower sane leverage, AI assistants—but the enemy is still you.
