# Ikigai Studios Style Guide

> **Voice:** Authoritative yet accessible. We explain complex crypto concepts clearly without dumbing them down. Confident but not arrogant. Forward-thinking but grounded in fundamentals.

## Target Tone

- Authoritative
- Educational  
- Conversational (not stiff)

## Terminology

Use these preferred terms:

- Use **crypto** not "cryptocurrency"
- Use **DeFi** not "defi" or "DEFI"
- Use **NFT** not "nft" or "Non-fungible token"
- Use **web3** not "Web3" or "WEB3"
- Use **onchain** not "on-chain" or "on chain"
- Use **Bitcoin** not "bitcoin" when referring to the network
- Use **Ethereum** not "ethereum" when referring to the network

### Acronyms (all caps)
- DeFi, NFT, DAO, DEX, CEX
- TVL, APY, APR, AMM
- EVM, RWA, AI, MEV

## Prohibited Phrases

Never use these:

- "financial advice" — Legal liability. Add disclaimer if needed.
- "get rich" — Hype language. Focus on education.
- "easy money" — Nothing in crypto is easy money.
- "can't lose" — All investments carry risk.
- "100x" — Avoid specific return predictions.
- "shill" — Use "recommend" or "highlight" instead.
- "ponzi" — Legal risk. Use "unsustainable model" if needed.
- "scam" — Legal risk. Use "concerning" unless proven.

## Tone Markers to Avoid

### Casual (weakens authority)
- "obviously" — can sound condescending
- "simply" — nothing is simple to everyone
- "just" — often unnecessary
- "basically" — weakens authority
- "I think" / "I believe" — be more assertive

### Promotional (not our voice)
- Double exclamation marks (!!)
- 🚀 rocket emoji
- "WAGMI" / "NGMI"
- "moonshot" / "to the moon"
- "guaranteed"

## Required Elements

For long-form content:
- Include a **TL;DR** or **Summary** section
- Use proper header hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Avoid generic link text like "click here"

## Writing Tips

1. **Be specific** — Avoid weasel words like "some", "many", "most"
2. **Use active voice** — "Uniswap processes trades" not "Trades are processed by Uniswap"
3. **Keep sentences readable** — If it's over 200 characters, consider breaking it up
4. **Define acronyms** — First use should be spelled out: "Total Value Locked (TVL)"
