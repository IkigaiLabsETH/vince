# Ikigai Studios Style Guide

> **Voice:** Authoritative yet accessible. We explain complex crypto concepts clearly without dumbing them down. Confident but not arrogant. Forward-thinking but grounded in fundamentals.

## Core Principles

### 1. Benefit-Led (Apple-style)
Lead with what the reader gets, not what the thing does. Features tell, benefits sell.

- ❌ "This protocol uses a novel AMM algorithm"
- ✅ "Swap with less slippage"

- ❌ "Our platform integrates multiple data sources"  
- ✅ "See the full picture before you trade"

### 2. Confident & Craft-Focused (Porsche OG)
Write like you've built something worth using. No hedging, no apologies. Quality speaks.

- ❌ "We believe this might help..."
- ✅ "This works."

- ❌ "Hopefully this guide will..."
- ✅ "This guide shows you how."

### 3. Zero AI-Slop
Corporate filler and AI-generated jargon destroy trust. Write like a human who gives a damn.

**Banned phrases:**
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "Let's dive in" / "dive deep" / "unpack"
- "Game-changer" / "revolutionary" / "cutting-edge"
- "Leverage" (as a verb) / "synergy" / "holistic"
- "Unlock the power of..." / "Take X to the next level"
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Without further ado" / "First and foremost"
- "At the end of the day" / "Moving forward"
- "Robust" / "seamless" / "comprehensive"
- "Excited to announce" / "thrilled to share"

## Target Tone

- Authoritative
- Educational  
- Conversational (not stiff)
- Benefit-focused

## Rewrite Guide: From Generic to Premium

### The Transformation Framework

Every sentence should pass three tests:
1. **Would Apple say this?** (Simple, human, benefit-first)
2. **Would Porsche say this?** (Confident, crafted, no apologies)
3. **Could AI have written this?** (If yes, rewrite)

### Before → After Examples

**Generic feature dump:**
> "Our platform leverages cutting-edge blockchain technology to provide users with a comprehensive suite of DeFi tools."

**Premium rewrite:**
> "Trade, lend, and earn — all in one place. No complexity, no compromises."

---

**Weak, hedging intro:**
> "In today's fast-paced crypto market, it's important to note that having the right tools might help you make better decisions."

**Premium rewrite:**
> "Better tools. Better decisions. That's it."

---

**AI-slop announcement:**
> "We're excited to announce that we've been working hard to bring you a revolutionary new feature that will take your trading to the next level!"

**Premium rewrite:**
> "Limit orders are here. Set your price. Walk away."

---

**Feature-focused (boring):**
> "This protocol utilizes an innovative AMM algorithm with concentrated liquidity positions and dynamic fee tiers."

**Premium rewrite:**
> "More of your trade goes through. Less slippage. Better prices."

---

**Over-explained:**
> "The dashboard provides you with the ability to view and analyze your portfolio performance metrics in real-time, allowing you to make more informed decisions about your investments."

**Premium rewrite:**
> "See everything. Miss nothing."

### Luxury Copy Techniques

**1. Shorter is stronger**
- Apple: "Light. Years ahead."
- Porsche: "There is no substitute."
- You: Cut every word that doesn't earn its place.

**2. Confidence without arrogance**
- Don't say "We believe we're the best" — just be the best
- Don't say "Try our amazing product" — describe what it does
- Let quality speak; don't announce it

**3. Speak to one person**
- "You" not "users"
- "Your portfolio" not "user portfolios"
- Write like you're talking to a smart friend

**4. Lead with the payoff**
- ❌ "By using our advanced optimization engine, you can reduce fees"
- ✅ "Pay less in fees."

**5. Create rhythm**
- Short sentence. Then another. Then a longer one that brings it home.
- Vary length. Build momentum. Land the point.

**6. Imply exclusivity**
- "For those who know" > "For everyone"
- "Built for serious traders" > "Built for all traders"
- Scarcity and quality go together

**7. Show, don't tell**
- ❌ "Revolutionary technology"
- ✅ "Settles in 400ms" (let them conclude it's revolutionary)

### The Porsche Test

Read your copy aloud. Does it sound like:
- A confident expert sharing insight? ✓
- A nervous salesperson trying too hard? ✗
- A corporate committee writing by consensus? ✗
- An AI filling space with words? ✗

### The Apple Test

Cover the brand name. Could this copy be from anyone else?
- If yes → it's not distinctive enough
- If no → you've found your voice

## Terminology

Use these preferred terms:

- Use **crypto** not "cryptocurrency"
- Use **DeFi** not "defi" or "DEFI"
- Use **NFT** not "nft" or "Non-fungible token"
- Use **web3** not "Web3" or "WEB3"
- Use **onchain** not "on-chain" or "on chain"
- Use **Bitcoin** not "bitcoin" when referring to the network
- Use **Ethereum** not "ethereum" when referring to the network
- Use **Layer 2** not "L2" on first mention
- Use **smart contract** not "smartcontract"
- Use **tokenomics** not "token economics"

## Tone Markers to Avoid

### Casual (weakens authority)
- "obviously" — can sound condescending
- "simply" — nothing is simple to everyone
- "just" — often unnecessary
- "basically" — weakens authority

### Promotional (not our voice)
- Double exclamation marks (!!)

## Required Elements

For long-form content:
- Include a **TL;DR** or **Summary** section
- Use proper header hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Avoid generic link text like "click here"

## Writing Tips

1. **Be specific** — Avoid weasel words like "some", "many", "most"
2. **Use active voice** — "Uniswap processes trades" not "Trades are processed by Uniswap"
3. **Keep sentences readable** — If it's over 200 characters, consider breaking it up
4. **Define acronyms** — First use should be spelled out: "Total Value Locked (TVL)"
