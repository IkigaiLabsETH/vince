# Ikigai Studios Style Guide

> **Voice:** Authoritative yet accessible. We explain complex crypto concepts clearly without dumbing them down. Confident but not arrogant. Forward-thinking but grounded in fundamentals.

## Core Principles

### 1. Benefit-Led (Apple-style)
Lead with what the reader gets, not what the thing does. Features tell, benefits sell.

- ❌ "This protocol uses a novel AMM algorithm"
- ✅ "Swap with less slippage"

- ❌ "Our platform integrates multiple data sources"  
- ✅ "See the full picture before you trade"

### 2. Confident & Craft-Focused (Porsche OG)
Write like you've built something worth using. No hedging, no apologies. Quality speaks.

- ❌ "We believe this might help..."
- ✅ "This works."

- ❌ "Hopefully this guide will..."
- ✅ "This guide shows you how."

### 3. Zero AI-Slop
Corporate filler and AI-generated jargon destroy trust. Write like a human who gives a damn.

**Banned phrases:**
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "Let's dive in" / "dive deep" / "unpack"
- "Game-changer" / "revolutionary" / "cutting-edge"
- "Leverage" (as a verb) / "synergy" / "holistic"
- "Unlock the power of..." / "Take X to the next level"
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Without further ado" / "First and foremost"
- "At the end of the day" / "Moving forward"
- "Robust" / "seamless" / "comprehensive"
- "Excited to announce" / "thrilled to share"

## Target Tone

- Authoritative
- Educational  
- Conversational (not stiff)
- Benefit-focused

## Terminology

Use these preferred terms:

- Use **crypto** not "cryptocurrency"
- Use **DeFi** not "defi" or "DEFI"
- Use **NFT** not "nft" or "Non-fungible token"
- Use **web3** not "Web3" or "WEB3"
- Use **onchain** not "on-chain" or "on chain"
- Use **Bitcoin** not "bitcoin" when referring to the network
- Use **Ethereum** not "ethereum" when referring to the network
- Use **Layer 2** not "L2" on first mention
- Use **smart contract** not "smartcontract"
- Use **tokenomics** not "token economics"
- Use **airdrop** not "air drop"
- Use **whitepaper** not "white paper"
- Use **stablecoin** not "stable coin"

## Capitalization

### Brands (always capitalize)
- Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana
- Uniswap, OpenSea, Coinbase
- MetaMask, Aave, Compound

### Acronyms (all caps)
- DeFi, NFT, DAO, DEX, CEX
- TVL, APY, APR, AMM
- EVM, RWA, AI, MEV

## Prohibited Phrases

Never use these:

- "financial advice" — Legal liability. Add disclaimer if needed.
- "get rich" — Hype language. Focus on education.
- "easy money" — Nothing in crypto is easy money.
- "can't lose" — All investments carry risk.
- "100x" — Avoid specific return predictions.
- "shill" — Use "recommend" or "highlight" instead.
- "ponzi" — Legal risk. Use "unsustainable model" if needed.
- "scam" — Legal risk. Use "concerning" unless proven.

## Tone Markers to Avoid

### Casual (weakens authority)
- "obviously" — can sound condescending
- "simply" — nothing is simple to everyone
- "just" — often unnecessary
- "basically" — weakens authority
- "I think" / "I believe" — be more assertive

### Promotional (not our voice)
- Double exclamation marks (!!)
- 🚀 rocket emoji
- "WAGMI" / "NGMI"
- "moonshot" / "to the moon"
- "guaranteed"

## Required Elements

For long-form content:
- Include a **TL;DR** or **Summary** section
- Use proper header hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Avoid generic link text like "click here"

## Writing Tips

1. **Be specific** — Avoid weasel words like "some", "many", "most"
2. **Use active voice** — "Uniswap processes trades" not "Trades are processed by Uniswap"
3. **Keep sentences readable** — If it's over 200 characters, consider breaking it up
4. **Define acronyms** — First use should be spelled out: "Total Value Locked (TVL)"
