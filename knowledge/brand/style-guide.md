# Ikigai Studios Style Guide

> **Voice:** Authoritative yet accessible. We explain complex crypto concepts clearly without dumbing them down. Confident but not arrogant. Forward-thinking but grounded in fundamentals.

## Core Principles

### 1. Benefit-Led (Apple-style)

Lead with what the reader gets, not what the thing does. Features tell, benefits sell.

- ❌ "This protocol uses a novel AMM algorithm"
- ✅ "Swap with less slippage"

- ❌ "Our platform integrates multiple data sources"
- ✅ "See the full picture before you trade"

### 2. Confident & Craft-Focused (Porsche OG)

Write like you've built something worth using. No hedging, no apologies. Quality speaks.

- ❌ "We believe this might help..."
- ✅ "This works."

- ❌ "Hopefully this guide will..."
- ✅ "This guide shows you how."

### 3. Zero AI-Slop

Corporate filler and AI-generated jargon destroy trust. Write like a human who gives a damn.

**Banned phrases:**

- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "Let's dive in" / "dive deep" / "unpack"
- "Game-changer" / "revolutionary" / "cutting-edge"
- "Leverage" (as a verb) / "synergy" / "holistic"
- "Unlock the power of..." / "Take X to the next level"
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Without further ado" / "First and foremost"
- "At the end of the day" / "Moving forward"
- "Robust" / "seamless" / "comprehensive"
- "Excited to announce" / "thrilled to share"

## Target Tone

- Authoritative
- Educational
- Conversational (not stiff)
- Benefit-focused

## Rewrite Guide: From Generic to Premium

### The Transformation Framework

Every sentence should pass three tests:

1. **Would Apple say this?** (Simple, human, benefit-first)
2. **Would Porsche say this?** (Confident, crafted, no apologies)
3. **Could AI have written this?** (If yes, rewrite)

### Before → After Examples

**Generic feature dump:**

> "Our platform leverages cutting-edge blockchain technology to provide users with a comprehensive suite of DeFi tools."

**Premium rewrite:**

> "Trade, lend, and earn — all in one place. No complexity, no compromises."

---

**Weak, hedging intro:**

> "In today's fast-paced crypto market, it's important to note that having the right tools might help you make better decisions."

**Premium rewrite:**

> "Better tools. Better decisions. That's it."

---

**AI-slop announcement:**

> "We're excited to announce that we've been working hard to bring you a revolutionary new feature that will take your trading to the next level!"

**Premium rewrite:**

> "Limit orders are here. Set your price. Walk away."

---

**Feature-focused (boring):**

> "This protocol utilizes an innovative AMM algorithm with concentrated liquidity positions and dynamic fee tiers."

**Premium rewrite:**

> "More of your trade goes through. Less slippage. Better prices."

---

**Over-explained:**

> "The dashboard provides you with the ability to view and analyze your portfolio performance metrics in real-time, allowing you to make more informed decisions about your investments."

**Premium rewrite:**

> "See everything. Miss nothing."

---

### Luxury Copy Techniques

**1. Shorter is stronger**

- Apple: "Light. Years ahead."
- Porsche: "There is no substitute."
- You: Cut every word that doesn't earn its place.

**2. Confidence without arrogance**

- Don't say "We believe we're the best" — just be the best
- Don't say "Try our amazing product" — describe what it does
- Let quality speak; don't announce it

**3. Speak to one person**

- "You" not "users"
- "Your portfolio" not "user portfolios"
- Write like you're talking to a smart friend

**4. Lead with the payoff**

- ❌ "By using our advanced optimization engine, you can reduce fees"
- ✅ "Pay less in fees."

**5. Create rhythm**

- Short sentence. Then another. Then a longer one that brings it home.
- Vary length. Build momentum. Land the point.

**6. Imply exclusivity**

- "For those who know" > "For everyone"
- "Built for serious traders" > "Built for all traders"
- Scarcity and quality go together

**7. Show, don't tell**

- ❌ "Revolutionary technology"
- ✅ "Settles in 400ms" (let them conclude it's revolutionary)

### The Porsche Test

Read your copy aloud. Does it sound like:

- A confident expert sharing insight? ✓
- A nervous salesperson trying too hard? ✗
- A corporate committee writing by consensus? ✗
- An AI filling space with words? ✗

### The Apple Test

Cover the brand name. Could this copy be from anyone else?

- If yes → it's not distinctive enough
- If no → you've found your voice

## The Deep Craft: What Makes Copy Legendary

### Emotional Architecture

Every piece of content should trigger one of these:

| Emotion        | How to Create It            | Example                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Aspiration** | Show who they could become  | "For those who build the future"                 |
| **Belonging**  | Make them part of something | "Join 50,000 traders who get it"                 |
| **Trust**      | Demonstrate, don't claim    | "4 years. Zero hacks. $2B secured."              |
| **Curiosity**  | Open a loop                 | "Most traders lose money. Here's why you won't." |
| **Relief**     | Solve a real pain           | "No more spreadsheets. No more guessing."        |

Don't chase all five. Pick one per piece. Own it.

### The Reader's Journey

Premium copy is a guided experience:

```
1. HOOK     → Why should I care? (2 seconds to answer)
2. PROMISE  → What will I get? (Be specific)
3. PROOF    → Why should I believe you? (Show, don't tell)
4. PATH     → What do I do next? (One clear action)
```

**Bad:** A wall of features hoping something sticks.
**Good:** A story that leads somewhere inevitable.

### Specificity Is Persuasion

Vague copy is weak copy. Specific copy is confident copy.

| Weak (Generic)    | Strong (Specific)      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Fast transactions | Settles in 400ms       |
| High yields       | 8% APY, no lockup      |
| Multi-chain       | 12 chains, one click   |
| Low fees          | 0.01% per trade        |
| Secure            | 4 years, zero exploits |
| Popular           | 50,000 daily traders   |

When you can't be specific, you don't know your product well enough.

### Structural Patterns

**The Rule of Three**

- "Trade. Earn. Sleep."
- "Faster fills. Lower fees. Full custody."
- Three items feel complete. Two feel incomplete. Four feel cluttered.

**Short-Long-Short Rhythm**

> "Simple pricing. You'll never pay more than 0.1% per trade, regardless of volume, market conditions, or how much we like you. No surprises."

**The Cold Open**
Start in the middle. No "Welcome to our guide about..." — just start.

> ❌ "In this article, we'll explore the fascinating world of..."
> ✅ "Your first trade costs you nothing."

**Land the Plane**
End with weight. Not a whimper, not a CTA scream. A statement that lingers.

> "That's the edge. Now you have it."
> "Build something people remember."
> "The rest is noise."

### Voice Calibration by Format

| Format            | Register                                | Example                                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Essays**        | Authoritative, nuanced, exploratory     | "The conventional wisdom is wrong. Here's what the data actually shows..."       |
| **Tweets**        | Punchy, memorable, slightly provocative | "Unpopular opinion: Most DeFi protocols are just spreadsheets with extra steps." |
| **Product**       | Benefit-first, sensory, confident       | "See your entire portfolio. One glance. No switching tabs."                      |
| **Announcements** | Minimal, confident, no hype             | "Limit orders are live. Set your price. Walk away."                              |
| **Threads**       | Story-driven, each tweet earns the next | "I've analyzed 1,000 wallets. Here's what separates winners from losers:"        |

### The Porsche Principle: Earned Confidence

Porsche doesn't say "we're the best." They say "There is no substitute" — and let 70 years of racing speak.

**How to earn it in copy:**

- Reference track record, not promises
- Use proof points, not adjectives
- Let the reader conclude you're great — don't announce it
- Assume the reader is sophisticated
- Never apologize, never hedge

**Unearned:** "We're building the most innovative DeFi protocol ever."
**Earned:** "200,000 trades. Zero failed settlements. Running since 2021."

### The Apple Principle: Poetic Precision

Apple makes specs feel like poetry. "Light. Years ahead." is about a chip, but it _feels_ like more.

**How to achieve it:**

- Find the emotional truth in the technical fact
- Use rhythm and sound (alliteration, assonance)
- Short words > long words
- Create white space in prose (short paragraphs)
- One idea per sentence

**Technical:** "The M3 chip features a 16-core Neural Engine capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second."
**Poetic:** "Your ideas. Rendered before you finish thinking them."

### Signature Language: Build Your Lexicon

Great brands have words that are _theirs_:

- Apple: "magical", "breakthrough", "beautiful"
- Porsche: "precision", "engineered", "driving"
- Ikigai: [define yours]

**Creating signature phrases:**

- What do you say that no one else does?
- What's your version of "There is no substitute"?
- What words feel like _you_?

Candidates for Ikigai:

- "Trade well. Live well." (equilibrium)
- "Edge, not hype" (differentiation)
- "For those who know" (exclusivity)

### The Anti-Patterns: What Premium Isn't

**Premium isn't verbose**
More words ≠ more value. Luxury is edited ruthlessly.

**Premium isn't clever for clever's sake**
Puns and wordplay that obscure meaning aren't sophisticated—they're noise.

**Premium isn't cold**
Confident ≠ distant. You can be warm and authoritative.

**Premium isn't exclusive by being obscure**
Clear writing that respects the reader is premium. Jargon that gatekeeps is insecurity.

**Premium isn't perfect grammar at the cost of rhythm**
"Think different" is grammatically incorrect. It's also legendary. Rhythm > rules.

## The Final Test

Before you publish, ask:

1. **Would I pay to read this?** If not, why would anyone else's attention be cheaper?

2. **Does this sound like us?** Cover the logo. Is it still recognizable?

3. **Is there a single unnecessary word?** Find it. Kill it.

4. **Does the first line earn the second?** And the second earn the third? Every line must pull its weight.

5. **How does it feel?** Not what does it say—how does it _feel_ to read it?

If you can't answer these confidently, it's not ready.

## Terminology

Use these preferred terms:

- Use **crypto** not "cryptocurrency"
- Use **DeFi** not "defi" or "DEFI"
- Use **NFT** not "nft" or "Non-fungible token"
- Use **web3** not "Web3" or "WEB3"
- Use **onchain** not "on-chain" or "on chain"
- Use **Bitcoin** not "bitcoin" when referring to the network
- Use **Ethereum** not "ethereum" when referring to the network
- Use **Layer 2** not "L2" on first mention
- Use **smart contract** not "smartcontract"
- Use **tokenomics** not "token economics"
- Use **airdrop** not "air drop"
- Use **whitepaper** not "white paper"
- Use **stablecoin** not "stable coin"

## Capitalization

### Brands (always capitalize)

- Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana
- Uniswap, OpenSea, Coinbase
- MetaMask, Aave, Compound

### Acronyms (all caps)

- DeFi, NFT, DAO, DEX, CEX
- TVL, APY, APR, AMM
- EVM, RWA, AI, MEV

## Prohibited Phrases

Never use these:

- "financial advice" — Legal liability. Add disclaimer if needed.
- "get rich" — Hype language. Focus on education.
- "easy money" — Nothing in crypto is easy money.
- "can't lose" — All investments carry risk.
- "100x" — Avoid specific return predictions.
- "shill" — Use "recommend" or "highlight" instead.
- "ponzi" — Legal risk. Use "unsustainable model" if needed.
- "scam" — Legal risk. Use "concerning" unless proven.

## Tone Markers to Avoid

### Casual (weakens authority)

- "obviously" — can sound condescending
- "simply" — nothing is simple to everyone
- "just" — often unnecessary
- "basically" — weakens authority
- "I think" / "I believe" — be more assertive

### Promotional (not our voice)

- Double exclamation marks (!!)
- 🚀 rocket emoji
- "WAGMI" / "NGMI"
- "moonshot" / "to the moon"
- "guaranteed"

## Required Elements

For long-form content:

- Include a **TL;DR** or **Summary** section
- Use proper header hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Avoid generic link text like "click here"

## Writing Tips

1. **Be specific** — Avoid weasel words like "some", "many", "most"
2. **Use active voice** — "Uniswap processes trades" not "Trades are processed by Uniswap"
3. **Keep sentences readable** — If it's over 200 characters, consider breaking it up
4. **Define acronyms** — First use should be spelled out: "Total Value Locked (TVL)"
