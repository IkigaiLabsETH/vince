```

**What it tells you:**
- Where returns come from
- Operational efficiency (margin)
- Asset efficiency (turnover)
- Financial leverage

## DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)

### The Formula

```
Intrinsic Value = Σ (CF₁/(1+r)¹) + (CF₂/(1+r)²) + ... + (Terminal/(1+r)ⁿ)
```

**Where:**
- CF = Free Cash Flow
- r = Discount rate (WACC)
- Terminal = Final year × Terminal multiple

---

### Steps

1. **Project FCF** (5-10 years)
2. **Determine WACC** (cost of capital)
3. **Calculate terminal value**
4. **Discount all cash flows**
5. **Sum = Intrinsic Value**

---

## Comparable Analysis

### The Process

1. **Select peer group**
2. **Collect metrics** (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S)
3. **Calculate averages**
4. **Apply to target**
5. **Adjust for differences**

---

### Key Multiples

| Sector | Typical P/E | Typical EV/EBITDA |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Tech | 20-40 | 15-25 |
| Financials | 10-15 | 8-12 |
| Retail | 15-25 | 8-12 |
| Energy | 8-15 | 5-10 |
| Healthcare | 15-30 | 10-18 |
