# Clawterm Vision and Cost Narrative

## Cost Reality

- **Cursor + Claude 4.6:** ~$5K/month in tokens. We grind hard on Cursor with Claude 4.6.
- **OpenClaw on 2 Mac Studios:** $10K each. These machines run OpenClaw 24/7 to expand knowledge and keep grinding when Cursor costs are prohibitive.

## The Choice

There is no choice but to use OpenClaw 24/7. Cursor + Claude is expensive. OpenClaw on Mac Studios picks up the 24/7 expansion so we keep expanding knowledge, keep grinding, and make Clawterm what we believe it could become.

## Vision

**Clawterm = AI meets crypto Bloomberg-style terminal.**

No hype. No shilling. No timing the market. A terminal where AI intelligence meets crypto trading—OpenClaw as the bridge, research agents as the future.
