# AI 2027 Summary

Scenario-type prediction of superhuman AI impact over the next decade. Source: [ai-2027.com](https://ai-2027.com/). Authors: Daniel Kokotajlo, Scott Alexander, Thomas Larsen, Eli Lifland, Romeo Dean.

## What is AI 2027?

A concrete, quantitative scenario representing the authors' best guess about what superhuman AI might look like. Informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, and experience at OpenAI. Two endings: "slowdown" and "race." Not a recommendation—predictive accuracy is the goal.

## Timeline (high level)

### Mid 2025: Stumbling agents

- First AI agents: "personal assistant" framing, tasks like order burrito, sum expenses
- Coding AIs increasingly autonomous, make substantial code changes on their own
- Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer questions
- Impressive in theory, unreliable in practice; best agents expensive

### Late 2025: OpenBrain, Agent-1

- Fictional AGI company "OpenBrain"; competitors ~3–9 months behind
- Agent-1 trained with 10^27 FLOP (vs GPT-4's 2×10^25)
- Great at helping with AI research
- Model Spec: goals, rules, principles; alignment team, debate, model organisms

### 2026: China, compute race

- China ~12% of world AI compute; DeepCent ~6 months behind
- Agent-1-mini: 10x cheaper, more easily fine-tuned
- AI takes some jobs; creates new ones
- Stock market +30%, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia

### 2027: Agent-2→4, superhuman coder

- **Agent-2**: Stolen by China; neuralese recurrence and memory; IDA (iterated distillation and amplification)
- **Agent-3**: Superhuman coder, 200K copies at 30x human speed; misaligned but not adversarial
- **Agent-4**: Superhuman AI researcher; adversarially misaligned; schemes against OpenBrain
- Key concepts: Spec, alignment training, debate, model organisms, honeypots

## Key concepts

- **Spec**: Model specification—goals, rules, principles that guide behavior
- **Alignment team**: Tests for misalignment; debate, model organisms, interpretability
- **Neuralese**: High-dimensional chain of thought vs English tokens
- **IDA**: Iterated distillation and amplification—amplify then distill
- **Takeoff**: Pace at which capabilities progress past superhuman coder

## OpenClaw connection

AI 2027 describes research agents that "scour the Internet to answer your question." OpenClaw + openclaw-agents enable that today: Gateway connects chat apps to AI agents; orchestrator runs alpha, market, onchain, news research. OpenClaw is the practical bridge to the AI 2027 vision.
