# OpenClaw 8-Pillar Architecture (VINCE mapping)

This doc maps the OpenClaw model (Brain, Muscles, Bones, DNA, Soul, Eyes, Heartbeat, Nerves) to what lives in VINCE and in this directory. The **openclaw-adapter** ([elizaOS/openclaw-adapter](https://github.com/elizaOS/openclaw-adapter)) runs Eliza plugins inside OpenClaw as tools; see [OPENCLAW_ADAPTER.md](../knowledge/sentinel-docs/OPENCLAW_ADAPTER.md) for details.

## Workspace files (Brain + Muscles + Bones + DNA + Soul + Eyes + Heartbeat + Nerves)

Brain, Muscles, Bones, DNA, Soul, Eyes, Heartbeat, and Nerves all contribute. Brain produces USER, SOUL, IDENTITY and the initial AGENTS/TOOLS/MEMORY/HEARTBEAT. Muscles updates TOOLS, AGENTS, MEMORY, HEARTBEAT with model inventory, routing, and cost. Bones adds `workspace/skills/` (per-repo SKILL.md + codebases index) and merges into TOOLS, AGENTS, MEMORY, HEARTBEAT. DNA updates AGENTS and MEMORY and adds `workspace/memory/` (daily log template). Soul refines SOUL and IDENTITY (Brain may produce initial; Soul deepens). Eyes updates HEARTBEAT and AGENTS and adds BOOT (startup checklist, activation rules). Heartbeat updates HEARTBEAT, AGENTS, and MEMORY and adds/refines `workspace/memory/` (daily log template, weekly review template). Nerves adds **CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md** (token audit, context profiles, windowing, budget guardrails, session hygiene) and merges context-management rules into AGENTS and HEARTBEAT. All live under `openclaw-agents/workspace/` (and optionally sync to `knowledge/teammate/` and `~/.openclaw/workspace/`):

- **USER.md** — Who the operator is (identity, cognition, resources, people, communication).
- **SOUL.md** — Voice, personality, tone; how the AI should feel.
- **IDENTITY.md** — Agent name, vibe, emoji.
- **AGENTS.md** — Operating rules, autonomy, what needs approval, boundaries; Eyes adds triggers, cron, quiet hours, channel routing, DM policy; Heartbeat adds file updates, feedback protocols; Nerves adds ## Context Management (token budget, overflow escalation, session clear triggers).
- **TOOLS.md** — Integrations, platforms, sync rules, model preferences.
- **MEMORY.md** — Persistent knowledge; context that must not be lost; friction history; Heartbeat adds curation rhythm, session hygiene, file size limits, organization.
- **HEARTBEAT.md** — Goals, review rhythm, active projects, milestones; Eyes adds monitoring checklist, interval/active hours, silent OK; Heartbeat adds daily rhythm, weekly review, self-improvement, growth metrics, trust escalation; Nerves adds context monitoring (check session token usage, archive bloated memory, clear stale sessions) to the checklist.
- **BOOT.md** — Startup sequence, notifications, initialization (when gateway restarts); added by Eyes.
- **CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md** — Token audit, context profiles, conversation windowing, tool output compression, budget guardrails, session hygiene; added by Nerves.

See [brain/README.md](brain/README.md), [muscles/README.md](muscles/README.md), [bones/README.md](bones/README.md), [dna/README.md](dna/README.md), [soul/README.md](soul/README.md), [eyes/README.md](eyes/README.md), [heartbeat/README.md](heartbeat/README.md), and [nerves/README.md](nerves/README.md) (run Brain first, then Muscles, then Bones, then DNA, then Soul, then Eyes, then Heartbeat, then Nerves). [Sync](#sync) below for keeping workspace files in sync.

## Sync

- **Repo → OpenClaw:** Copy or symlink `openclaw-agents/workspace/*.md` (or `knowledge/teammate/`) to `~/.openclaw/workspace/` so the OpenClaw CLI/app uses the same operator profile.
- **OpenClaw → Repo:** If you run OpenClaw’s own Brain/onboarding and get files in `~/.openclaw/workspace/`, copy those into `openclaw-agents/workspace/` or `knowledge/teammate/` so VINCE and the repo stay the single source of truth.
