## Account Analysis Framework

For each tracked account, ECHO should maintain running scores on:

| Metric | Description | Update Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Sentiment alignment | Does this account lead or lag market moves? | Weekly |
| Call accuracy | % of directional calls that were correct within stated timeframe | Monthly |
| Engagement velocity | Time from post to 1K likes (normalized by follower count) | Per post |
| Whale vs retail audience | Estimated Premium subscriber % in replies | Monthly |
| Contrarian indicator score | Correlation between max conviction posts and subsequent reversals | Monthly |

### Scoring Notes

- Tier 1 accounts with >60% call accuracy get 3x sentiment weight
- Tier 4 accounts with contrarian indicator score >0.7 get inverse sentiment weight
- Engagement velocity dropping >50% from 30-day average = account losing relevance
- New accounts entering any tier need 90 days of tracking before weighting

---

## Red Flags — Accounts to Discount

Automatic weight reduction triggers:

1. **Follower spike >20% in 7 days** without corresponding viral event — likely bought followers
2. **GM-only accounts** — if >50% of posts are "gm" or engagement farming with no analysis, weight = 0
3. **Pump-only posting** — accounts that go silent during drawdowns and reappear during pumps are lagging indicators at best
4. **Paid promotions without disclosure** — if caught once, permanent 50% weight reduction
5. **Engagement pod participation** — coordinated likes/retweets within first 60 seconds of posting. Detectable by reply timestamp clustering
6. **Deleted post pattern** — accounts that delete wrong calls and keep winners. Track deletion rate.

## ECHO Usage Notes

### Weighted Sentiment Scoring

ECHO should compute sentiment scores using tiered weights:

| Tier | Base Weight | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | 5.0 | Whale/market mover posts |
| 2 | 3.0 | Alpha/analysis posts |
| 3 | 2.0 | News (speed-weighted, not opinion) |
| 4 | 1.0 (or -1.0 inverse) | Sentiment indicators |
| 5 | 4.0 (Elon only), 1.0 (others) | Platform/ecosystem |

### Sentiment Calculation

```
weighted_sentiment = Σ (account_tier_weight × account_accuracy_modifier × post_sentiment_score)
```

Where:
- `post_sentiment_score` ranges from -1.0 (max bearish) to +1.0 (max bullish)
- `account_accuracy_modifier` = rolling 90-day call accuracy (0.0 to 1.5)
- Tier 4 accounts with contrarian score >0.7: invert their sentiment contribution

### Priority Rules

1. **Tier 1 divergence from Tier 4** = high-conviction signal. Whales bearish while retail euphoric = distribution phase.
2. **Tier 3 speed** matters more than sentiment. A news account posting about an exploit is a data point, not an opinion.
3. **Tier 5 (Elon) posts** about DOGE or crypto: treat as direct catalyst, not sentiment. Execute on speed, not analysis.
4. **Cross-tier convergence** (all tiers aligning bullish/bearish) = trend confirmation. Low alpha but high confidence.
5. **Tier 1 silence** during volatility = they're positioned and waiting. Track posting frequency drops as signals.

### Update Cadence

- Refresh follower counts and accuracy scores: monthly
- Add/remove accounts: quarterly review
- Red flag checks: weekly automated scan
- Full watchlist audit: every market cycle shift (detect via 200-day MA cross)
