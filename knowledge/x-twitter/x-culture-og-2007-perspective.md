# X/Twitter Culture — The OG 2007 Perspective

> For ECHO: Understanding what the platform was vs what it became. This is institutional memory that most current CT users don't have.

## The 2007 Experience

### What It Felt Like

You signed up and got a blank page with one question: "What are you doing?" That was it. No algorithm, no "For You" feed, no promoted content. Pure reverse-chronological timeline of people you chose to follow.

The 140-character limit came from SMS constraints — Twitter was designed to work via text message. This forced compression: you had to be concise or get creative. The constraint made the platform. Every character mattered.

### Organic Reach Was Real

In 2007-2010, if you wrote something good, it spread. No algo gating, no pay-to-play. A solid post could reach thousands organically because people actually read their timelines. Retweets were manual ("RT @username: their tweet") before Twitter built the feature natively in 2009.

Hashtags didn't exist until Chris Messina proposed them in August 2007. Users invented the entire @reply convention. The community built the grammar of the platform before the company codified it. This matters: Twitter's best features came from users, not product managers.

### Building Real Audiences

Pre-algorithm, audience building was straightforward:
- Write consistently good content
- Engage genuinely with others
- Get retweeted by larger accounts
- Show up during events (SXSW, conferences, breaking news)

No engagement pods. No "gm" culture. No raid groups. Your content either resonated or it didn't. The feedback loop was honest.

### The Community Was Small Enough to Be Real

In 2007, the entire platform had ~500K users. By 2009, ~50M. You could actually know the "famous" people on the platform. @jack replied to people. @ev had conversations. It felt like a neighborhood, not a stadium.

Early adopters included:
- Tech founders and VCs (before everyone had a "personal brand")
- Journalists who needed speed
- Comedians testing material in real-time
- Political activists (Iran 2009 was the first "Twitter revolution")
- Bloggers extending their reach

The culture was **curious, nerdy, and collaborative**. Not performative.

## The Shift: How It Changed

### Phase 1: Celebrity Invasion (2009-2012)

Ashton Kutcher vs CNN race to 1M followers (Apr 2009) marked the turning point. Celebrities discovered Twitter. The culture shifted from conversations to broadcasting. Follower counts started mattering more than engagement quality.

### Phase 2: The Algorithm Arrives (2016-2017)

Twitter introduced algorithmic timeline ranking in February 2016. Users revolted (#RIPTwitter trended). But the algo stayed. This was the fundamental break from the OG experience:
- Your timeline was no longer yours
- Twitter decided what you saw
- Engagement bait started outperforming substance
- The chronological timeline became opt-in (buried in settings)

### Phase 3: Culture Wars (2017-2021)

Trump's presidency turned Twitter into a political battlefield. The platform's culture shifted:
- Dunking > discussing
- Quote-tweet ratio culture
- Pile-ons and cancellation campaigns
- Content moderation became the central debate
- "Main character of the day" phenomenon

### Phase 4: Musk Era (2022-Present)

The acquisition accelerated every trend the algo was already encouraging:
- Pay-to-play verification destroyed trust signals
- Premium users' content boosted regardless of quality
- Creator monetization incentivized outrage (payouts tied to Premium user engagement)
- External links penalized — the platform wants to keep you inside
- Musk's own posts force-fed into everyone's "For You" feed

## What OGs Lost

### The Chronological Timeline
You could open Twitter, scroll for 10 minutes, and know you'd seen everything important from people you followed. Now you get an algorithmic soup designed to maximize engagement (read: outrage).

### Organic Discovery
Good content used to find its audience naturally. Now reach is gated behind Premium subscriptions, engagement velocity in the first 30 minutes, and whether the algo decides your post "deserves" distribution.

### Trust in Verification
The blue checkmark used to mean "this person is who they claim to be." Now it means "this person pays $8/month." This destroyed a core trust layer of the platform. During breaking news, you can't quickly distinguish verified journalists from random Premium subscribers.

### The API Ecosystem
Pre-Musk, a thriving ecosystem of third-party apps (Tweetbot, Twitterrific, Tweetdeck alternatives), research tools, and bots made the platform richer. Musk's API pricing ($5K-$42K+/mo for meaningful access) killed most of it overnight. This also devastated academic research and independent sentiment analysis.

### Chronological Search
Twitter search was always the platform's underrated superpower: real-time search of what the world was talking about. It still works but is increasingly polluted by Premium-boosted engagement bait.

## What OGs Gained (Or at Least, What Changed for the Better)

### Longer Posts
The shift from 140 → 280 → 25,000 characters lets people actually explain complex ideas without thread gymnastics. For deep CT analysis, this is genuinely useful.

### Community Notes
Crowdsourced fact-checking that actually works better than corporate moderation in many cases. When a CT shill posts misleading tokenomics, Community Notes can correct it in real-time.

### Reduced Political Censorship
Whatever you think of the moderation shift, crypto content is treated more neutrally than it was under the old regime. No more shadow-banning of DeFi discussions or flagging NFT content.

### Creator Monetization (Double-Edged)
OGs with large, engaged audiences can now earn directly from their content. The downside: the incentive structure rewards engagement farming over quality.

## The Algo vs The OG: A Practical Guide

### How the 2007 User Experiences X in 2026

| Then (2007) | Now (2026) |
|---|---|
| Open app, see chronological feed | Open app, see algorithmic "For You" |
| 140 chars, every word counts | 25,000 chars, threads rewarded for length |
| Blue check = verified identity | Blue check = $8/month subscription |
| Reach earned by quality | Reach bought/gamed by algo mechanics |
| RT = manual endorsement | Repost = one-click, often reflexive |
| No ads in timeline | Ads + promoted posts + Premium boosts |
| Free API, rich ecosystem | API paywalled, ecosystem gutted |
| ~500K users, real community | ~500M+ MAU, anonymous mass |

### What This Means for ECHO

When ECHO reads X sentiment, it's reading through multiple distortion layers:
1. **Algorithm bias**: Premium users' posts are amplified 2-4x, skewing visible sentiment
2. **Monetization incentive**: The loudest, most extreme takes get the most engagement (and payouts)
3. **Bot pollution**: Despite Musk's promises, bot activity remains significant
4. **Survivorship bias**: OG quality accounts that didn't adapt to the new algo have less reach
5. **Engagement ≠ conviction**: A post with 10K likes might be algorithmed into people's feeds; it doesn't mean 10K people sought it out

ECHO should weight:
- **Account age** (pre-2015 accounts are more likely authentic OGs)
- **Follower-to-engagement ratio** (natural engagement vs algo-boosted)
- **Non-Premium accounts' sentiment** (less distorted by incentives)
- **Quote-tweet ratio** (ratio'd posts signal community disagreement regardless of like count)
- **Reply quality** over reply quantity

## Key Cultural Terms ECHO Should Know

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **CT** | Crypto Twitter — the crypto-focused community on X |
| **Ratio** | When replies/quotes far exceed likes — signals disagreement |
| **Main character** | Person who becomes the center of X drama for a day |
| **Thread** | Multi-post chain used for long-form content |
| **QT** | Quote tweet — reposting with commentary |
| **GM** | "Good morning" — crypto culture greeting, sometimes sincere, often engagement farming |
| **WAGMI/NGMI** | "We're all gonna make it" / "Not gonna make it" |
| **Raid** | Coordinated group engagement campaign |
| **Shill** | Promoting a token, often with financial incentive |

| **DYOR** | "Do your own research" — disclaimer, sometimes genuine, sometimes defensive |
| **Based** | Holding an opinion confidently regardless of popularity |
| **Cope** | Rationalizing a bad position or loss |
| **Hopium** | Unfounded optimism about price |
| **Bearposting** | Deliberately pessimistic content, often for engagement |

## The 2007 Account Advantage

For Yves's account specifically, having a 2007 join date signals:
- **OG credibility**: Pre-algorithm, pre-monetization, pre-everything era
- **18+ years on platform**: Longer than most current CT accounts have existed
- **Institutional memory**: Remembers when the platform worked differently
- **Natural audience building**: Any following was built the hard way, not bought

This is rare. Most active CT accounts were created 2017-2021 during crypto bull runs. A 2007 account that's still active carries weight in CT circles — it signals staying power and conviction that transcends market cycles.
