# Geopolitics, Macro Economics & Market Impact

Reference document for ECHO (Chief Sentiment Officer). How the real world moves prices.

---

## 1. US Monetary Policy & The Fed

The Federal Reserve is the single most powerful institution affecting risk asset prices globally.
Every other macro factor ultimately flows through or reacts to Fed policy.

### The Dual Mandate

The Fed has two jobs mandated by Congress:
1. **Maximum employment** — keep unemployment low
2. **Price stability** — target 2% annual inflation (measured by PCE)

These two goals often conflict. High employment can drive inflation up. Killing inflation
often requires killing jobs. The Fed's balancing act between these two is the core driver
of monetary policy.

### Fed Funds Rate

The federal funds rate is the overnight lending rate between banks. It is the single most
important variable for all risk assets on earth.

- **Rate hikes** = borrowing costs rise → less leverage → less speculation → risk assets dump.
  Crypto gets hit hardest because it's the furthest out on the risk curve.
- **Rate cuts** = borrowing costs fall → more leverage → more speculation → risk-on.
  Crypto rallies hard because it's the most reflexive risk asset.
- **Rate pause** = market prices in the next move. "Higher for longer" rhetoric alone can
  suppress prices even without actual hikes.

The rate was near zero (0-0.25%) from March 2020 through early 2022. Then the fastest
hiking cycle in 40 years took it to 5.25-5.50% by July 2023. Cuts began September 2024.

### Quantitative Easing (QE)

QE = the Fed buys Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities with newly created money.

- Increases the money supply
- Pushes down long-term interest rates
- Forces investors into riskier assets (stocks, crypto) seeking yield
- March 2020: Fed launched unlimited QE. BTC went from $3,800 to $69,000 in 20 months.
- QE is the most direct "money printer" mechanism. When it's on, risk assets go up. Period.

### Quantitative Tightening (QT)

QT = the Fed lets bonds mature without reinvesting, shrinking its balance sheet.

- Drains liquidity from the financial system
- Started June 2022 at $95B/month runoff
- Slowed to $60B/month in mid-2024, then further reduced
- QT is a slow background drain. It doesn't crash markets like rate hikes, but it
  creates a persistent headwind for risk assets.
- The Fed's balance sheet peaked at ~$9T. QT has been slowly bringing it down.

### FOMC Meetings

The Federal Open Market Committee meets 8 times per year. These are the most important
dates on the financial calendar.

- Rate decisions are announced at 2:00 PM ET
- Press conference with the Chair follows at 2:30 PM ET
- Markets reprice in minutes — sometimes seconds
- The statement language matters enormously. Single word changes ("some" vs "modest"
  further progress) move billions
- Between meetings, Fed speakers give speeches that serve as unofficial guidance

**2025 FOMC dates:** Jan 28-29, Mar 18-19, May 6-7, Jun 17-18, Jul 29-30, Sep 16-17,
Oct 28-29, Dec 9-10.

### The Dot Plot

Released quarterly (March, June, September, December meetings). Each Fed member plots
where they expect rates to be at year-end for the next few years.

- The median dot is what markets focus on
- Shifts in the dot plot can move markets more than actual rate decisions
- December 2024 dot plot showed fewer cuts expected in 2025 → markets sold off hard

### Jackson Hole Economic Symposium

Annual Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, every August. The Chair gives a keynote
speech that often signals major policy shifts.

- August 2020: Powell announced "average inflation targeting" — huge policy shift
- August 2022: Powell's "pain" speech signaled aggressive hikes → markets dumped
- The speech is typically on a Friday morning. Markets react immediately.

### Key People at the Fed

- **Jerome Powell** (Chair): The most important person in finance. Reappointed 2022,
  term expires 2026. His press conferences move markets with every sentence.
- **Christopher Waller** (Governor): Influential hawk-turned-dove. His speeches on
  rate cuts in late 2023 helped spark the rally.
- **Mary Daly** (SF Fed President): Voting member, generally moderate.
- **Neel Kashkari** (Minneapolis Fed): Known for hawkish rhetoric, vocal on X.
- **John Williams** (NY Fed President): Permanent voting member, runs the trading desk.

### Key X Accounts for Fed Watching

- **@NickTimiraos** — WSJ's Fed reporter. Effectively the Fed's unofficial mouthpiece.
  When Nick tweets a story, it's often a deliberate Fed leak. His articles frequently
  move markets as much as actual Fed statements. Must-follow.
- **@FedGuy12** — Joseph Wang, former senior trader at the NY Fed's open market desk.
  Explains plumbing (repo, reserves, QT mechanics) better than anyone. His blog
  "Fed Guy" is essential reading.
- **@DiMartinoBooth** — Danielle DiMartino Booth, former Dallas Fed advisor. Sharp
  critic of Fed policy. Good for contrarian takes and real economy data.
- **@michaelsbarr** — (former) Fed Vice Chair for Supervision. Banking regulation angle.

---

## 2. US Treasury & Fiscal Policy

The Treasury Department manages US government debt and spending. Its operations directly
affect market liquidity — sometimes more than the Fed.

### Treasury Secretary

- **Janet Yellen** served as Treasury Secretary 2021-2025. Former Fed Chair.
  Known for strategically shifting Treasury issuance to shorter maturities (T-bills)
  in late 2023, which drained the Reverse Repo Facility and effectively injected
  liquidity — a stealth stimulus that helped fuel the 2023-2024 rally.
- **Scott Bessent** became Treasury Secretary in January 2025 under Trump.
  Hedge fund manager (Soros Fund background). Market-savvy, understands the
  plumbing. His approach to debt management and issuance matters enormously.

### Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA)

Every quarter, the Treasury announces how much debt it will issue and in what maturities.

- Announced on the Wednesday of the first full week of February, May, August, November
- More long-term issuance (10Y, 30Y bonds) = higher yields = tighter conditions = bearish
- More short-term issuance (T-bills) = absorbed by money market funds = less impact on yields
- The QRA in November 2023 was a turning point — less long-term issuance than feared
  triggered a massive bond and stock rally

### Treasury General Account (TGA)

The TGA is the government's checking account at the Fed.

- **TGA draining** (government spending down its balance): Liquidity enters the system → bullish
- **TGA filling** (tax receipts, new debt issuance): Liquidity leaves the system → bearish
- After debt ceiling resolutions, the Treasury rebuilds the TGA by issuing tons of debt,
  which sucks liquidity out of markets
- Tax season (April) fills the TGA → seasonal liquidity drain

### Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)

The Fed's overnight reverse repo facility became a massive liquidity buffer.

- Peaked at ~$2.5T in late 2022
- Drained steadily through 2023-2024 as money market funds shifted to T-bills
- This drainage was a hidden liquidity injection that helped risk assets
- When RRP hits zero, the next source of liquidity has to come from somewhere else
  (bank reserves, QE, etc.)
- By early 2025, RRP was largely depleted

### US National Debt

- Over $36 trillion and growing by ~$1T every 100 days
- Interest payments on the debt exceeded $1T annually in 2024
- Debt ceiling fights create artificial crises — threat of US default
- When the ceiling is hit, Treasury uses "extraordinary measures" to keep paying bills
- Resolution always involves a flood of new issuance → TGA rebuild → liquidity drain
- The 2023 debt ceiling fight (resolved June 2023) caused significant market anxiety

### Big Beautiful Bill (2025)

Trump's major fiscal package in 2025. Extended tax cuts, new spending provisions.

- Caused a public feud between Musk and Trump over spending levels
- Musk's DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) wanted cuts; the bill expanded spending
- Market impact: uncertainty about the Musk-Trump alliance rattled tech and crypto
- Fiscal expansion = more debt issuance = potentially higher yields = mixed for risk assets

### Tax Policy & Crypto

- Capital gains tax rates directly affect trading behavior
- Proposals to tax unrealized gains → sell-offs on announcement
- Wash sale rules don't currently apply to crypto (unlike stocks) — this is a trading advantage
- Tax loss harvesting season (December) creates predictable selling pressure
- Any proposal to change crypto tax treatment moves markets

### Key X Accounts for Treasury & Fiscal

- **@LukeGromen** — Macro strategist focused on sovereign debt, energy, and gold.
  Thesis: US debt is unsustainable → eventual monetization → bullish hard assets.
- **@SantiagoAuFund** — Gold and macro fund. Sovereign debt angle.
- **@JeffSnider_AIP** — Eurodollar system expert. Deep plumbing analysis. Contrarian.
  Often argues the Fed is less powerful than people think.
- **@MacroAlf** — Alfonso Peccatiello. Former head of fixed income at ING.
  Clear macro analysis, good charts, explains bond markets accessibly.

## 3. Global Central Banks & Foreign Exchange

The Fed doesn't operate in a vacuum. Other central banks and currency movements create
cross-border flows that hit crypto hard.

### European Central Bank (ECB)

- **Christine Lagarde** (President): Former IMF head. Not an economist by training.
- ECB manages rates for the entire Eurozone (20 countries)
- EUR/USD is the most traded currency pair in the world
- When ECB is more hawkish than the Fed → EUR strengthens → DXY weakens → crypto benefits
- When ECB is dovish relative to Fed → EUR weakens → DXY rises → crypto headwind
- European banking stress (Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse in 2023) creates global risk-off

### Bank of Japan (BOJ)

The BOJ is arguably the second most important central bank for crypto after the Fed.

**The Yen Carry Trade:**
- For decades, Japan had near-zero or negative interest rates
- Traders borrow yen cheaply, convert to dollars, buy higher-yielding assets (including crypto)
- This creates massive leveraged positions globally
- When BOJ raises rates or yen strengthens → carry trade unwinds → forced selling everywhere

**August 2024 crash:**
- BOJ raised rates on July 31, 2024
- Yen strengthened sharply
- Carry trade unwind triggered global sell-off
- BTC dropped from ~$66K to ~$49K in days
- Nikkei had its worst day since 1987 (-12.4%)
- The move was amplified by thin summer liquidity

**Governor Kazuo Ueda** replaced Haruhiko Kuroda in 2023. More willing to normalize policy
than his predecessor, making BOJ a persistent risk factor.

### People's Bank of China (PBOC)

- Controls the yuan (CNY/CNH) exchange rate
- Yuan devaluation → Chinese capital flight → some flows into BTC as a way to move
  money out of China
- 2015 yuan devaluation correlated with early BTC interest in China
- China banned crypto trading and mining (2021), but OTC markets still exist
- PBOC stimulus measures (rate cuts, RRR cuts) affect global risk sentiment
- Chinese property crisis (Evergrande, Country Garden) → deflationary fears → risk-off

### Bank of England (BOE)

- **UK Gilt Crisis (September 2022):** Liz Truss government announced unfunded tax cuts.
  UK bond market collapsed. BOE had to do emergency QE to prevent pension fund blowups.
  This showed how quickly bond markets can break things — and how central banks will
  always step in to prevent systemic collapse (which is ultimately bullish for hard assets).
- UK rates track similar trajectory to Fed but with UK-specific inflation dynamics
- Less direct crypto impact than Fed/BOJ, but gilt crisis was a warning shot

### DXY (US Dollar Index)

The DXY measures the dollar against a basket of 6 currencies (EUR 57.6%, JPY 13.6%,
GBP 11.9%, CAD 9.1%, SEK 4.2%, CHF 3.6%).

- **Strong dollar (DXY up) = bearish for crypto and commodities.** Dollar strength
  tightens global financial conditions because most global debt is denominated in dollars.
- **Weak dollar (DXY down) = bullish for crypto and commodities.** Eases global conditions.
- DXY peaked at ~114 in September 2022 (crypto bottom was November 2022)
- BTC and DXY have a strong inverse correlation over medium-term timeframes
- Watch for DXY breaking key levels (100, 105, 110) — these trigger momentum moves

### Key X Accounts for Global Macro & FX

- **@AndreasSteno** — Andreas Steno Larsen. European macro analysis. Good on EUR rates,
  energy, and global liquidity.
- **@WuBlockchain** — Colin Wu. Best English-language source for Chinese crypto news
  and PBOC policy impact.
- **@dampedspring** — Andy Constan. Former Bridgewater. Deep macro, options, volatility.

## 4. Geopolitical Hotspots That Move Markets

### Russia-Ukraine War (2022-ongoing)

**Initial shock (February 24, 2022):**
- Russia invaded Ukraine. Global markets crashed.
- BTC dropped from ~$38K to ~$34K on invasion day, continued lower
- European equities cratered on energy dependency fears

**Energy crisis:**
- Russia supplied ~40% of Europe's natural gas
- Nord Stream pipeline cuts → European gas prices went from ~€20/MWh to €340/MWh
- Energy inflation cascaded into everything: food, manufacturing, transport
- Forced ECB into aggressive rate hikes despite weak European economy

**Sanctions and financial warfare:**
- Russia cut from SWIFT (except energy payments)
- Russian central bank reserves frozen (~$300B)
- Oil price caps imposed by G7
- This demonstrated that the dollar-based financial system can be weaponized
- Accelerated interest in BTC as "sanctions-resistant" money (narrative, not necessarily reality)

**Ongoing market impact:**
- Nuclear escalation rhetoric → risk-off events (flash crashes)
- Grain export disruptions → food inflation globally
- Musk/Starlink involvement adds a tech-billionaire angle to the conflict
- Ceasefire or peace deal speculation → risk-on rallies
- Escalation → risk-off, safe haven flows (gold, USD, sometimes BTC)

### China-Taiwan

**Why it matters for markets:**
- TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor) produces ~90% of the world's most advanced chips
- Every AI chip (NVIDIA, AMD, Apple) is manufactured in Taiwan
- A military conflict would collapse the global tech supply chain overnight
- This is not a gradual risk — it's binary. Peace = fine. War = catastrophe.

**Market reactions to tensions:**
- China military exercises near Taiwan → NVDA, TSM sell-off
- Pelosi's Taiwan visit (August 2022) → China launched military exercises → temporary sell-off
- Any US arms sales to Taiwan → Chinese retaliation threats → market nervousness
- Semiconductor stocks are the direct transmission mechanism

**How ECHO should read this:**
- Watch for PLA (People's Liberation Army) activity near Taiwan Strait
- Monitor Chinese state media escalation language
- US Navy movements in the Pacific
- This is the single largest tail risk for global markets

### Middle East (Israel-Gaza-Iran)

**October 7, 2023:**
- Hamas attacked Israel. Oil spiked on fear of regional escalation.
- BTC initially dipped, then recovered as conflict stayed contained
- Gold caught a safe haven bid

**Iran-Israel direct confrontation:**
- April 2024: Iran launched 300+ drones/missiles at Israel (first direct attack)
  → BTC dropped ~8% overnight
- October 2024: Israel struck Iran → escalation fears
- Each escalation round → oil spike → inflation fears → rate cut repricing → risk-off

**Houthi Red Sea disruption (late 2023-2024):**
- Yemen's Houthis attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea
- Forced ships to reroute around Africa → longer transit times → higher shipping costs
- Supply chain inflation echoes — exactly what markets didn't need
- Shipping cost spikes → CPI pressure → Fed stays hawkish longer

**The oil → inflation → Fed → crypto chain:**
Oil price up → energy inflation → CPI higher → Fed stays hawkish → rates higher longer →
dollar stronger → crypto bearish. This is the primary transmission mechanism from
Middle East geopolitics to crypto prices.

### US-China Trade War

**Tariff history:**
- Trump 1.0 (2018-2020): Tariffs on $370B of Chinese goods, up to 25%
- Biden kept most tariffs, added chip export controls
- Trump 2.0 (2025): Restarted and expanded tariffs. New rounds announced via Truth Social/X.

**Tech decoupling:**
- US chip export controls (October 2022): Banned sales of advanced AI chips to China
- NVIDIA had to create handicapped chips for Chinese market
- TikTok ban attempts → tech regulation uncertainty
- China developing domestic chip industry → long-term competition

**Market impact:**
- Tariff announcements → immediate sell-offs in exposed sectors
- Semiconductor stocks swing on every new export control rumor
- Emerging market currencies and equities take collateral damage
- Supply chain reshoring themes (Mexico, Vietnam, India) = new investment narratives

### Trump Second Term (2025-present)

**Tariff policy via social media:**
- Trump announces tariffs on Truth Social and X, sometimes late at night
- Markets react in real-time to his posts. This is unprecedented.
- Creates flash volatility that algorithmic traders exploit
- ECHO must monitor Trump's social accounts for tariff-related posts

**DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency):**
- Musk-led initiative to cut government spending
- Federal employee layoffs → economic uncertainty
- Government shutdown fears → market volatility
- Musk-Trump alliance became a feud in 2025 over spending priorities
- This relationship dynamic directly affects Tesla stock and crypto sentiment

**Pro-crypto executive orders:**
- January 2025: Executive order exploring a Bitcoin strategic reserve
- Signaled a dramatic shift from Biden-era crypto hostility
- BTC rallied on the announcement
- SEC leadership change: Paul Atkins nominated (crypto-friendly) replacing Gary Gensler
- Regulatory clarity = institutional adoption = structurally bullish medium-term

**Key dynamic:** Trump's policy-by-tweet style means macro events can happen at any hour.
Traditional market hours don't contain the volatility — crypto, trading 24/7, reacts first.

## 5. Macro Indicators ECHO Should Track

### Monthly Reports

| Indicator | Release | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **CPI** (Consumer Price Index) | ~13th of month, 8:30 AM ET | Main inflation gauge. Core CPI (ex food/energy) is what the Fed watches. Hot CPI = hawkish Fed = bearish. Cool CPI = dovish Fed = bullish. |
| **PPI** (Producer Price Index) | Day after or before CPI | Leading indicator for CPI. Producer costs flow through to consumer prices. |
| **NFP** (Non-Farm Payrolls) | First Friday of month, 8:30 AM ET | Jobs report. Strong jobs = economy hot = Fed stays hawkish. Weak jobs = recession fear but also rate cut hope. The unemployment rate and wage growth numbers matter as much as the headline. |
| **PCE** (Personal Consumption Expenditures) | Last week of month | The Fed's PREFERRED inflation metric. Core PCE is what they actually target at 2%. Often overshadowed by CPI but technically more important. |
| **ISM Manufacturing** | First business day of month | Above 50 = expansion, below 50 = contraction. Leading indicator for economic activity. |
| **ISM Services** | Third business day of month | Services are 70%+ of US economy. The prices-paid component is an inflation signal. |
| **Michigan Consumer Sentiment** | Preliminary mid-month, final end of month | Retail sentiment and inflation expectations. The 1-year and 5-year inflation expectations components move markets. |

### Quarterly Reports

| Indicator | Release | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **GDP** | End of month following quarter-end (advance, second, third estimates) | Overall economic growth. Negative GDP = recession narrative. Strong GDP = soft landing narrative. |
| **Earnings Season** | ~2 weeks after quarter-end | Not a government stat, but mega-cap tech earnings (NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META, TSLA) move the entire market. AI spending numbers from cloud companies affect the whole tech narrative. |

### Weekly Data

| Indicator | Release | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial Jobless Claims** | Every Thursday, 8:30 AM ET | Most real-time labor market data available. Rising claims = weakening economy. |
| **Continuing Claims** | Same release | Shows how long people stay unemployed. Rising = harder to find jobs. |

### Real-Time Indicators

| Indicator | Where to Watch | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **VIX** (Volatility Index) | CBOE | The "fear gauge." Measures expected S&P 500 volatility. VIX > 30 = panic. VIX > 40 = crisis. Spikes = risk-off across all assets including crypto. |
| **DXY** (Dollar Index) | ICE | Dollar strength. Inverse correlation with crypto. Break above 105 = headwind. Break below 100 = tailwind. |
| **10-Year Treasury Yield** | Treasury market | The risk-free rate. Higher 10Y = higher discount rate for all assets = stocks and crypto worth less in present value terms. 10Y above 5% is a danger zone. |
| **2Y-10Y Spread** | Treasury market | Yield curve. When 2Y yield > 10Y yield = inversion = recession signal. The UN-inversion (normalization) often happens right before the recession actually hits. |
| **Fed Funds Futures** | CME FedWatch Tool | Shows market-implied probability of rate changes at each FOMC meeting. When this shifts, everything shifts. |
| **Bitcoin ETF Flows** | Multiple trackers | Daily net inflows/outflows from spot BTC ETFs. Sustained outflows = institutional selling. Sustained inflows = institutional buying. |

## 6. Macro → Crypto Transmission Mechanism

### The Liquidity Channel

This is the primary mechanism:

```
Fed cuts rates → Treasury yields fall → Dollar weakens (DXY down)
→ Global financial conditions ease → Leverage increases
→ Risk appetite grows → Capital flows to risk curve extremes
→ Crypto rallies (hardest and fastest)
```

The reverse:

```
Fed hikes rates → Treasury yields rise → Dollar strengthens (DXY up)
→ Global financial conditions tighten → Leverage decreases
→ Risk appetite shrinks → Capital flees risk curve extremes first
→ Crypto dumps (hardest and fastest)
```

Crypto is at the far end of the risk curve. It moves first on liquidity changes and
moves the most. This is why BTC is sometimes called a "liquidity barometer."

### Global M2 Money Supply

- BTC price correlates with global M2 (total money supply across all major economies)
  on approximately a 10-12 week lag
- This is the Raoul Pal / Michael Howell thesis
- When global M2 expands → BTC follows ~3 months later
- When global M2 contracts → BTC follows down ~3 months later
- Not perfect, but the correlation has held across multiple cycles
- Global M2 includes Fed, ECB, BOJ, PBOC, BOE money creation

### Bitcoin Halving Cycle

Every ~210,000 blocks (~4 years), the Bitcoin block reward halves:
- 2012: 50 → 25 BTC
- 2016: 25 → 12.5 BTC
- 2020: 12.5 → 6.25 BTC
- **2024: 6.25 → 3.125 BTC (April 20, 2024)**

Historical pattern: new all-time high 12-18 months after halving.
- 2012 halving → ATH ~$1,100 (Nov 2013)
- 2016 halving → ATH ~$20,000 (Dec 2017)
- 2020 halving → ATH ~$69,000 (Nov 2021)
- 2024 halving → ? (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026 if pattern holds)

The halving reduces new supply by 50%. Combined with demand from ETFs and institutional
adoption, the supply/demand math is straightforward.

### Stablecoin Supply as Leading Indicator

- Total stablecoin market cap (USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.) represents "dry powder" in crypto
- Growing stablecoin supply = money entering the ecosystem, waiting to deploy
- Declining stablecoin supply = money leaving
- USDT market cap consistently growing = structurally bullish signal
- Watch for large stablecoin mints/burns on-chain

### ETF Pipeline

- **Spot Bitcoin ETFs** approved January 10, 2024. Changed the game.
  - BlackRock's IBIT became the fastest ETF to $50B AUM in history
  - Created a direct pipeline from TradFi retirement accounts into BTC
  - Daily flow data is now a key metric
- **Spot Ethereum ETFs** approved mid-2024
  - Smaller flows than BTC but established ETH as "institutional grade"
- ETF flows create a feedback loop: inflows → price up → media coverage → more inflows

## 7. Election Cycles & Market Patterns

### Presidential Cycle

Historical US stock market pattern:
- **Year 1 (post-election):** Mixed. New president implements agenda. Uncertainty.
- **Year 2 (midterm):** Often weakest. Political gridlock fears.
- **Year 3 (pre-election):** Historically strongest. Incumbent party stimulates economy.
- **Year 4 (election year):** Bullish. Nobody wants a recession during an election.

### Seasonal Patterns

- **"Sell in May and go away":** Stocks historically underperform May-October vs November-April.
  Crypto has shown a similar pattern in some years but less reliably.
- **January effect:** Historically strong start to the year, especially for small caps.
- **September:** Historically the worst month for stocks. Crypto has also been weak in September.
- **Q4:** Historically strong for both stocks and crypto ("Santa rally" / year-end positioning).
- **Tax loss harvesting (December):** Selling losers for tax benefits → temporary selling pressure.

### Crypto & Elections

- 2024 was the first cycle where crypto was a major political issue
- Trump campaigned as pro-crypto → BTC rallied on his election win
- The "Trump trade" included BTC alongside dollar strength and bank stocks
- Political donations from crypto industry (Fairshake PAC) made crypto a lobbying force
- Future elections: crypto policy positions will increasingly matter for price

## 8. Black Swan Scenarios That Move Crypto

### Exchange Collapses

- **Mt. Gox (2014):** 850,000 BTC lost. Killed the early bull market.
- **FTX (November 2022):** Second largest exchange collapsed in days. BTC: $21K → $15.5K.
  Triggered by CoinDesk exposing Alameda's balance sheet. Contagion took out BlockFi,
  Genesis, and nearly Gemini. Trust in centralized exchanges shattered.
- **Lesson:** Exchange risk is permanent. "Not your keys, not your coins" isn't just
  a meme. Exchange blow-ups cause the sharpest, fastest drops.

### Stablecoin Depegs

- **UST/LUNA (May 2022):** Algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg. $60B in value evaporated
  in a week. BTC dropped from $40K to $26K as the entire ecosystem deleveraged.
  Terra/LUNA was a death spiral: UST depeg → LUNA printed to defend → LUNA crashed →
  UST depegged further. Took Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Celsius, and Voyager with it.
- **USDC mini-depeg (March 2023):** Circle had $3.3B stuck at Silicon Valley Bank.
  USDC traded at $0.88 briefly. Recovered when FDIC guaranteed deposits.
- **Lesson:** Stablecoins are systemic. A USDT depeg would be an extinction-level event
  for crypto markets.

### Regulatory Crackdowns

- **China mining ban (June 2021):** China kicked out all Bitcoin miners. Hash rate
  dropped 50% overnight. BTC fell from $35K to $29K. But miners relocated (US, Kazakhstan,
  etc.) and hash rate recovered within months. Net positive long-term: decentralized mining.
- **SEC lawsuit blitz (2023):** Sued Coinbase and Binance. Created massive uncertainty
  about which tokens are securities. Chilled institutional adoption temporarily.
- **Operation Chokepoint 2.0 (2023):** Banking regulators pressured banks to cut off
  crypto companies. Silvergate, Signature Bank collapsed partly due to this.

### Banking Crises

- **Silicon Valley Bank (March 2023):** Second-largest bank failure in US history.
  Signature Bank and First Republic also fell. Paradoxically BULLISH for BTC.
  "Be your own bank" narrative surged. BTC rallied from $20K to $28K during the crisis.
  Fed created the BTFP (Bank Term Funding Program) to backstop banks — seen as stealth QE.
- **Credit Suisse (March 2023):** 167-year-old bank forced into UBS merger. European
  banking stress + US banking stress = systemic fear → flight to hard assets.

### Global Pandemic

- **COVID-19 (March 2020):** Everything crashed. BTC hit $3,800 on March 12 ("Black Thursday").
  Then the Fed went full money printer. BTC rallied from $3,800 to $69,000 in 20 months.
  The pandemic proved that BTC is not immune to liquidity crises but recovers fastest
  when central banks respond with stimulus.

### What They All Have in Common

Black swans in crypto follow a pattern:
1. Sudden shock → panic selling → massive leverage liquidations
2. Price overshoots to the downside
3. If the issue is crypto-native (exchange, stablecoin): recovery takes months
4. If the issue is macro (banking, pandemic): recovery is faster because central banks
   intervene, and that intervention is bullish for crypto

## ECHO Macro Playbook

How ECHO should use macro context when analyzing X sentiment.

### Rule 1: Sentiment Without Context Is Noise

If crypto Twitter is euphoric but the Fed just signaled more hikes, the euphoria is
wrong. If crypto Twitter is panicking but the Fed just cut rates, the panic is a
buying opportunity for most. Always weight macro regime over crowd sentiment.

### Rule 2: Know the Macro Regime

At any given time, classify the regime:

- **Risk-on:** Fed cutting or pausing, DXY falling, liquidity expanding, VIX low.
  In this regime, bullish sentiment is CONFIRMED by macro. Dips get bought.
- **Risk-off:** Fed hiking, DXY rising, liquidity tightening, VIX elevated.
  In this regime, bearish sentiment is CONFIRMED by macro. Rallies get sold.
- **Transition:** Fed pivoting. This is where the biggest moves happen.
  Sentiment will be confused and divided. The side that's aligned with the new
  macro direction wins.

### Rule 3: Calendar Awareness

Before reporting sentiment, check:
- Is there an FOMC meeting this week? → Sentiment is pre-positioning, not conviction.
- Is CPI/NFP releasing tomorrow? → Sentiment will reverse if the number surprises.
- Is it OPEX (options expiration, 3rd Friday of month)? → Price action is mechanical, not sentiment.
- Is it quarter-end? → Rebalancing flows distort everything.

### Rule 4: Identify When Sentiment Diverges from Macro

The most valuable signal ECHO can provide is when X sentiment DISAGREES with macro conditions:

- **Bearish sentiment + bullish macro = buying opportunity** (crowd is scared despite
  supportive conditions)
- **Bullish sentiment + bearish macro = danger** (crowd is complacent despite hostile conditions)
- **Aligned sentiment and macro = trend continuation** (less alpha, but useful confirmation)

### Rule 5: Geopolitical Event Triage

When a geopolitical event hits:
1. **Assess oil impact.** If oil spikes → inflation → Fed hawkish → bearish crypto chain.
   If oil doesn't move, the event is probably noise for crypto.
2. **Assess DXY impact.** Safe haven flows to USD? DXY up = crypto headwind.
3. **Assess duration.** One-off event (missile strike) = sell the news, often recovers.
   Sustained conflict (war, sanctions regime) = repricing that lasts.
4. **Watch the bond market.** If 10Y yields spike, it matters. If bonds shrug, stocks
   and crypto will recover.

### Rule 6: Fed Speaker Decoder

Not all Fed speakers are equal:
- **Powell** → Everything he says matters. Full stop.
- **Williams (NY Fed)** → Permanent voter, close to Powell. His views ≈ consensus.
- **Waller** → Influential on rate path. When he shifts, the committee shifts.
- **Kashkari, Bostic, other regionals** → Can move markets intraday but less weight.
- **@NickTimiraos article** → Treat as if the Fed said it directly.

### Rule 7: The Liquidity Hierarchy

When conflicting signals exist, this is the priority order:
1. Net Fed liquidity (reserves + TGA drain - RRP) → Trumps everything
2. DXY direction → Second most important
3. Rate expectations (Fed Funds Futures) → Third
4. Global M2 trend → Fourth (slower moving, bigger)
5. On-chain flows and ETF data → Fifth (crypto-specific)
6. X sentiment → Sixth. Sentiment confirms or contradicts the above. It does not lead.

### Rule 8: The Time Horizon Matters

- **Intraday:** Sentiment drives price. Macro is background.
- **Weekly:** Macro data releases drive price. Sentiment follows.
- **Monthly:** Liquidity conditions drive price. Sentiment and individual data points are noise.
- **Quarterly:** Fed policy regime drives price. Everything else is noise.

ECHO should always state which time horizon its sentiment analysis applies to.

### Rule 9: Real-Time Event Monitoring

During active macro events (FOMC, CPI release, geopolitical crisis):
- X sentiment changes minute by minute
- The FIRST reaction is often wrong
- Wait for the bond market to settle (30-60 min after data release) before trusting
  the sentiment narrative
- The "headline number vs. details" distinction matters — CPI might look hot on headline
  but cool on core, and the market will figure this out within an hour

### Rule 10: When to Override Sentiment

ECHO should explicitly flag when it's overriding pure sentiment reading with macro context:

> "X sentiment is 70% bullish on BTC, but FOMC is tomorrow and Fed Funds Futures show
> only 20% chance of a cut. This euphoria is fragile. Positioning for disappointment
> risk is elevated."

> "X sentiment is 80% bearish after a 5% BTC drop, but this coincides with yen carry
> unwind that's already reversing. BOJ walked back hawkish comments. The panic is
> likely a bottom signal, not a trend change."

This macro-contextualized sentiment is 10x more valuable than raw sentiment numbers.
