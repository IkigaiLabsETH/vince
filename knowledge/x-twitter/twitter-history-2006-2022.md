# Twitter History: 2006–2022 (Pre-Musk Acquisition)

A factual, date-stamped reference for understanding the platform that became X.

---

## Founding (2006)

**Background:** Twitter grew out of Odeo, a struggling podcasting startup in San Francisco. When Apple added podcasting to iTunes in mid-2005, Odeo's business model collapsed. The team started brainstorming new ideas.

- **Early 2006** — Jack Dorsey pitched the idea of an SMS-based status update service. He'd been thinking about it since 2000, inspired by AOL Instant Messenger away messages and bike messenger dispatch systems.
- **March 21, 2006** — Dorsey sent the first tweet: _"just setting up my twttr"_ at 9:50 PM PST. The name "twttr" was inspired by Flickr's vowel-dropping convention. Noah Glass is credited with coming up with the name after browsing the dictionary and landing on "twitter" — defined as "a short burst of inconsequential information" and "chirps from birds."
- **The founders:** Jack Dorsey (product/concept), Biz Stone (creative direction), Evan Williams (CEO of Odeo, later Twitter CEO), and Noah Glass (early development, later pushed out — largely written out of the company story).
- **July 15, 2006** — Twitter launched publicly at twttr.com. The SMS backbone was central: you'd text 40404 to post. This is why the 140-character limit existed — SMS messages maxed at 160 characters, minus 20 reserved for the username.
- **By end of 2006** — roughly 5,000 users. It was a toy for San Francisco tech people.

## Early Growth (2007–2009)

### SXSW 2007: The Breakout

- **March 2007** — Twitter placed 60-inch plasma screens in the hallways at South by Southwest Interactive in Austin, streaming tweets in real-time. Conference attendees went from "what is this" to obsessed in 48 hours. Twitter usage tripled during the event, jumping from 20,000 to 60,000 tweets per day.
- **This is the era Yves signed up.** Early 2007 Twitter was raw, personal, and weird. No brands, no algorithms, no ads. Just people posting what they had for lunch and accidentally inventing a new communication medium.

### User-Invented Features

Twitter's most defining features weren't built by Twitter — users made them up:

- **@replies** — Users started typing @username to direct messages at people. Twitter didn't formally support this until May 2007.
- **Hashtags** — **August 23, 2007:** Chris Messina (an open-source advocate, not a Twitter employee) tweeted: _"how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp?"_ Twitter initially dismissed it. It took until July 2009 for Twitter to make hashtags clickable links.
- **RT (retweet)** — Users manually typed "RT @username" to reshare tweets. Twitter didn't add an official retweet button until November 2009.

### The Fail Whale

- **2007–2009** — Twitter went down constantly. The site couldn't handle its own growth. Users saw the "Fail Whale" illustration (by Yiying Lu) so often it became an icon. At peak, Twitter went down multiple times per day. The running joke: Twitter's most reliable feature was being unreliable.

### Global Moments

- **January 15, 2009** — Janis Krums tweeted a photo of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River, minutes after the crash landing. The image spread globally before any news outlet reported it. This was the moment mainstream media realized Twitter was a news wire.
- **April 2009** — Ashton Kutcher raced CNN's @cnnbrk to become the first Twitter account with 1 million followers. Kutcher won on April 17, 2009. It felt important at the time. Larry King covered it live.
- **June 2009** — Iran's Green Revolution. After disputed elections, Iranian protestors organized and documented police violence on Twitter. The U.S. State Department asked Twitter to delay scheduled maintenance so Iranian users could keep posting. Western media called it the "Twitter Revolution." The reality was more complicated — most coordination happened via SMS and word of mouth — but Twitter's role in amplifying the story to the outside world was real.

### API Ecosystem

- **2007–2009** — Twitter's open API spawned thousands of third-party apps. TweetDeck, Twitterrific, Tweetbot, and others often provided better experiences than Twitter's own website. At one point, more people used Twitter through third-party clients than through twitter.com. This openness built the platform but would later become a point of tension.

### Key Numbers (End of 2009)

- ~58 million monthly visitors
- ~50 million tweets per day
- Total employees: ~130
- Revenue: essentially zero

## Scaling & Monetization (2010–2013)

### Finding a Business Model

- **April 13, 2010** — Twitter launched Promoted Tweets, its first advertising product. Brands could pay to have tweets appear in search results. Initial advertisers included Starbucks, Virgin America, Bravo, and Red Bull.
- **September 2010** — New Twitter redesign shipped. The company started pulling users away from third-party clients toward its own apps and website.
- **October 2010** — Dick Costolo became CEO, replacing Evan Williams. Costolo was a former improv comedian turned tech exec who had joined as COO. His mandate: turn Twitter into a real business.

### Arab Spring (2010–2012)

- **December 2010 – 2012** — Twitter (and Facebook) played a major role in the Arab Spring uprisings across Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Syria, and Yemen. Protestors used Twitter to organize, document, and broadcast. Governments responded by shutting down internet access entirely. The "Twitter as revolutionary tool" narrative peaked here.

### Vine

- **October 2012** — Twitter acquired Vine, a short-form video app, before it even launched. Vine went live in January 2013 with its signature 6-second looping videos. It became a cultural phenomenon, launching creators like King Bach, Lele Pons, and the "Why you always lyin'" guy. Twitter would kill Vine in October 2016 — a decision widely regarded as one of the worst product calls in tech history. TikTok later filled the exact gap Vine left.

### IPO

- **November 7, 2013** — Twitter went public on the NYSE under ticker TWTR. IPO price: $26 per share. It opened at $45.10, a 73% pop. The company was valued at ~$31 billion at close of first trading day. Twitter reported 232 million monthly active users and $534 million in revenue for 2013 (still not profitable).

### Key Numbers (End of 2013)

- 241 million monthly active users
- ~500 million tweets per day
- Revenue: $665 million (full year 2013)
- Employees: ~2,700
- Stock price at year end: ~$63

## The Platform Era (2014–2017)

### Identity Crisis

- **2014–2015** — Twitter's user growth stalled. Wall Street panicked. The stock cratered from its ~$69 peak (December 2013) to under $30 by mid-2015. Every earnings call, analysts asked the same question: why isn't Twitter growing like Facebook?
- **June 2015** — Dick Costolo stepped down as CEO.
- **October 5, 2015** — Jack Dorsey returned as permanent CEO while simultaneously running Square (his payments company). Many questioned whether he could handle both jobs. He would hold both CEO roles for the next six years.

### Product Changes

- **January 2015** — Twitter acquired Periscope, a live-streaming app, for ~$100 million. Periscope launched in March 2015 and won an Apple Design Award, but never reached critical mass. Twitter shut it down in March 2021.
- **October 2015** — Twitter launched Moments, a curated news feature. It was supposed to make Twitter accessible to casual users who found the raw feed overwhelming. It never caught on.
- **November 7, 2017** — Twitter doubled the character limit from 140 to 280. The announcement triggered apocalyptic reactions from longtime users who insisted the constraint was the whole point. The backlash faded within weeks. Most tweets stayed under 140 characters anyway.

### Abuse and Harassment

- **2014–2017** — Twitter's harassment problem became impossible to ignore. High-profile incidents included:
  - **August 2014** — Gamergate: coordinated harassment campaigns against women in gaming flooded Twitter. The platform's response was slow and inadequate.
  - **July 2016** — Leslie Jones (Ghostbusters) was driven off Twitter by racist abuse. Jack Dorsey personally intervened, and Milo Yiannopoulos was permanently banned.
  - Twitter introduced new tools: muting (2014), quality filter (2016), and anti-abuse algorithms. Critics said it was too little, too late. Defenders said content moderation at scale was genuinely hard.

### Trump's Twitter Presidency

- **June 16, 2015** — Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign. He had ~3 million followers.
- **November 8, 2016** — Trump won the election. His Twitter account became arguably the most consequential communication channel of any world leader. By inauguration, he had ~20 million followers.
- **2017 onward** — @realDonaldTrump became the de facto White House press room. Markets moved on his tweets. Foreign policy was announced via tweet. Twitter became the center of American political discourse whether it wanted to be or not.

### Key Numbers (End of 2017)

- 330 million monthly active users
- Revenue: $2.44 billion (2017)
- Net loss: $108 million (2017) — still not consistently profitable
- Employees: ~3,400
- Stock price: ~$24 (down from $69 peak)

## Content Moderation Wars (2018–2020)

### The Deplatforming Debates

- **August 6, 2018** — Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify banned Alex Jones and InfoWars. Twitter initially refused, with Jack Dorsey arguing Jones hadn't violated Twitter's rules. Twitter finally banned Jones on September 6, 2018, after he harassed a CNN reporter during a congressional hearing.
- **The Alex Jones episode crystallized the debate:** Should platforms be neutral pipes or active editors? Twitter tried to occupy a middle ground that satisfied nobody.

### Jack Dorsey Testifies

- **September 5, 2018** — Dorsey testified before Congress about alleged political bias. He sat through hours of questions ranging from thoughtful to unhinged. Republican members accused Twitter of shadow-banning conservatives. Democrats pushed for stronger moderation against misinformation.

### Bluesky Announced

- **December 11, 2019** — Dorsey announced Twitter was funding an independent team called Bluesky to develop a "decentralized standard for social media." The idea: create an open protocol (like email) that no single company controls. It would take years to materialize into an actual product.

### COVID-19

- **March 2020 onward** — The pandemic turned Twitter into a real-time information battleground. Twitter implemented new policies at speed:
  - Labels on misleading COVID tweets (starting March 2020)
  - Removal of tweets that could cause direct harm (e.g., "drinking bleach cures COVID")
  - Warning labels on tweets from world leaders that violated rules but were deemed "in the public interest"
- **April 7, 2020** — Dorsey pledged $1 billion of his Square equity (~28% of his wealth) to COVID relief through his Start Small initiative. It was one of the largest individual charitable commitments in history.

### Trump Account Actions

- **May 26, 2020** — Twitter applied a fact-check label to a Trump tweet about mail-in voting for the first time. Trump responded with an executive order targeting Section 230 (the law shielding platforms from liability for user content).
- **May 29, 2020** — Twitter hid a Trump tweet about Minneapolis protests ("when the looting starts, the shooting starts") behind a warning label for glorifying violence. This was unprecedented for a sitting president.
- **October 2020** — Twitter locked the New York Post's account over its Hunter Biden laptop story, citing its hacked materials policy. The backlash was intense from both sides. Twitter later admitted the decision was wrong.

### Key Numbers (End of 2020)

- 192 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU) — Twitter switched from MAU to mDAU reporting in 2019
- Revenue: $3.72 billion (2020)
- First annual profit in 2018 ($1.2B), then 2019 ($1.47B); 2020 dipped to net loss of $1.14B (COVID ad pullback + costs)
- Employees: ~5,500

## Pre-Acquisition Tensions (2021–2022)

### The Trump Ban

- **January 6, 2021** — U.S. Capitol breach. Twitter initially gave Trump a 12-hour suspension.
- **January 8, 2021** — Twitter permanently suspended @realDonaldTrump, citing "the risk of further incitement of violence." The account had 88.7 million followers. The decision was the most consequential content moderation action in social media history. Jack Dorsey posted a thread saying he didn't celebrate the ban and that it set a dangerous precedent for a private company to have that much power.

### Leadership Change

- **November 29, 2021** — Jack Dorsey resigned as CEO. Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CTO since 2017, took over. Agrawal was a low-profile engineer — the opposite of Dorsey's public persona. Dorsey tweeted that the company was "ready to move on" from its founders.

### The Edit Button Saga

- **2020–2022** — "Will Twitter ever get an edit button?" became one of the internet's longest-running jokes. Every few months it trended. Twitter finally started testing an edit feature in September 2022 (Twitter Blue subscribers only). By then, other events had overtaken the conversation.

### Musk Enters

- **January 31, 2022** — Elon Musk began buying Twitter shares. He accumulated a 9.2% stake (73.5 million shares) by early April without initially disclosing it (he filed the required SEC form late).
- **April 4, 2022** — Musk disclosed his stake. He was Twitter's largest individual shareholder.
- **April 5, 2022** — Twitter offered Musk a board seat. He accepted, then declined on April 9.
- **April 14, 2022** — Musk offered to buy Twitter outright for $54.20 per share (~$44 billion). The "$420" reference was not subtle.
- **April 15, 2022** — Twitter's board adopted a "poison pill" defense.
- **April 25, 2022** — Twitter's board unanimously accepted Musk's offer.
- **May–July 2022** — Musk tried to back out, claiming Twitter undercounted bots and spam accounts. Twitter sued to enforce the deal. Musk countersued.
- **October 4, 2022** — Musk reversed course and agreed to complete the acquisition at the original price.
- **October 27, 2022** — Musk closed the deal. He walked into Twitter HQ carrying a sink ("let that sink in"). He fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and legal chief Vijaya Gadde immediately.

## Cultural Impact: Things Twitter Gave Us

- **Breaking news in real-time** — Earthquakes, shootings, elections, coups. Twitter was consistently 5–30 minutes ahead of cable news.
- **Hashtag activism** — #BlackLivesMatter (2013), #MeToo (2017), #ArabSpring, #OccupyWallStreet
- **Quote tweet culture** — Dunking, ratio-ing, main character of the day
- **Crypto Twitter (CT)** — The financial subculture that moved markets with memes and alpha. Born around 2017, exploded in 2020–2021. This is ECHO's home turf.
- **Stan Twitter** — K-pop fans, Swifties, Barbz — organized fandoms that could trend anything
- **Journalists on Twitter** — For better or worse, the media class lived on Twitter. Newsrooms monitored it 24/7. "The ratio" could sink a career.

## Why This Matters for ECHO

Understanding Twitter's history isn't academic — it's operational context for reading sentiment correctly.

**Platform mechanics shape discourse.** The 140-character limit forced compression, which created the punchy, aggressive, meme-heavy communication style that still defines CT. When you see a tweet that's 280 characters, the author chose to use that space. When they kept it under 140, they're speaking the old language.

**Moderation history creates trust layers.** Every ban, every label, every policy change left scars on different user communities. When CT users say "this platform is dead" or "we're moving to [alternative]," that sentiment has roots going back to 2018's deplatforming debates. The fear of account suspension shapes how people self-censor — or don't.

**User cohort matters.** Someone who joined in 2007 (like Yves) experienced Twitter as a weird, intimate, 140-character SMS toy. Someone who joined in 2017 experienced it as a political war zone. Someone who joined in 2021 experienced it as a financial market. These cohorts have fundamentally different relationships with the platform, and their sentiment signals mean different things.

**The Musk acquisition was a phase change.** Everything before October 27, 2022 is the "old Twitter" baseline. Sentiment patterns, engagement norms, user behavior, trust levels — all of these shifted after acquisition. To understand what changed, you need to know what existed before.

**CT specifically:** Crypto Twitter emerged as a distinct subculture around 2017 and became a major financial information network by 2020. Its conventions — the anon profile pics, the thread culture, the "gm" greetings, the call-out posts — all developed on pre-Musk Twitter. The social graph, the trust networks, the reputation systems that CT runs on were built over years on this platform. When ECHO reads CT sentiment, it's reading signals that travel through infrastructure built across this entire 16-year history.

Know the ground you're standing on.
