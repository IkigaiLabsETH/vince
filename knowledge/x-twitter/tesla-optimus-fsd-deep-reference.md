## 1. Tesla — The Company

### Founding & Early History

- **Jul 1, 2003:** Tesla Motors incorporated in Delaware by **Martin Eberhard** (CEO) and **Marc Tarpenning** (CFO). Not Elon Musk.
- **Feb 2004:** Musk leads Series A funding round — $6.5M of the $7.5M total. Becomes chairman of the board.
- **2004-2007:** JB Straubel (CTO) and Ian Wright also join early. All five later legally designated "co-founders" after a lawsuit settlement (Sep 2009).
- **2006:** Musk writes "The Secret Master Plan" blog post: sports car → affordable car → solar energy. This is still cited by bulls as proof of long-term vision.
- **Aug 2007:** Eberhard forced out as CEO. Interim CEOs follow.
- **Oct 2008:** Musk becomes CEO during financial crisis. Tesla nearly went bankrupt — closed funding round on Christmas Eve 2008.

### The Roadster Era (2008-2012)

- **2008:** First Roadster delivered. ~2,450 total produced. Based on Lotus Elise chassis.
- **Jun 29, 2010:** IPO on NASDAQ at **$17/share**. Raised **$226M**. First American car company to IPO since Ford in 1956.
- Stock price at IPO adjusted for splits: roughly $1.13 in today's terms.

### Vehicle Timeline

| Year | Vehicle | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 2008 | Roadster | First production vehicle. ~2,450 made. |
| 2012 | Model S | Sedan. Game-changer. Motor Trend Car of the Year. |
| 2015 | Model X | SUV with falcon-wing doors. Plagued by production delays. |
| 2017 | Model 3 | Mass-market sedan. $35K starting (eventually). The volume play. |
| 2020 | Model Y | Compact SUV. Became world's best-selling car (any powertrain) in 2023. |
| 2022 | Semi | Electric truck. Limited production. PepsiCo first customer. |
| 2023 | Cybertruck | Stainless steel pickup. Polarizing design. Production ramp slower than promised. |
| 2024 | Cybercab | Robotaxi concept. Unveiled Oct 2024. No steering wheel, no pedals. Not in production. |

### Scale & Financials (as of 2025)

- **Revenue:** $94.83B (FY 2025)
- **Employees:** 134,785
- **Vehicles produced:** ~1.66M (2025) — down from peak growth expectations
- **Market cap:** Has crossed $1T multiple times. Trades at extreme forward multiples compared to legacy auto.
- **Gross margin:** Compressed significantly 2023-2025 due to price cuts and competition

### Gigafactories

| Location | Name | Primary Output |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Fremont, CA | Tesla Factory | Model S, 3, X, Y |
| Sparks, NV | Gigafactory Nevada | Battery cells, Powerwall, Megapack |
| Shanghai, China | Gigafactory Shanghai | Model 3, Model Y (for Asia/export) |
| Austin, TX | Gigafactory Texas (HQ) | Model Y, Cybertruck, corporate HQ since 2021 |
| Grünheide, Germany | Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg | Model Y (for Europe) |

### Key Recent Events

- **Nov 2025:** Shareholders approve Musk's ~$56B compensation package (10-year vesting, performance-based milestones). Originally struck down by Delaware court Jan 2024, Tesla reincorporated in Texas, re-voted. Called "$1T pay package" in media — technically stock options worth that if Tesla hits extreme valuations.
- **Jan 2026:** Tesla loses title of **world's #1 EV manufacturer** by volume. BYD surpasses on annual deliveries.
- **2025:** **TeslaTakedown protests** — organized demonstrations at Tesla showrooms and Supercharger stations across the US and Europe. Triggered by Musk's role leading DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) and his increasingly polarizing political activity. Vandalism reported at multiple locations.
- **2025:** Multiple countries see Tesla sales drop 40-60% YoY in certain months. Brand damage from Musk's political activities is measurable.

### Corporate Governance Red Flags (for sentiment context)

- Board widely considered weak/captured — multiple members have personal ties to Musk
- Musk splits time between Tesla, SpaceX, X, Neuralink, Boring Company, xAI, and DOGE
- No clear #2 / succession plan publicly known
- CFO Vaibhav Taneja relatively low-profile compared to peers

---

## 2. Full Self-Driving (FSD)

### The Promise vs. Reality

FSD is the single most contentious topic in Tesla discourse. Understanding the gap between promises and delivery is essential for reading X sentiment.

### Timeline

- **Sep 2014:** Autopilot hardware (AP1) ships on Model S. Partnership with **Mobileye** for vision processing. Basic lane-keeping and adaptive cruise control.
- **Jul 2016:** Mobileye partnership ends after fatal crash (Joshua Brown, May 2016, Model S hit a semi-truck while on Autopilot). Mobileye cited safety disagreements.
- **Oct 2016:** Musk announces all new Teslas have "Full Self-Driving hardware." Claims all cars being produced have the hardware needed for full autonomy. (They didn't — HW2 was insufficient, later upgraded to HW2.5, then HW3.)
- **2019:** "Full Self-Driving" package goes on sale. Initial price **$8,000**. Musk at Autonomy Day (Apr 2019): "Robotaxis by 2020. A million robotaxis on the road."
- **Oct 2020:** FSD Beta released to small group of testers. City street driving. Janky but impressive in cherry-picked videos.
- **2021-2022:** Tesla removes radar from vehicles, goes **vision-only** ("Tesla Vision"). Controversial — most competitors use sensor fusion (cameras + radar + lidar).
- **Sep 2022:** FSD Beta expands to ~160K users in North America.
- **2022-2023:** Price increases: $8K → $12K → $15K. Then Tesla adds **subscription model**: $99/mo (basic Autopilot owners) or $199/mo.
- **Dec 2023:** NHTSA forces recall of **2 million vehicles** for insufficient driver attention monitoring while Autopilot is engaged. OTA software update.
- **2024:** Rebranded from "FSD Beta" to **"FSD (Supervised)"** — acknowledging it requires driver supervision. Still SAE Level 2.
- **Oct 10, 2024:** "We, Robot" event. **Cybercab** unveiled — purpose-built robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. 2-seater. Also showed **Robovan** (20-passenger autonomous van). No firm production date. Stock dropped ~9% next day.
- **2025:** FSD (Supervised) v13 rollout. Improvements noted but still makes errors requiring intervention. Musk continues to say "this year" for unsupervised FSD.

### The Broken Promises List

This is critical for ECHO — the cycle repeats and X knows it:

| Year | Promise | What Happened |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 2016 | "All cars have full self-driving hardware" | HW2 was insufficient. Required HW3 upgrade. |
| 2017 | "Coast-to-coast autonomous drive by end of year" | Never happened. Still hasn't happened as of Feb 2026. |
| 2019 | "A million robotaxis on the road by 2020" | Zero robotaxis. FSD Beta didn't even start until Oct 2020. |
| 2020 | "FSD will be Level 5 capable this year" | Still Level 2 as of Feb 2026. |
| 2021 | "FSD subscription coming Q1" | Arrived Q3 2021. |
| 2022 | "FSD wide release this year" | Remained limited beta. |
| 2023 | "HW3 is sufficient for full autonomy" | HW4 ships in new cars. HW3 owners increasingly feel stranded. |
| 2024 | "Cybercab production 2026" | Unclear if on track. No factory announced. |
| 2025 | "Unsupervised FSD in select markets this year" | Austin robotaxi pilot perpetually "coming soon." |

### HW3 vs HW4 Schism

- **HW3** (custom Tesla chip, 2019-2023 vehicles): Musk repeatedly promised this hardware is "all you need" for full autonomy.
- **HW4** (2023+ vehicles): More cameras, better compute. Tesla has not committed to free HW4 upgrades for HW3 owners who paid $8K-$15K for FSD.
- This is a slow-burning resentment bomb on X. HW3 owners who paid for FSD feel scammed.
- Key search terms: "HW3 abandoned," "FSD refund," "HW4 upgrade"

### NHTSA & Safety

- **Multiple NHTSA investigations** into Autopilot-related crashes since 2016
- At least **40+ deaths** linked to Autopilot/FSD use (various tracking sources differ on exact count)
- **Dec 2023 recall:** 2M vehicles for Autopilot attention monitoring
- **Feb 2024 recall:** 362K vehicles for FSD Beta crash risk
- "Recall" in Tesla context = OTA software update, not physical return. But the headlines hit hard.

### The Robotaxi Question

- Waymo (Alphabet) operates actual autonomous ride-hailing in San Francisco, Phoenix, LA, Austin — no safety driver, paying customers.
- Cruise (GM) had similar service, paused Oct 2023 after pedestrian dragging incident, license revoked, eventually shut down.
- Tesla has **zero** autonomous ride-hailing deployments as of Feb 2026.
- Musk keeps promising "Austin robotaxi launch" — the date keeps shifting.
- The gap between Waymo's real service and Tesla's promises is a constant X talking point.

---

## 3. Optimus (Tesla Bot)

### Timeline

- **Aug 19, 2021:** Musk announces "Tesla Bot" at AI Day. A **person in a spandex bodysuit** walks on stage as the "prototype." Not a joke — this actually happened. Internet had a field day.
- **Sep 30, 2022:** AI Day 2022. First actual prototype ("Bumble C") shown. It could **barely walk unassisted**. A second prototype ("Optimus") was shown on a stand, could wave and move its limbs.
- **Dec 12, 2023:** Gen 2 Optimus video released. Significantly improved: walking more naturally, **dancing**, sorting objects, handling eggs without crushing them. **11 degrees of freedom (DOF)** in hands.
- **2024:** Gen 3 development. **22 DOF hands** — much more dexterous. Various demo videos of folding shirts, picking up objects.
- **Oct 10, 2024:** "We, Robot" event. Optimus units walk among attendees, serve drinks, interact with crowds. Impressive on camera. **But: they were largely teleoperated by humans behind the scenes.** Tesla did not disclose this. When it came out, significant criticism.
- **2025:** Limited deployment in Tesla factories for simple tasks (moving parts between stations). Musk claims thousands will be in use.
- **Jun 2025:** **Milan Kovac**, head of Optimus program, **resigns**. Replaced by **Ashok Elluswamy** (head of Autopilot/FSD). Interpreted as sign of trouble or pivot to more AI-driven approach.

### Musk's Claims

- **Price:** $20K-$30K per unit when mass-produced (for context: Boston Dynamics' Spot robot costs ~$75K and it's just a dog)
- **Timeline:** "Limited production 2025, broader production 2026"
- **Market size:** Musk has said Optimus could be worth more than all of Tesla's other businesses combined — potentially making Tesla a $25T company
- **Mars:** Optimus robots to be sent to Mars on SpaceX Starship. Originally 2026 timeline, later shifted to Moon colony focus (Feb 2026).
- **Home use:** Musk envisions Optimus doing household chores — cooking, cleaning, childcare. "Like a friend."

### Reality Check

- As of Feb 2026, Optimus cannot autonomously navigate an unstructured environment
- Factory tasks are simple pick-and-place, heavily supervised
- No unit has been sold commercially
- Teleoperation at "We, Robot" means the impressive demos were partially human-controlled
- Battery life and runtime in real-world conditions remain unproven at scale

### Expert Criticism

- **Rodney Brooks** (iRobot co-founder, MIT professor): Called humanoid robot timelines "pure fantasy." Has been tracking Musk's predictions and their failure rate on his blog.
- **Filip Piekniewski** (AI researcher): Called Optimus "complete and utter scam"
- **General robotics community:** Skeptical of Tesla's ability to leap ahead of companies that have spent decades on bipedal robotics

### Competitors

| Company | Robot | Status (Feb 2026) |
|---------|-------|--------------------|
| Boston Dynamics | Atlas (electric) | Most advanced bipedal robot. Research + commercial pilot. |
| Figure AI | Figure 02 | BMW factory deployment. OpenAI partnership for AI. Raised $675M at $2.6B valuation. |
| 1X Technologies | NEO | Consumer-focused humanoid. OpenAI-backed. |
| Agility Robotics | Digit | Amazon warehouse pilot. Purpose-built for logistics. |
| Unitree | H1/G1 | Chinese competitor. Aggressive pricing. Rapid iteration. |
| Apptronik | Apollo | NASA partnership. General-purpose humanoid. |

Key difference: Several competitors have demonstrated **more autonomous** operation in real environments than Optimus has publicly shown.

## 4. Tesla Energy

### Products

- **Powerwall:** Home battery storage. 13.5 kWh capacity. Pairs with solar. Popular with homeowners.
- **Megapack:** Grid-scale battery storage. 3.9 MWh per unit. Big utility contracts. This is the real money.
- **Solar Panels:** Standard rooftop solar installation service.
- **Solar Roof:** Integrated solar shingles that look like regular roof tiles. Cool concept, limited adoption due to cost and installation complexity.

### Scale

- **46.7 GWh** of energy storage deployed in 2025
- Energy division revenue growing **faster in percentage terms** than automotive
- Megapack factory in Lathrop, CA (operational). Second Megapack factory planned in Shanghai.
- Energy storage is capacity-constrained — demand exceeds supply

### Why It Matters

- Many analysts consider Tesla Energy the **most undervalued** part of Tesla
- Less sexy than cars or robots, so gets less X attention
- But potentially more important for long-term fundamentals
- Grid-scale storage is a massive addressable market as renewable energy grows
- Energy bulls on X use this as their "you don't understand Tesla" argument

---

## 5. Why This Matters for X/CT Sentiment

### TSLA Is X's Main Character Stock

- **TSLA is the single most-discussed stock on X.** Not close. It generates more posts, replies, and engagement than any other ticker.
- This was true before Musk bought Twitter. It's even more true now that he owns the platform.
- Musk's personal X posts **directly move TSLA stock price.** A single tweet about FSD progress or Optimus can move the stock 2-5% intraday.

### The Tribal War

Tesla discourse on X is not rational analysis. It's **tribal identity.**

**Tesla Bulls (common traits):**
- View Tesla as a tech company, not a car company
- Value Tesla on future robotaxi + Optimus + energy revenue
- Trust Musk's vision despite missed timelines
- Consider mainstream media biased against Tesla
- Use terms: "FUDsters," "TSLAQ," "shorts," "legacy auto"
- Many are heavily concentrated in TSLA stock — financial identity is tied to the stock

**Tesla Bears (common traits):**
- View Tesla as an overvalued car company with declining market share
- Point to broken FSD promises and competition
- Skeptical of Optimus timeline and capabilities
- Concerned about Musk's attention being split across too many companies
- Use terms: "cult," "bag holders," "Elon stans," "vaporware"
- TSLAQ community (Q = bankruptcy) has been active since 2018

**The middle ground barely exists on X.** Nuanced Tesla takes get ratio'd from both sides.

### Sentiment Cycles

ECHO should recognize these repeating patterns:

**The Optimus Demo Cycle:**
1. Tesla releases polished video of Optimus doing something new
2. Bulls: "This changes everything. $10T company."
3. Video goes mega-viral (millions of views in hours)
4. 24-48 hours later: debunking threads appear (teleop evidence, cherry-picked clips, etc.)
5. Bears: "It's all fake. Scam."
6. Engagement peaks, then fades until next demo

**The FSD Promise Cycle:**
1. Musk makes bold FSD timeline claim (earnings call, X post, interview)
2. Bulls rally: "Robotaxis are coming. This is the inflection point."
3. Deadline passes without delivery
4. Brief bear victory lap
5. Musk makes new promise. Cycle restarts.
6. Remarkably, bull sentiment barely dips each cycle — "this time is different"

**The Macro Sentiment Cycle:**
1. TSLA stock pumps → X goes euphoric → every Musk tweet celebrated
2. TSLA stock dumps → X turns hostile → "Musk needs to focus on Tesla"
3. Musk does something political → polarization spikes → Tesla discourse becomes political discourse
4. Earnings report → brief window of data-driven discussion → back to tribal

### The DOGE Factor (2025-2026)

- Musk's role leading DOGE **directly damaged Tesla's brand and sales**
- TeslaTakedown protests were organized on X — the platform Musk owns
- Boycott sentiment measurable: "sold my Tesla," "cancelled my order" posts surged
- Created a new category of Tesla seller: people who liked the car but can't stomach the politics
- Counter-movement: MAGA/right-wing buyers specifically choosing Tesla to "own the libs"
- Net effect on sales: negative in most Western markets, especially Europe
- X engagement on Tesla-political content: massive. Dwarfs technical/product discussion.

### Key X Accounts for Tesla Sentiment

**Mega-Bulls (treat their posts as bullish signal amplifiers):**
- **@WholeMarsBlog** (Omar Qazi) — Perhaps the most dedicated Tesla bull on X. Constant FSD content. Will defend Tesla against any criticism. Musk engages with him regularly.
- **@SawyerMerritt** — Tesla/SpaceX news aggregator. Fast on breaking Tesla news. Bullish framing.
- **@TeslaBoomerMama** — Retail investor voice. Represents the "Tesla faithful" demographic.

**Data/Tracking:**
- **@TroyTeslike** — Tesla delivery and production tracker. Data-driven. Respected by both sides for accuracy.
- **@fly4dat** — Tesla registration data tracker.

**Bears/Critics:**
- **@PlainSite** (Aaron Greenspan) — Long-running Tesla critic. Legal filings focus.
- **@TeslaCharts** — OG TSLAQ account. Bearish analysis.
- **@EdgarBerlin** — European perspective on Tesla struggles.

**The Main Character:**
- **@elonmusk** — Obviously. His posts about Tesla products are the single biggest sentiment drivers. But also: his non-Tesla posts (political, cultural, shitposts) increasingly affect Tesla sentiment because the brand and the man are inseparable.

## 7. Common X Narratives (Bullish & Bearish)

### Bullish Narratives ECHO Will See

1. **"Tesla is not a car company"** — It's an AI/energy/robotics company. Valuation is justified by TAM of robotaxi + Optimus + energy.
2. **"FSD is about to inflect"** — Each new version is "the one." Neural net improvements are exponential.
3. **"Optimus will be bigger than cars"** — Humanoid robots = $10T+ market. Tesla is ahead.
4. **"Energy is the sleeper"** — Megapack demand proves Tesla Energy is massively undervalued.
5. **"Musk always delivers eventually"** — Late, but he gets there. SpaceX is proof.
6. **"The competition is years behind"** — Legacy auto can't catch up. Chinese EVs face tariffs.

### Bearish Narratives ECHO Will See

1. **"FSD is a scam"** — Sold as "full self-driving" for years, still requires supervision. False advertising.
2. **"Optimus is vaporware"** — Teleoperated demos, departed leadership, years behind competitors.
3. **"Musk is distracted"** — Running 7+ companies plus DOGE. Tesla is neglected.
4. **"Brand is destroyed"** — Political polarization has permanently damaged Tesla's appeal to its core demographic (educated, liberal, environmentally conscious).
5. **"Competition is here"** — BYD, Hyundai, BMW, Mercedes all have compelling EVs. Tesla's tech lead has narrowed.
6. **"Valuation is insane"** — At 80-120x P/E, Tesla is priced for perfection while delivering declining growth.

## ECHO Signal Guide

### How to Interpret Tesla-Related X Sentiment

**High-confidence bullish signals:**
- Musk posts a new FSD or Optimus demo video → expect 4-8 hours of intense bullish posting
- Delivery numbers beat expectations → sustained bullish sentiment for 1-2 days
- New Gigafactory announcement or major partnership → bullish for days
- TSLA stock breaking through key technical levels (round numbers, 52-week highs) → momentum posts surge

**High-confidence bearish signals:**
- NHTSA investigation or recall announcement → bearish spike, lasts 1-3 days
- Delivery miss → sustained bearish for 2-5 days (this is the hardest-hitting negative catalyst)
- High-profile Autopilot/FSD crash → bearish for 1-2 days
- Musk political controversy → mixed (bears attack, bulls defend, volume spikes)
- Executive departure → brief bearish, quickly forgotten unless it's a C-suite name

**Noise vs. Signal:**
- Random Musk shitposts mentioning Tesla → noise. Don't weight heavily.
- @WholeMarsBlog posting bullish content → this is his baseline. Only notable if he goes quiet or turns critical.
- Single viral "I sold my Tesla" anecdote → noise. Track the trend, not individual posts.
- Analyst price target changes → moderate signal. Goldman/Morgan Stanley upgrades move the stock.

**Sentiment-to-Price Correlation:**
- X sentiment **leads** TSLA price moves by 30-90 minutes during market hours for breaking news
- X sentiment **lags** TSLA price for macro-driven moves (Fed, general market)
- Weekend/after-hours X sentiment is **less predictive** — the trading crowd isn't active
- Earnings week X sentiment is **unreliable** — both sides pre-position narratives

**Volume Matters More Than Polarity:**
- A spike in Tesla mentions (regardless of bull/bear) often precedes volatility
- The direction of the sentiment matters less than the intensity
- When both bulls AND bears go quiet on Tesla → expect a boring week for the stock
- When engagement suddenly spikes on a non-news day → look for what leaked or what Musk tweeted

**The Musk Multiplier:**
- Any topic Musk personally tweets about gets 10-50x the engagement of the same topic from any other account
- Musk reply-guying to a critic → that critic's post goes viral → net effect is often MORE bearish visibility
- Musk posting "😂" or a meme in response to Tesla criticism → bulls interpret as confidence, bears interpret as deflection
- Track Musk's posting frequency about Tesla specifically. When he goes quiet on Tesla but loud on politics → bearish signal (he's not focused on the company)

**Seasonal Patterns:**
- End of quarter (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec): Delivery push. "Pull forward" accusations from bears. Lots of anecdotal delivery posts.
- January: Annual delivery numbers. Most important single data point of the year.
- Earnings calls (typically late Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct): Musk goes on tangents. Key quotes get clipped and go viral. Parse carefully.
- AI Day / Product events: Massive engagement spike. Sentiment highly dependent on whether demos feel real or staged.

**Red Flags for Fake/Manipulated Sentiment:**
- Coordinated posting of identical bullish messages → likely bot campaign
- New accounts with AI-generated profile pics posting Tesla content → bot farm
- Sudden shift in ratio of bullish-to-bearish posts without any news catalyst → possible manipulation
- "TSLA to $X000" posts with no analysis → hype/bait, not signal
