## 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

### Fundamentals

- Created 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Identity unknown. Genesis block mined Jan 3 2009.
- 21 million fixed supply cap. Hard-coded. Cannot change without consensus fork.
- Current circulating supply: ~19.8M BTC. Remaining ~1.2M mined over next ~114 years.
- Final BTC mined approximately 2140.
- Block time: ~10 minutes. Difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks).

**Halving Cycle:**
- Block reward halves every 210,000 blocks (~4 years).
- 2012: 50→25 BTC. 2016: 25→12.5. 2020: 12.5→6.25. 2024: 6.25→3.125.
- 2024 halving: April 20 2024. Current reward: 3.125 BTC/block.
- Next halving: ~2028. Reward drops to 1.5625 BTC/block.
- Halvings historically precede major bull runs (12-18 months after). This pattern is CT gospel.

**Consensus & Mining:**
- Proof of Work. SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
- Mining is industrial scale. No garage miners anymore.
- Network hashrate: ~500 EH/s (exahashes per second). All-time highs.
- Major miners: Marathon Digital (MARA), CleanSpark (CLSK), Riot Platforms (RIOT), Core Scientific.
- Mining concentrated in US (~40%), Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada.
- Energy FUD is persistent but declining as narrative. Many miners use stranded/renewable energy.

**Layer 2 & Extensions:**
- Lightning Network: payment channels for fast, cheap BTC transactions. Growing but still niche for payments.
- Ordinals (Jan 2023): Casey Rodarmor inscribed NFTs directly on Bitcoin using witness data. Controversial. Maxis hate it ("spam"). Degens love it.
- BRC-20 tokens: fungible tokens on Bitcoin via Ordinals. Crude but functional. Created memecoin mania on BTC.
- Runes (Apr 2024): Casey Rodarmor's improved fungible token standard for Bitcoin. Launched same block as halving. Cleaner than BRC-20.
- BitVM: proposed smart contract computation on Bitcoin. Early stage.

### Price History — Key Levels

| Year | Event | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2010 | Pizza transaction (10K BTC for 2 pizzas) | $0.003 |
| 2013 | First $1,000 | $1,000 |
| 2017 | ICO bubble peak | $20,000 |
| 2018 | Bear market bottom | $3,200 |
| 2021 | Cycle ATH (Nov 10 2021) | $69,000 |
| 2022 | FTX crash bottom (Nov 2022) | $15,500 |
| 2024 | ETF-driven new ATH (Mar 2024) | $73,700 |
| 2024-25 | Continued rally, post-halving + ETF inflows | $90K-$100K+ |

**Current cycle context:**
- Post-halving (Apr 2024). Historically strongest 12-18 months after halving.
- ETF inflows providing consistent bid. Institutional money flowing in weekly.
- Macro backdrop: rate cuts, liquidity returning, risk-on sentiment.
- Key support levels CT watches: $90K, $85K, $73.7K (prior ATH as support).
- Key resistance/targets: $100K (psychological), $120K, $150K (cycle top estimates vary wildly).

### Institutional Adoption

**MicroStrategy / Strategy (Michael Saylor):**
- Largest corporate BTC holder. ~450,000+ BTC accumulated since Aug 2020.
- Saylor converted a mid-cap software company into a leveraged BTC vehicle.
- Funds purchases through convertible notes, ATM stock offerings, and operating cash flow.
- Stock ticker MSTR trades as a BTC proxy with leverage. Premium to NAV fluctuates.
- Saylor posts daily. Relentless. "Bitcoin is the apex property of the human race."
- CT loves him. Some worry about liquidation risk if BTC crashes hard enough.

**BTC Spot ETFs:**
- Approved January 10 2024 by SEC. Landmark moment.
- Key ETFs:
  - IBIT (BlackRock/iShares) — dominant by AUM. Larry Fink went from "index of money laundering" to BTC bull.
  - FBTC (Fidelity) — strong inflows, second largest.
  - ARKB (ARK Invest / 21Shares) — Cathie Wood's play.
  - GBTC (Grayscale) — converted from trust. Higher fees (1.5%). Experienced outflows initially as holders rotated to cheaper options.
  - BITB (Bitwise), HODL (VanEck), BRRR (Valkyrie), EZBC (Franklin Templeton), BTCW (WisdomTree), BTCO (Invesco).
- Combined ETF AUM surpassed gold ETFs by late 2024. Historic.
- Daily inflow/outflow data is CT's new obsession. IBIT inflows = bullish signal.

**Nation-State Adoption:**
- El Salvador: first country to adopt BTC as legal tender (Sep 7 2021). President Bukele buying regularly. "We're buying the dip" memes.
- Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: Trump floated executive order concept in 2025. Would direct Treasury to hold BTC. Debated. Some states (Texas, etc.) exploring their own reserves.
- Other countries watching. Bhutan mines BTC with hydropower.

### CT Narratives — What People Actually Talk About

**"Digital Gold" / Store of Value:**
- The dominant BTC thesis. BTC is gold but better: portable, divisible, verifiable, scarce.
- Gold market cap ~$15T. BTC market cap ~$2T. "If BTC captures X% of gold..." is the standard pitch.
- Correlation with gold has increased. Decorrelation from tech stocks debated.

**Stock-to-Flow (S2F):**
- PlanB (@100trillionUSD) model. Maps BTC price to scarcity ratio.
- Predicted $100K by end of 2021. Didn't happen on time. Model largely discredited.
- Still referenced by bulls when price catches up. "S2F was early, not wrong."
- PlanB still posts. Engagement farming with charts. CT is split on him.

**Halving Supercycle vs Diminishing Returns:**
- Bull case: each halving triggers bigger cycle. This time ETFs + institutional = supercycle.
- Bear case: diminishing returns each cycle. 2017: 20x. 2021: 3.5x. 2024+: maybe 2x?
- CT is firmly in supercycle camp until proven wrong.

**"Bitcoin Fixes This" Maximalism:**
- Maxis believe BTC is the only crypto that matters. Everything else is a scam/shitcoin.
- Laser eyes profile pics. "Stay humble, stack sats."
- Toxic maximalism is real but has softened slightly as ETH/SOL proved staying power.

**"Hyperbitcoinization":**
- BTC replaces fiat globally. Every country adopts it. Dollar collapses.
- Extreme end of bull thesis. Fun to meme about. Nobody actually models it seriously.

### Key X Accounts for BTC Sentiment

- **@saylor** — Michael Saylor. Daily BTC evangelism. Tracks MicroStrategy buys.
- **@DocumentBitcoin** — Historical BTC content. Nostalgia + education.
- **@BitcoinMagazine** — News, conference updates, maximalist leaning.

## 2. Ethereum (ETH)

### Fundamentals

- Created by Vitalik Buterin. Whitepaper 2013. Launched July 30 2015.
- Smart contract platform. Programmable money. "World computer."
- Turing-complete VM (EVM). Solidity is the primary language.
- Current supply: ~120.2M ETH. No hard cap. But net issuance is near zero or negative post-Merge.

**The Merge (Sep 15 2022):**
- Transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. Biggest upgrade in crypto history.
- Energy usage dropped 99.95% overnight.
- No more ETH mining. Validators stake 32 ETH to participate.
- Issuance dropped ~90%. From ~13,000 ETH/day (PoW) to ~1,700 ETH/day (PoS).

**EIP-1559 (Aug 2021 — London upgrade):**
- Base fee burn mechanism. Part of every transaction fee is burned (destroyed).
- When network usage is high, burn > issuance = ETH supply shrinks = deflationary.
- "Ultra sound money" meme born here. ultrasound.money tracks burn rate.
- When usage is low (bear market, L2s absorbing activity), ETH can be slightly inflationary.

**Staking:**
- ~28% of all ETH staked (~33M+ ETH).
- Staking yield: ~3-4% APR. Varies with network activity.
- Liquid staking: Lido (stETH) dominates with ~30% of staked ETH. Centralization concern.
- Other liquid staking: Rocket Pool (rETH), Coinbase (cbETH), Frax (sfrxETH).
- Restaking (EigenLayer): stake your stETH again to secure other protocols. Extra yield. Extra risk. Rehypothecation debate is real.

**Layer 2 Ecosystem:**
- ETH's scaling strategy: L1 for security/settlement, L2s for execution.
- Optimistic Rollups: Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Base (Coinbase's L2, no token).
- ZK Rollups: zkSync (ZK), Starknet (STRK), Scroll, Linea (ConsenSys), Polygon zkEVM.
- Blast: L2 with native yield. Controversial launch (locked deposits for months).
- Base is the breakout L2 of 2024-2025. Coinbase distribution + onchain culture.
- L2 TVL combined: billions. But L2s pay very little to L1 post-EIP-4844.

**Key Upgrades:**
- EIP-4844 "Dencun" (Mar 2024): Blob transactions. L2s post data to blobs instead of calldata. Dropped L2 fees 10-100x. Great for users. Bad for ETH fee burn (less revenue to L1).
- ERC-4337: Account abstraction. Smart contract wallets. Gas sponsorship. Better UX.
- Pectra (2025): Validator improvements, increased blob capacity, further EVM enhancements.

### Price History — Key Levels

| Year | Event | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2014 | ICO | $0.31 |
| 2017 | ICO bubble peak | $1,400 |
| 2018 | Bear bottom | $80 |
| 2021 | Cycle ATH (Nov 2021) | $4,878 |
| 2022 | Bear bottom (Jun 2022) | $880 |
| 2024 | ETF approval recovery | $3,500-$4,000 |

**ETH Spot ETFs:**
- Approved May 23 2024. Launched July 23 2024.
- Key ETFs: ETHA (BlackRock), FETH (Fidelity), ETHV (VanEck).
- Inflows weaker than BTC ETFs. No staking yield in ETFs (SEC restriction).
- CT narrative: "ETH ETF is underperforming because no staking. Once staking is allowed..."

### CT Narratives

**"Ultra Sound Money":**
- When burn > issuance, ETH supply decreases. Deflationary asset.
- Tracked religiously at ultrasound.money. Bat signal emoji 🦇🔊.
- Counter: post-EIP-4844, L2s pay much less to L1. Burn rate dropped. ETH has been slightly inflationary in low-activity periods.

**L2 Scaling Thesis:**
- ETH bulls: "L2s are ETH's scaling solution. Modular > monolithic."
- ETH bears: "L2s are parasitic. They take users and fees away from L1. ETH gets nothing."
- The "L2 value accrual" debate is one of the hottest in CT.

**"The Flippening":**
- ETH overtaking BTC by market cap. Hasn't happened. Felt close in 2021-2022.
- ETH/BTC ratio peaked ~0.088 (Nov 2021). Has since declined significantly.
- Declining ETH/BTC ratio is THE bear signal for ETH sentiment on CT.

**"Ethereum is Dead" / SOL Rivalry:**
- Loudest FUD of 2024-2025. Solana faster, cheaper, more retail activity.
- "Solana killed Ethereum" takes get massive engagement.
- Counter: "ETH always comes back." DeFi TVL still ETH-dominated. Institutions prefer ETH.
- This narrative flip-flops with price action. ETH pumps = "ETH is back." ETH dumps = "ETH is dead."

**Restaking Risk:**
- EigenLayer lets you restake stETH to earn more yield.
- Critics: "This is just rehypothecation. One failure cascades through the whole stack."
- Bulls: "Additional yield for the same capital. Efficient."

**DeFi Dominance:**
- ETH ecosystem still has the most DeFi TVL by far.
- Aave, Uniswap, Lido, MakerDAO, Compound, Curve — all ETH-native.
- But TVL is a lagging indicator. Activity and mindshare shifting to Solana and L2s.

### Key X Accounts for ETH Sentiment

- **@VitalikButerin** — Vitalik. Philosophical posts. Technical deep dives. CT hangs on every word.
- **@sassal0x** — Anthony Sassano. Daily ETH news. "The Daily Gwei" podcast. ETH bull.
- **@evan_van_ness** — Week in Ethereum newsletter. Comprehensive.
- **@antiprosynth** — ETH ecosystem commentary. Contrarian takes.
- **@DefiIgnas** — DeFi analyst. Yield strategies. L2 coverage.
- **@BanklessHQ** — Bankless podcast/media. ETH-aligned but covers broader crypto.
- **@christine_dkim** — Ethereum Foundation comms.
- **@ultaborowmoney** — Tracks ETH supply dynamics, burn rate.

## 3. Solana (SOL)

### Fundamentals

- Founded by Anatoly Yakovenko (ex-Qualcomm). Raj Gokal co-founder.
- Mainnet beta launched March 2020.
- High-throughput monolithic L1. Does everything on one chain. No L2 strategy.
- Theoretical TPS: ~65,000. Practical TPS: 2,000-4,000 sustained.
- Block time: 400ms. Finality: ~400ms. Feels instant.
- Transaction cost: ~$0.00025. Basically free.

**Consensus:**
- Proof of History (PoH): cryptographic clock that orders transactions before consensus.
- Combined with Tower BFT (PoS variant) and Turbine (block propagation).
- Validators: ~1,900 active. Nakamoto coefficient (decentralization measure): ~31.

**Key Infrastructure:**
- Jupiter: DEX aggregator. Largest by volume. JUP token. Jupiter team (Meow) is CT darling.
- Raydium: AMM. Core liquidity venue. RAY token.
- Orca: AMM. Concentrated liquidity. Clean UX.
- Marinade (mSOL): liquid staking protocol.
- Jito (jitoSOL): MEV-powered liquid staking. JTO token. MEV on Solana is huge business.
- Tensor: NFT marketplace. Dominant on Solana.
- Drift: Perpetuals DEX.
- Phantom: dominant wallet. Clean UX. "The MetaMask of Solana" but actually good.

**Firedancer:**
- Alternative validator client built by Jump Crypto from scratch in C/C++.
- Promises 1M+ TPS. Would make Solana absurdly fast.
- Testnet running. Mainnet rollout phased through 2025-2026.
- This is Solana's "ace in the hole" for scaling narrative.

**Token Extensions (Token-2022):**
- New token standard with built-in features: transfer fees, confidential transfers, interest-bearing tokens, permanent delegate, transfer hooks.
- Enables compliant tokens, RWAs, institutional use cases natively.

**State Compression:**
- Compressed NFTs: mint millions of NFTs for pennies using merkle trees.
- Used by DRiP (free NFT drops), gaming, loyalty programs.

### Price History — Key Levels

| Year | Event | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2020 | Launch | $0.22 |
| 2021 | Cycle ATH (Nov 2021) | $260 |
| 2022 | FTX collapse bottom (Dec 2022) | $8 |
| 2023 | Recovery begins | $8→$120 |
| 2024 | Full recovery + new highs | $120→$250+ |

**The FTX Connection:**
- Alameda Research / FTX held massive SOL positions. Sam Bankman-Fried was a Solana backer.
- When FTX collapsed (Nov 2022), SOL crashed from $35 to $8. Everyone declared it dead.
- "Solana is an FTX coin" was the dominant narrative for months.
- Recovery from $8 to $250+ is one of the greatest comeback stories in crypto history.
- FTX estate held ~$7B in locked SOL. Sold via OTC deals (Galaxy, Pantera bought at ~$64). Unlock schedule created overhang fear but market absorbed it.

### CT Narratives

**"Solana is the Nasdaq of Crypto":**
- Fast execution. Low fees. Attracts retail traders and builders.
- If BTC is gold (store of value) and ETH is bonds (yield/settlement), SOL is equities (activity/speculation).

**Memecoin Casino:**
- pump.fun launched Jan 2024. Anyone can create a token in seconds. Bonding curve mechanics.
- Created millions of tokens. Most go to zero. Some make millionaires.
- pump.fun generated $100M+ in revenue. Fastest app to $100M in crypto history.
- Solana became THE memecoin chain. BONK, WIF, POPCAT, BOME, MEW, GOAT.
- CT sentiment is split: "This is crypto's killer app — speculation" vs "This is degenerate garbage that scares normies."
- Political memecoins: TRUMP, MELANIA tokens launched Jan 2025. Massive volume. Controversial.

**SOL vs ETH — The Great Debate:**
- The defining CT argument of 2024-2025.
- SOL bulls: faster, cheaper, better UX, more retail activity, Firedancer coming.
- ETH bulls: more decentralized, more DeFi TVL, institutional preference, L2 ecosystem.
- Price action drives narrative. When SOL/ETH ratio pumps, "Solana killed Ethereum." When it dumps, "SOL is just a memecoin casino."
- Reality: both chains serve different users and will likely coexist.

**Network Outages:**
- 2022: 7+ full or partial outages. Network literally stopped producing blocks.
- "Solana is down again" was a top meme. Reliability concerns were legitimate.
- 2023-2024: significantly improved. Major outage Feb 2023 was the last big one.
- CT still brings up outages as FUD whenever convenient. Solana bulls dismiss it as "old news."

**DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks):**
- Helium: IoT/5G network migrated to Solana. HNT token.
- Hivemapper: dashcam network mapping roads. HONEY token.
- Render Network: GPU rendering. RNDR migrated to Solana.
- Grass: bandwidth sharing network.
- DePIN is a Solana-native narrative. "Real world use cases on crypto rails."

**Solana Phone:**
- Saga (gen 1): launched May 2023. Flopped at $1,000. Then BONK airdrop made it worth $2K+.
- Chapter 2: second gen phone. Preorders sold out.
- Seeker: third gen. Crypto-native mobile.

### Key X Accounts for SOL Sentiment

## 4. HYPE (Hyperliquid)

### Fundamentals

- Hyperliquid: the largest onchain perpetuals exchange by volume.
- HYPE is the native token of the Hyperliquid L1 blockchain.
- Founded by Jeff (pseudonymous). Ex-Jane Street, Harvard math.
- Team: small, mostly ex-quant. Based nowhere specific. Very secretive.

**The L1:**
- HyperBFT consensus: derived from Hotstuff. Custom-built for orderbook performance.
- Performance: 200,000 orders per second. Sub-second finality.
- Not EVM-compatible natively. HyperEVM added later as a separate execution environment.
- Runs on dedicated hardware. Validators need beefy machines.

**Architecture — Two Components:**
- **HyperCore:** The native orderbook engine. Perps, spot, vaults. This is where the magic happens. Not EVM. Purpose-built for trading.
- **HyperEVM:** General-purpose EVM environment. Smart contracts, DeFi composability. Bridged to HyperCore. Allows developers to build on top of Hyperliquid's liquidity.

**No VC Funding:**
- Zero venture capital. No seed round. No Series A. No token sale.
- Team funded it themselves. Built for 2+ years before launching token.
- 100% of tokens went to community (genesis airdrop) and team allocation.
- This matters enormously for CT sentiment. "No VCs to dump on you."

**Revenue Model:**
- Trading fees (perps + spot on HyperCore).
- HIP-1 token deployment fees (dutch auctions for ticker names).
- HIP-3 deployer fees.
- Assistance Fund (AF): protocol-owned fund that buys back HYPE with revenue. Acts as a constant bid.

**Staking:**
- HYPE staked to validators for network security.
- Staking yield from inflation + fee sharing.

### The Airdrop — Nov 29 2024

- Largest airdrop in DeFi history by dollar value.
- 31% of total HYPE supply distributed to early users based on trading activity (points system).
- Points accumulated from Nov 2023 to Nov 2024. Heavy traders got more.
- Some individual wallets received $1M+ in HYPE.
- Opened trading at ~$3.50. Rallied to $35+ within weeks. Some recipients held. Many sold immediately.
- "The airdrop that changed CT forever." Set new expectations for every future airdrop.
- Created a massive, engaged community of holders overnight.

### HIP Framework

**HIP-1: Native Token Standard**
- Hyperliquid's equivalent of ERC-20.
- Tokens deployed on HyperCore. Traded on the native orderbook.
- Ticker names allocated via dutch auction. Popular tickers cost millions of USDC.
- Every HIP-1 token gets the same orderbook infrastructure as HYPE itself. This is the key value prop.

**HIP-2: Hyperliquidity**
- Automated market making for HIP-1 tokens.
- Protocol-provided liquidity using a bonding curve mechanism.
- Ensures every HIP-1 token has baseline liquidity from day one.
- Think of it as Uniswap-style AMM but native to the orderbook.

**HIP-3: Builder-Deployed Perpetuals**
- Allows third-party builders to deploy perpetual futures on Hyperliquid.
- This is how stocks, commodities, and indices trade onchain.
- 4 Builder DEXs currently operating:
  - **xyz:** Stocks denominated in USDC. The main equities venue.
  - **flx:** Commodities denominated in USDH. Gold, silver, copper, gas, oil.
  - **vntl:** Pre-IPO markets + indices. SPACEX, STRIPE, OPENAI. Also SPY, QQQ, IWM.
  - **km:** Traditional indices + USOIL.
- All HIP-3 perps use isolated margin (not cross-margin with core perps).
- 2x native trading fees.
- Different collateral per DEX (USDC for xyz, USDH for flx, etc.).
- Builders earn fees from their deployed markets.

**HIP-4: Onchain Options & Prediction Markets (Proposed)**
- See dedicated section below.

### Price History

| Date | Event | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Nov 29 2024 | Airdrop / TGE | ~$3.50 open |
| Dec 2024 | Initial rally | $28-$35 |
| Jan-Feb 2025 | Continued price discovery | Volatile, $20-$35 range |
| Mar 2025 | JELLY incident dip | Temporary selloff |
| 2025 onwards | Building phase | Depends on adoption metrics |

**Key price dynamics:**
- No VC unlocks. No investor dumping schedule. Clean cap table.
- Team tokens vest over years. No immediate selling pressure from insiders.
- Assistance Fund constantly buying HYPE with protocol revenue. Structural bid.
- Market cap entered top 20 crypto within weeks of launch.
- Fully diluted vs circulating supply gap: watch for unlock schedule details.

### CT Narratives

**"The Future of Finance is Onchain":**
- Hyperliquid is the proof. Matching CEX-level performance with onchain transparency.
- Every trade is verifiable. No FTX-style hidden insolvency possible.
- "Why would you trade on Binance when you can trade onchain with the same speed?"

**"CEX Killer":**
- Matching or exceeding Binance perps volume on individual pairs.
- Open interest growing rapidly. $5B+ OI at peaks.
- BTC and ETH perps on Hyperliquid are genuinely competitive with centralized exchanges.
- Counter: CEXs still have more pairs, fiat on-ramps, and normie UX.

**Jeff — The Mysterious Founder:**
- Almost never posts publicly. @chameleon_jeff is rumored to be him.
- Ex-Jane Street trader. Harvard math background.
- CT loves the mystique. "Jeff doesn't need to shill. The product shills itself."
- Contrast with other founders who are constantly on podcasts.

**Point Farming Meta:**
- Nov 2023 - Nov 2024: users traded massive volume to accumulate points.
- Wash trading concerns. Some users ran bots to maximize points.
- Created a culture of "farm and dump" that Hyperliquid transcended because the product was actually good.

**JELLY Incident (Mar 2025):**
- Short squeeze exploit on JELLYJELLY token.
- Attacker created a massive short position, then pumped the price to liquidate themselves.
- Hyperliquid's liquidation engine struggled. Vault (HLP) took losses.
- Protocol intervened by delisting the market. Controversial — "decentralized but they can delist?"
- Tested community confidence. Price dipped but recovered.
- Led to risk parameter improvements and better safeguards.

**HyperEVM Ecosystem:**
- New DeFi protocols building on HyperEVM:
  - HyperLend (lending)
  - Hypersurface (options / structured products)
  - KittenSwap (AMM on HyperEVM)
  - Felix (stablecoin protocol → USDH)
  - Various yield vaults and automated strategies
- "HyperEVM season" is anticipated. New token launches, airdrops from protocols building on HL.

### Key X Accounts for HYPE Sentiment

- **@HyperliquidX** — Official account. Product updates, stats.
- **@chameleon_jeff** — Rumored Jeff account. Rarely posts. When he does, CT goes wild.
- **@HyperFnd** — Hyper Foundation. Grants, ecosystem development.
- **@xaborow** — Hyperliquid community aggregator accounts.
- **@pvaborowHL** — Various prominent Hyperliquid community members.
- **Telegram/Discord** — Hyperliquid community is very active in private groups.

## 5. HIP-4: Onchain Options & Prediction Markets (Proposed)

> **Status as of Feb 2026:** Community proposal/discussion. NOT officially published in Hyperliquid docs. No confirmed timeline.

### What HIP-4 Would Be

- Native options and prediction markets on the Hyperliquid L1.
- Would complement the existing stack: HIP-1 (spot tokens) + HIP-2 (liquidity) + HIP-3 (perps) + HIP-4 (options/predictions).
- Uses the same orderbook infrastructure that handles 200K orders/sec.

### Potential Features

- **European-style options** on any HIP-1 asset.
- **Binary options / prediction markets** — similar to Polymarket but onchain on Hyperliquid.
- **Same matching engine** as perps. No separate system needed.
- **Integration with Hypersurface** for automated market making (covered calls, secured puts).
- **Cash-settled** in USDC or USDH.

### Why It Matters

**Options are the last major TradFi primitive not onchain at scale:**
- Spot: done (DEXs everywhere).
- Perps: done (Hyperliquid, dYdX, GMX).
- Options: still mostly offchain. Deribit dominates crypto options. No onchain competitor at scale.
- Traditional options market is $600T+ notional. Crypto options barely scratched the surface.

**Polymarket proved prediction market demand:**
- $3.2B+ traded on Polymarket in 2024 (mostly US election).
- Demonstrated massive appetite for binary outcome betting.
- But Polymarket is a standalone app. Integrating into Hyperliquid = composability with all other HL primitives.

**Completes the Hyperliquid financial stack:**
- Spot (HIP-1) + Perps (HIP-3) + Options (HIP-4) = complete financial system.
- Add stocks/commodities via HIP-3 builders = onchain everything.
- "Why do we need Wall Street?" is the endgame narrative.

**Hypersurface connection:**
- Hypersurface already runs covered calls and secured puts on Hyperliquid.
- Native options infrastructure would make these strategies more capital efficient.
- Eliminates need for separate options infrastructure.

### Current State

- Community discussion phase. Various proposals floating around.
- No official HIP-4 document published by Hyperliquid team.
- Jeff has not publicly commented on options roadmap.
- Hypersurface operations suggest the team is thinking about it.
- Could be announced at any time. Could be years away. Unknown.

### Relevance to VINCE Stack

- Solus (VINCE's AI agent) already runs Hypersurface options strategies.
- Native HL options would eliminate need for separate infrastructure.
- Would allow more sophisticated automated trading strategies.

### km DEX (Traditional Indices + Oil)

- Traditional market indices
- USOIL

### HIP-3 Trading Notes

- **Isolated margin only.** HIP-3 positions don't share margin with core perps.
- **2x native fees.** Trading HIP-3 markets costs twice what trading BTC-PERP costs.
- **Different collateral per DEX.** xyz uses USDC. flx uses USDH. Cannot cross-collateralize.
- **Hours:** Stock perps trade 24/7 (unlike TradFi). Price discovery happens outside market hours. Gaps at market open are a trading opportunity.
- **Settlement:** All cash-settled perpetuals. No physical delivery. Index price from oracles.
- **Pre-IPO markets:** Pure speculation on private company valuations. No official price feed. Community-driven price discovery. Extremely volatile.

### Why Onchain Stocks Matter for Sentiment

- Bridges TradFi and DeFi narratives. When NVDA earnings happen, it's now a Hyperliquid event too.
- Attracts TradFi-curious crypto users and crypto-curious stock traders.
- XYZ100 index = a single asset tracking the broader stock market onchain.
- MSTR perp is meta: trading a stock that holds BTC, as a perp on a crypto exchange.
- Pre-IPO markets (SPACEX, OPENAI) generate huge buzz. "Trade SpaceX before it IPOs."

## ECHO Cross-Asset Sentiment Framework

How to read sentiment across BTC, ETH, SOL, HYPE, and onchain stocks as a unified system.

### The Sentiment Hierarchy

**BTC leads. Everything else follows.**
- BTC pumps → risk-on → ETH, SOL, HYPE all benefit.
- BTC dumps → risk-off → everything dumps harder (high-beta assets like SOL/HYPE dump 2-3x BTC's move).
- BTC chops sideways → altcoins get their own narratives. This is when ETH/SOL/HYPE can decouple.

### Key Ratios to Monitor

**ETH/BTC ratio:**
- Rising = "alt season approaching," ETH outperforming, risk appetite increasing.
- Falling = BTC dominance rising, capital rotating to safety, bear signal for alts.
- CT obsesses over this. Threads about ETH/BTC ratio get massive engagement.

**SOL/ETH ratio:**
- Rising = "Solana flipping Ethereum" narrative strengthens. Memecoin/retail activity surging.
- Falling = "ETH is back" narrative. Institutional rotation. Quality over degen.
- This ratio is the single best measure of retail vs institutional sentiment.

**HYPE/SOL ratio:**
- Rising = DeFi innovation narrative > memecoin narrative. Smart money positioning.
- Falling = memecoin casino > infrastructure plays. Pure degen mode.

**BTC dominance (BTC.D):**
- BTC.D rising = money flowing to BTC, away from alts. Risk-off within crypto.
- BTC.D falling = alt season. Money rotating from BTC into alts. Risk-on.
- Typical cycle: BTC leads → BTC.D peaks → money rotates to ETH → then to SOL/alts → then to micro caps → cycle ends.

### Sentiment Signals by Asset

**BTC Sentiment Tells:**
- ETF inflow/outflow data (daily, from IBIT/FBTC/etc.) — positive inflows = institutional confidence.
- MicroStrategy buying announcements — Saylor buying = CT euphoria.
- Miner selling/holding — miners selling = need cash = bearish. Miners holding = bullish.
- Funding rates on perps — positive = longs paying shorts = crowded long. Negative = shorts paying longs = bearish positioning.
- Fear & Greed Index — CT memes this but it actually correlates.

**ETH Sentiment Tells:**
- ETH/BTC ratio direction — THE indicator for ETH CT mood.
- L2 activity (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism daily active addresses) — L2 growth = ETH ecosystem health.
- ETH burn rate (ultrasound.money) — high burn = bullish narrative fuel. Low burn = "ETH is dead" fuel.
- Restaking TVL (EigenLayer) — growing = confidence. Shrinking = risk-off.
- Vitalik posting about roadmap = CT attention spike.

**SOL Sentiment Tells:**
- pump.fun daily token launches and volume — high = degen activity strong.
- Jupiter volume — aggregated DEX volume reflects real usage.
- Memecoin launches hitting CT timeline — when normies are posting PnL screenshots, sentiment is peak.
- Network uptime — any outage = instant FUD wave.
- FTX estate SOL movements — any transfer to exchanges triggers fear.

**HYPE Sentiment Tells:**
- Hyperliquid 24h trading volume — growing volume = growing relevance.
- Open interest — rising OI = more positions = more engagement.
- HIP-1 token auction prices — expensive auctions = builders want to launch on HL = bullish.
- HyperEVM protocol launches — new DeFi = ecosystem growth.
- Jeff posting (rare) — any @chameleon_jeff activity = CT goes crazy.
- Assistance Fund HYPE purchases — protocol buying back = structural demand.
- Vault (HLP) performance — positive returns = confidence. Losses (like JELLY) = fear.

**Onchain Stocks Sentiment Tells:**
- Volume on xyz/flx/vntl/km DEXs — growing = HIP-3 adoption.
- Pre-IPO price movements (SPACEX, OPENAI) — reflect speculative appetite.
- Stock perp vs TradFi price convergence — tight spreads = mature market. Wide spreads = early/illiquid.
- Earnings season activity — do crypto users care about NVDA earnings on Hyperliquid? Growing engagement = bullish for convergence thesis.

### Cross-Asset Sentiment Patterns

**Full Risk-On (Bull Market):**
- BTC making new highs. ETH/BTC ratio rising. SOL outperforming ETH. HYPE volume surging.
- Memecoins going parabolic. Onchain stock volume growing. Funding rates positive everywhere.
- CT mood: euphoric. "We're all gonna make it." "This is just the beginning."
- Danger zone: this is usually near the top.

**Risk-Off Rotation (Early Bear):**
- BTC holds relatively well. ETH/BTC ratio dropping. SOL dumping hard. HYPE volume declining.
- Memecoins dying. NFT volume dead. Funding rates negative.
- CT mood: "I'm just DCAing BTC." "Altcoins are scams." BTC maximalism rises.
- Money flows: alts → BTC → stablecoins → off-ramp.

**Alt Season (Mid-Cycle Rotation):**
- BTC consolidating after a run. BTC.D falling.
- ETH pumping. SOL pumping harder. HYPE and ecosystem tokens pumping hardest.
- New narratives emerge (DePIN, AI, RWA, whatever is next).
- CT mood: "BTC is boring. I'm 100% alts." This is the most fun phase.
- Window is usually 4-8 weeks. Timing matters enormously.

**Capitulation (Bear Market Bottom):**
- Everything down 70-90% from highs. Volume dead. CT engagement lowest.
- "Crypto is dead" mainstream articles. Builders keep building quietly.
- Funding rates negative. Shorts overcrowded.
- CT mood: depression. "I should have sold." "Maybe next cycle."
- This is historically the best time to buy. But it doesn't feel like it.

### How ECHO Should Use This

1. **Read the room across all 4 assets simultaneously.** Don't just track BTC. The ratios between assets tell you more than any single price.

2. **CT sentiment is a leading indicator for small caps, lagging for BTC.** By the time CT is euphoric about BTC, the move is mostly done. By the time CT discovers a memecoin, it might still have 10x left (or it might rug).

3. **Volume > Price.** A price move on low volume is suspect. A price move on high volume is real. Track Hyperliquid volume, DEX volume, ETF flows.

4. **Narrative shifts happen fast.** "ETH is dead" can flip to "ETH is back" in 48 hours with a 15% pump. Don't anchor to yesterday's narrative.

5. **Watch what smart money does, not what CT says.** Whale wallet movements, ETF flows, Hyperliquid large positions — these matter more than Twitter threads with 10K likes.

6. **Onchain stocks are the bridge.** When NVDA earnings move Hyperliquid NVDA-PERP, that's TradFi sentiment bleeding into crypto. Track this convergence.

7. **Memecoin activity is the retail thermometer.** High pump.fun volume = retail is engaged and speculating. Low volume = retail has left. This affects all risk assets.

8. **HYPE is the infrastructure bet.** If you're bullish on onchain trading growing, HYPE captures that. It's a pick-and-shovel play on the entire degen economy.
