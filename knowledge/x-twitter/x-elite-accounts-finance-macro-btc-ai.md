## Follow Strategy for OGs

You joined in 2007. Your account has weight — algorithmic and social. Here's how to use it:

### Feed Architecture
1. **Create Lists, don't just follow.** Your main timeline will be noise. Build private lists:
   - `macro-pulse` — DeItaone, financialjuice, ForexLive, LiveSquawk (speed)
   - `macro-brain` — Lyn Alden, MacroAlf, Raoul Pal, Luke Gromen, Jim Bianco (analysis)
   - `btc-onchain` — glassnode, Checkmate, Will Clemente, ki_young_ju, HODL15Capital
   - `crypto-alpha` — Arthur Hayes, Cobie, DefiIgnas, tier10k, shawmakesmagic
   - `ai-builders` — Karpathy, Chollet, Mollick, simonw, swyx
   - `vol-options` — SqueezeMetrics, SpotGamma, Cem Karsan
   - `contrarian` — NorthmanTrader, TheLastBearSta1, sentimentrader

2. **Mute aggressively.** Mute words: "gm", "wagmi", "like and retweet", "thread 🧵" (yes really), "alpha leak."

3. **Use your OG status.** 2007 accounts get higher algorithmic weight. Your likes boost visibility. Like strategically — it shapes what you see.

4. **Rotate attention by market regime:**
   - Risk-on: weight crypto + growth stocks lists
   - Risk-off: weight macro + vol + contrarian lists
   - Transition: weight cross-domain power follows

5. **Weekly ritual:** Every Sunday, spend 30 min on the `macro-brain` list. Read the long threads you bookmarked during the week. This is where edge compounds.

### What NOT to Do
- Don't follow 5,000 accounts. Signal dies above ~500.
- Don't engage with rage-bait. It poisons your algo feed.
- Don't confuse follower count with signal quality. Some of the best follows here have <100K.

## ECHO Integration

How ECHO (Chief Sentiment Officer) should use these accounts for multi-domain sentiment analysis:

### Tier 1: Real-Time Pulse (check every 15 min during market hours)
- @DeItaone, @financialjuice, @LiveSquawk — breaking macro data
- @tier10k, @WuBlockchain — breaking crypto news
- @unusual_whales, @SqueezeMetrics — options flow shifts

### Tier 2: Sentiment Gauges (check hourly)
- @NorthmanTrader — when he goes quiet or bullish, regime change signal
- @sentimentrader — quant sentiment data
- @KobeissiLetter — retail sentiment proxy (what normies are reading)
- @inversebrah — CT sentiment (degen confidence index)
- @TheLastBearSta1 — bear capitulation signal

### Tier 3: Narrative Detection (check 2-4x daily)
- @RaoulGMI, @balajis — macro narrative shifts
- @CryptoHayes — crypto macro thesis changes
- @karpathy, @emollick — AI capability narrative
- @shawmakesmagic — AI x crypto narrative
- @VitalikButerin — Ethereum/governance narrative

### Tier 4: Deep Analysis (daily digest)
- @LynAldenContact, @LukeGromen — macro framework updates
- @_Checkmatey_, @WClementeIII — on-chain regime analysis
- @MacroAlf — rates/macro educational context
- @MattLevine — financial structure/deal analysis

### Cross-Signal Detection
ECHO should flag when:
- Macro accounts AND crypto accounts align on a directional call (convergence = high conviction)
- Vol accounts show unusual positioning while headline feeds are quiet (divergence = something brewing)
- AI narrative accounts shift from "amazing demos" to "scaling concerns" or vice versa (inflection)
- Bear accounts go silent or flip bullish (capitulation signal)
- Multiple cross-domain accounts tweet about the same topic within hours (narrative emergence)

### Sentiment Scoring
For each domain, ECHO should maintain a rolling sentiment score:
- **Macro sentiment:** weighted average of Tier 1-3 macro accounts
- **Crypto sentiment:** on-chain data accounts + CT culture accounts
- **AI sentiment:** researcher accounts + industry commentary
- **Vol/risk sentiment:** options flow accounts + contrarian indicators
- **Cross-domain conviction:** when 3+ domains align directionally
