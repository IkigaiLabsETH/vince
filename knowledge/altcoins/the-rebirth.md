Look, it’s Christmas Eve 2025—December 24, if you can believe we’re still kicking in this madhouse—and here I am, staring at my screen, the glow reflecting off a half-empty glass of 1er grand cru Chablis that’s probably too fancy for this bullshit. Ffs, it’s Christmas, so I splurged—crisp, mineral-sharp white from Burgundy, cutting through the holiday haze like a knife. 

But even this liquid gold can’t wash away the taste of the crypto carnage unfolding. Doomscrolling X, and bam, Binance’s main account tweeting, “What’s a 10/10 chart?” with that smug little emoji. Fucking crazy, right? 

## Context

The community erupts—folks calling it open mockery after the mass liquidations, those impossible price swings, and zero accountability from the exchange giants. You know, the ones where thousands got wiped out in forced sells, real money vanishing like smoke. And Binance just posts this, acting untouchable, like we’re all exit liquidity for their games. If that doesn’t enrage you, you’re asleep—or maybe just numb after 21 years of this circus, like me. 

It screams contempt, especially tying back to that October 10 “black swan” crash where $19.3 billion in positions got nuked amid a Binance glitch that depegged stablecoins to $0.65. “10/10 chart”? Yeah, probably a jab at the perfect storm of a dump. Broken space, indeed. We’ve been here before, you and me, grinding through these cycles that feel eternal. But here’s the thing: this ongoing bloodbath isn’t some random apocalypse or just retail bailing. It’s the usual suspects—leverage gone wild, funding rates screwing everyone over—and honestly, it might be the enema the market needs before anything real sticks.
**
I swear, I’ve been ranting about this crap online for way too long, back when “crypto” was just some cypherpunk fever dream. We’re still lurking, masochists forever. It’s the leveraged cowboys turning ripples into tsunamis, amplified by exchanges like Binance that glitch out and then meme about it.

So, let’s unpack this mess, shall we? Perpetual futures—those never-ending bets where traders YOLO on price swings with borrowed cash. Leverage? Turns your $1k into a $10k gamble, because sanity’s overrated. 

## Main

Funding rates keep it “fair”: longs pay shorts when bulls overcrowd, signaling a powder keg. And yeah, leading into this holiday hell, rates got positive in pockets—BTC holding around +0.015% before slips—piling on the fragility. 

Not screaming aggressive everywhere today, but the buildup from Q4, especially post that Oct 10 nightmare, set the trap.

Then, a dip hits, and cascade city. 

Exchanges force-close the overleveraged, dumping more sell pressure. 

Stops pop, spot holders freak late, loop repeats. 

Data’s brutal: Open interest tanked 30% lately, deepest deleveraging this cycle.

ETH OI halved on Binance, from highs to about $6B. 

Liquidations? **

$600M on Monday alone, $250M yesterday ahead of GDP data, another $144M wipeout recently—BTC eating $65-75M in one go as it dipped below $85k. 

**Spot buyers? **

MIA, thin books turning drops into craters. 

X analysts howling: “Binance dumping hundreds of millions in BTC, buying back after liquidating $100M+ longs—pure manipulation.”

But wait, macro’s the uninvited guest crashing the party. 

Rates high—U.S. yields up, global borrowing a pain—stifling the fun. 

Fed ended QT, cut rates to 3.5%-3.75% mid-month, but liquidity’s a slow drip. 

Risk-off: Cash flows to BTC or fiat, altcoins left as the ultimate gamblers’ bet. 

**Stablecoin DeFi yields? **

Down to 3%, less lending, less leverage. 

ETFs and treasuries strained, small ones dumping amid NAV meltdowns.

Institutions hug the safe stuff: BTC, ETH, SOL, .... 

Small-caps? Down 40% syncing with majors’ milder 12-13% hits.

**Hedge funds? **

Bleeding out, worst since ‘22—volatility sparking redemptions, more forced sells. 

BTC funding cautious at positive but tempered levels. 

Wintermute’s report nails it: Altseason dead, BTC dominance soaring, markets consolidating after ETH breached $3k. 

**Arthur Hayes? **

Calls alts “sickly” but dumpster-dive worthy post-purge. 

Kind of wild, right? 

I laughed—bitterly—reading that. 

Could be wrong; markets love flipping scripts.
**
Here’s the twist that feels like copium sometimes: This purge? Kinda necessary. Or at least, not pure doom. Leverage-bloated, no real upside—everyone long, setups for implosions. Flush the weak hands, reset. History whispers deep OI drops signal bottoms, resilient cash builds back. 

Alt Season Index? **

In the gutter, far from 75% outperformance vs. BTC. 
**
Only 3% of Binance alts above 200-day MAs—capitulation zone, not endless abyss. Liquidity returns—post-QT, more cuts?—capital rotates, survivors like ETH, SOL shine. Projects with ETFs, low emissions, yields? They’ll eat. 

Critics scream tokenomics trash or scams—valid, plenty out there—but core

Leverage slams into macro walls. 

Shorts stacking could ignite squeezes. 

It’s exhausting. **

Total cap slipped 1.1% today to $3.02T, alts down 36% since early Oct, BTC off 7% YTD, ETH similar. But this isn’t random or retail flight—it’s leverage cascades, macro squeezes, exchanges like Binance grinning through the chaos. 

The purge clears decks for growth, maybe. 

Cycles brutal, rewarding the patient—or lucky.

Wrapping as my Chablis warms: Next time a tweet like that hits your feed mid-dip, try this dumb thing—close the app, hold spot instead of leveraging up. 

**TL;DR: Altcoin Bloodbath Explained**

In December 2025, altcoins (e.g., ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP) have plunged 36% since October, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 7% YTD drop, amid a “bloodbath” driven not by retail exodus but by excessive leverage in derivatives markets. Overcrowded long positions led to positive funding rates, massive open interest drops (e.g., ETH OI halved), and liquidation cascades totaling hundreds of millions, amplified by macro headwinds like high interest rates and liquidity droughts.

This painful deleveraging flushes out speculation, resetting the market for sustainable growth—historical patterns suggest it’s a bottom signal, paving the way for a potential 2026 rebound as liquidity returns and resilient projects thrive. Lesson: Avoid overleveraged bets; pain often precedes crypto progress.

See if rage fades. 

## Conclusion

Tell me if it works—or if I’m full of shit. 

We’re in the trenches together, after all.
