## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs


While the market is uncertain and major alts are close to the cycle lows, it’s a perfect time to evaluate the revenue pricing of Revenue Meta projects.
TL;DR
Buyback revenue is generally more expensive than direct fee sharing (except $PUMP)
Owning $1 of tokens in $CRV, $AERO, $PENDLE, or $YB earns up to 3-7x yield vs. average buybacks
The $UNI revenue is 28 times more expensive than $CRV and 74 times more expensive than $AERO.
In this research, we provide a revenue pricing analysis through the lens of Effective Revenue Multipliers applied to the selected set of tokens.
Revenue pricing overview
The table below shows how multipliers reflect the cashflow received by token holders in recent periods, accordingly to the current market price.
https://app.valueverse.ai/research/value-state-003-valuing-cashflow-without-narratives
Other revenue meta tokens:
$PENDLE 2.76 7D, 3.77 365D
$UNI: 133x 7D, 179x 365D*
Meaning:
7-180D multiplier reflects annualization of recent revenue distribution period
365D multiplier reflects historical revenue during past year to date
* Reflects the yearly average, calculated using annualization for the longest available revenue period (for projects with a revenue period of less than 365 days)
Multiplier indicates the assessment price of $1 of revenue in the future year period (under the simple linear annualisation).

Cashflow Composition & Pricing Exploration
@CurveFinance ($CRV)
$CRV receives two sources of revenue being locked in veCRV:
Admin fee, unconditionally
Bribes, requires voting (average bribe income accounted)
Recent epoch (incl. ATH in bribes since Aug 2025) drives quite low multipliers vs. previous periods:
Latest epoch vs. previous epochs highlighted for $veCRV, https://app.valueverse.ai/tokens/curve-dao
The cumulative 7D one, assuming veCRV holder receives fees+bribe income is 4.35x; with annual average of ~6.4x.
@yieldbasis ($YB):
The Yield Basis token locked in veYB provides its holders with fees only (bribes are available, however not provided by anyone yet):
$veYB fee distribution, https://dune.com/valueverse/yb-valueverse
The 7D 10.8x, 30D 6x multipliers reflects the decline in revenue during the recent period of low volatility (compared to November and December of 2025)
Annualized revenue for 365D* shows a 1.33x multiplier
@AerodromeFi ($AERO):
Aerodrome has four sources of revenue.
We accounted for veAERO proceeds separately (fees, bribes, rebase, and buybacks), veAERO proceeds outside of buybacks, veAERO claimable cashflow (fees and bribes), and buybacks.
Claimable yield (fees + bribes) accounts for the majority of the cash flow available to token holders:
$veAERO revenue sources, https://app.valueverse.ai/tokens/aerodrome-finance
Buybacks account for only $26.5 million since launch in 2024, while veAERO holders have earned an annualized income of ~$184 million to date.
Summary: 7D 3.87x, claimable cashflow is 4.52x, 365D of 2.41x (7D and annual accounts include all cashflow sources, including buybacks).
@VelodromeFi ($VELO): has the similar structure to $AERO with with an exception for buybacks; ~6.5x 7D and ~3x annual multiplier.
@Pumpfun ($PUMP):
Pump.fun has only one revenue source - buybacks, affecting the entire holders’ m.cap.
Pump.fun spent huge amounts for buyback resulting in ~20.73% of supply reduction (1.26 supply reduction index, reflecting relative value growth for token holders since TGE):
However, it is still traded significantly below TGE price with quite low multipliers - 2.85 7D, 4.31 365D*.
@HyperliquidX ($HYPE):
For $HYPE, we track four sources of revenue: buybacks, HYPE staking, HypeEVM, and HypeCORE $HYPE burn. However, buybacks account for the majority of revenue for token holders (~$726 million spent since March 20, 2025):
https://app.valueverse.ai/tokens/hyperliquid
Compared to AMM DEXes (e.g., $CRV and $AERO), $HYPE trades at a valuation that is 3-4 times higher than that of the aforementioned projects (~14-16x multiplier in various periods).
@aave ($AAVE):
$AAVE has two revenue sources: buybacks and staking in the AAVE Safety Module, the latter of which is becoming a legacy token function and will be replaced by another solution.
However, we must account for this source, as 2.5 million $AAVE (15.65%) remains in the Safety Module, earning 3.79% of stkAAVE revenue.
https://app.valueverse.ai/tokens/aave
The amount spent on $AAVE buybacks is approximately $36.6 million, resulting in 1.05% of the supply being bought back (compare this with the 15% of the supply earning 3.77% APY).
Of course, $stkAAVE earns revenue from emissions. However, for token holders, it is a more tangible and substantial source of revenue:
Buybacks have an 88x 7D multiplier, while stkAAVE has a 23x 7D multiplier.
The overall 7D multiplier is 18.47, which accounts for the most valuable option for token holders—staking in stkAAVE (+ automatically receiving buybacks, affecting all token holders).
Without stkAAVE, the annual multiplier for would be ~75x, which is roughly 5x times more expensive than $HYPE.
@pendle_fi $PENDLE & @Uniswap $UNI
Pendle has a revenue distribution model for token holders that is now transitioning to a new model. We are tracking the current results: 3.77x 365D, is a top performing result in DeFi alongside with other ve models.
However, Uniswap buybacks are quite small compared to its market cap, as reflected in 133x 7D and 179x 365D*, meaning it is the most expensive token in our observations.
It means that $UNI is 28x more expensive (in terms of revenue pricing) than $CRV and 74x more expensive than $AERO.
What can we learn from Effective Multipliers tracking
The Revenue Meta has two types of tokens: direct fee-sharing and buyback.
Buyback valuations are always higher than direct fee-sharing ones, except for $PUMP:
This means that token holders receive much less revenue for every $1 of revenue-eligible supply.
Notably, they receive only an "indirect revenue share" in terms of supply decrements, with no tangible, claimable yield.
Without staking $AAVE in legacy Safety Module, the AAVE multiplier would be ~75x. However, Uniswap buybacks drive the valuation up to ~179x annually.
In contrast, direct revenue-sharing tokens, such as $CRV, $YB, and $AERO, have much lower multipliers and provide a claimable yield for token holders.
What if the next stage of Revenue Meta will be driven by direct fee share models?
