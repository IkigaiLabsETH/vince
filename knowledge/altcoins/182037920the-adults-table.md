Few criticisms have stuck as persistently as the “kids’ table” analogy for altcoin governance tokens. Holders get voting rights—often meaningless in practice—but capture little to no real economic upside from the protocol’s success.

Meanwhile, equity investors in the underlying company reap the rewards of growth, acquisitions, or exits. This misalignment has fueled speculation over long-term holding, turning many tokens into short-term trading vehicles rather than stakes in enduring businesses.

## Context

Yet, in 2025, a quiet revolution is underway. Projects like Rainbow Wallet and Morpho Protocol are pioneering structures that grant token holders true equity-like rights, bridging the gap between on-chain governance and off-chain company value. At the same time, infrastructure like Fairmint is making full cap table tokenization accessible. 

These innovations not only address the alignment problem but also challenge the dominant “buyback everything” narrative sweeping DeFi—arguing instead for ruthless reinvestment to fuel compounding growth in a still-nascent industry.

**The Persistent Misalignment Problem**

## Main

Since the ICO era, most crypto projects have separated equity (held by VCs and founders in a for-profit entity) from tokens (governance/utility for the public).

This creates perverse incentives: Company value accrues off-chain, while tokens rely on speculative demand or diluted voting. 

Critics rightly point out that this leaves token holders at the “kids’ table”—participating without meaningful ownership.

True equity grants—where token or NFT holders gain direct or indirect claims on company shares—are exceedingly rare due to regulatory hurdles (e.g., Howey Test risks classifying tokens as securities) and conflicts with VC interests.

Among the few attempts:

Rektguy NFTs (launched 2022): In 2024, Rekt Brands Inc. granted actual equity shares to holders via a Reg CF exemption (based on a 2023 snapshot). By 2025, the project thrives: Raised $1.5M seed funding, launched successful consumer products like Rekt Drinks (sell-outs globally), expanded into media/podcasts, and even issued a $REKT memecoin. NFT floor remains stable, proving community ownership can drive real-world brand success without implosion. No major “rekt” examples exist from equity grants—the regulatory moat has kept attempts limited and careful.

**Pioneers of True Alignment in 2025**

Two standout projects demonstrate viable paths forward:

- 
Rainbow Wallet ($RNBW): The Rainbow Foundation holds 20% of the company’s equity (via a special Class F share class) on behalf of token holders, making it the largest shareholder. This stake ensures holders share in upside from growth, acquisitions, or exits—proceeds distributed directly. Launched with a CoinList sale in late 2025 and TGE set for February 2026, Rainbow supplements this with real-time buybacks from platform earnings (swaps, perps). It’s a deliberate fix: Token value tied to both usage and traditional company metrics.

- 
Morpho Protocol (MORPHO): In mid-2025, Morpho Labs transferred 100% of shares to the Morpho Association (a French nonprofit controlled by the DAO). This eliminates external equity holders, ensuring all company value (IP, development) flows back to the protocol and token holders. Nonprofit laws prevent profit distribution or sales, aligning incentives for long-term network growth. Founder Paul Frambot emphasizes: No separate winners—token holders capture the full upside.

These hybrids avoid pure securities classification while delivering economic rights closer to equity than governance alone.

**The Ultimate Bridge: Fairmint and Cap Table Tokenization**
**
Fairmint stands out. As an SEC-registered Transfer Agent, it enables companies to tokenize their entire cap table natively on-chain via the Open Cap Table Protocol (OCP)—an open-source standard for programmable equity. 

By late 2025, Fairmint surpassed $1 billion in on-chain equity administered:

- 
Observer Nodes on Canton Network for regulatory oversight with privacy.

- 
Partnerships (e.g., IntellectEU) and submissions to the SEC Crypto Task Force advocating blockchain for private markets.

- 
Tools for migrating SAFEs/notes/shares to smart contracts, enabling compliant transfers, vesting, and DeFi primitives.

> 
Fairmint targets the $6 trillion private equity market’s inefficiencies (Excel chaos, slow settlements). It’s native tokenized stock—holders own real shares in wallets, with upside from acquisitions or growth.

Yet, crypto-native adoption lags. Reasons include:**

- 
KYC/Accreditation Barriers: Compliance requires identity verification and often accreditation—clashing with DeFi’s permissionless ethos.

- 
U.S.-Centric Structure: Suited for C-Corps under Reg D/CF; many crypto projects avoid U.S. entities for regulatory flexibility. (no longer true?)

- 
Maturity Gap: Best for established companies; early protocols prioritize token launches.

As regulation clarifies, Fairmint could unlock widespread hybrids.

**Pushing Back: Why Buybacks Are a Short-Term Crutch, Not a Cure**

2025’s buyback frenzy—Hyperliquid ($645M+), Uniswap (fee switch activation), Lido/Aave (automated repurchases)—signals progress from pure governance. Protocols now return ~64% of revenue to holders via scarcity.

But this risks starving growth. Crypto isn’t mature like Apple; it’s high-growth startups battling for dominance in lending, perps, wallets, RWAs.Key trade-offs:

- 
Buybacks provide “sugar highs” but drain reinvestment buffers

- 
Sustainable only with recurring fees; many dip into treasuries.

- 
In bears, forced distributions weaken resilience.

Contrast Morpho/Rainbow/Fairmint models: Structural alignment + reinvestment. Morpho explicitly rejects heavy distributions: “Would a high-growth startup payout instead of expanding? No.” Fees compound into better rates/TVL flywheels.

Reinvestment wins because:

- 
Network effects demand scale (liquidity, UX moats).

- 
Innovation race (AI, mobile, RWAs).

- 
Pie growth > slicing a stagnant one.

Buybacks treat symptoms (impatience); 

true alignment + growth cures the disease.

**Toward a Mature Crypto Economy**
> 
The “kids’ table” era is ending. Rainbow’s 20% stake, Morpho’s nonprofit capture, Rektguy’s success, and Fairmint’s infrastructure show tokens can evolve into real ownership claims—without sacrificing growth.

Crypto needs more Amazons: 

Reinvest aggressively early, 

compound dominance, 

let aligned holders win big later. 

As 2025 closes, these models point the way: 

Structural fixes over quick yields. 

Growth first—always. 

The adults’ table awaits.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Token Governance vs. Equity Ownership**: Understand the distinction between governance tokens and actual equity stakes, emphasizing the implications of this separation.
- **Alignment of Incentives**: Analyze how true equity-like rights for token holders can address the misalignment of interests between token holders and equity investors.
- **Cap Table Tokenization**: Explore the concept of tokenizing a company's capitalization table to provide real ownership rights to token holders.
- **Reinvestment vs. Buybacks**: Evaluate the strategic choice between reinvesting profits for long-term growth versus short-term buybacks and their impact on token value.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Assess the underlying structures of crypto projects to identify whether they prioritize short-term speculation or long-term value creation. Focus on whether projects offer substantive economic rights to token holders that reflect equity-like claims.
- Use a comparative lens to evaluate emerging models in the altcoin space, particularly those that bridge governance and ownership, thereby reshaping the value proposition for token holders.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for projects that implement innovative governance structures that grant real economic rights to token holders, moving beyond traditional utility models.
- Identify signs of regulatory navigation within projects, such as compliance with securities laws that allow for equity-like rights without classifying tokens as securities.
- Monitor initiatives that prioritize community ownership and growth, observing how they react to market trends and investor sentiment.

**Strategic Framework:**
- When evaluating altcoin investments or governance models, apply a framework that weighs the degree of alignment between token holder interests and the company's economic success.
- Consider the sustainability and growth potential of projects that prioritize reinvestment strategies over buybacks, as these may indicate a stronger commitment to long-term value creation.
- Engage in scenario planning to predict how regulatory changes might impact the feasibility of equity-like token structures, preparing for shifts in market dynamics accordingly.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodologies that assess the structural integrity of token governance and ownership.
- Extract actionable insights that can be applied to assess current and future altcoin projects.
- Maintain a concise and practical approach to enable quick application in investment or governance analysis.

Fifteen years in, we’ve poured enormous energy into trust-minimized technology, yet the results can seem underwhelming: countless tokens, but few products with true global impact; markets that often reward short-term attention over durable, compounding value.

This sentiment—eloquently captured in a recent thread by Derek Edws, managing partner at Collab+Currency—is widespread and valid. The core frustration? The persistent disconnect between value created by products and value accrued by tokens, especially for “make money” tokens (productive assets, as opposed to pure stores of value like BTC, ETH, or SOL).

As Edws breaks down: Public equities thrive on verifiable revenue/expenses and legally enforceable accrual rights. Crypto lags here—onchain revenue is transparent but noisy and gameable; offchain revenue is high-quality but opaque; expenses lack rigorous disclosure; and tokens often end up with fragile, discretionary claims, leading to mispricing, delayed maturation, and even acquihires that reward equity holders while leaving token ecosystems orphaned.

Yet, Edws concludes on an optimistic note: We’re close to solving this, not through new tech, but through harmonization—verifiable trails from network activity to token holders, backed by clear U.S. regulatory frameworks. This would unlock risk capital and innovation by letting markets underwrite tokens with familiar tools.

This aligns precisely with the thesis here. The pioneers we highlighted—Rainbow’s Class F equity stake (20% held by the Foundation for $RNBW holders, ensuring acquisition upside flows to the community), Morpho’s full nonprofit transfer (eliminating external equity extraction), and emerging models like Colosseum’s STAMP (a unified investment contract making the token the sole economic unit, with built-in protections via MetaDAO governance)—are already providing grassroots leadership.

Add Uniswap’s “UNIfication” (activating protocol fees routed to UNI burns, consolidating teams for focused growth, and reducing supply dramatically) and Blockworks’ Token Transparency Framework (a standardized disclosure standard adopted by projects like Morpho, Jito, and Aerodrome for supply schedules, vesting, and financials)—and the pieces are converging.

Infrastructure like Fairmint’s on-chain cap table tokenization waits in the wings, ready to scale once KYC/accreditation barriers ease with regulatory clarity (e.g., Clarity Act progress, safe harbors, SEC/CFTC harmonization).

The buyback frenzy offers short-term alignment but risks starving reinvestment in a growth-starved industry. True fixes—structural unification, transparency, and enforceable rights—let projects compound aggressively, like early tech giants, while ensuring token holders capture the expanded pie.

## Conclusion

As U.S. leadership shapes global standards, “make money” tokens can evolve into legitimate productive assets: verifiable, durable, and aligned. Global capital won’t need a new belief system—they’ll use the ones that already work.

The kids’ table is folding up. Crypto is maturing into real ownership, real growth, and real dominance. The next phase isn’t hype—it’s healthy, sustainable evolution. We’re closer than it feels.
