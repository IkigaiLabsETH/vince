There it is—Arkham showing Wintermute’s wallets sitting at about $457 million as of mid-December 2025. Down from the $540 million peak late November, sure, but still breathing. Substantial. Diversified. SOL heavy at $84 million, ETH $48 million, USDC $44 million, BTC $30 million. Not the corpse the Twitter degens were burying back in October.

Honestly, I tweeted that Wintermute had blown up on October 10. No proof. Just a gut punch from watching the “monster crash” unfold—$19-20 billion liquidated in a blink, Bitcoin knifing down 15% to the low 100s, everything redder than a forced redemption notice. Felt like 2022 all over again, market makers getting ADL’d into oblivion on Binance. 

## Context

We all saw those $700 million deposits hours before the drop. 

Smelled like blood.

But... digging deeper these past weeks, reloading old threads, cross-checking Arkham flows, reading their OTC report—turns out my gut was wrong. Again. Classic me, exiting too early on the fear trade.

## Main

Wintermute? They’re the invisible hand nobody notices until it stops working.

Evgeny Gaevoy started this thing back in 2017, fresh off Optiver’s HFT desks where he made markets in ETFs the old-school way. 

Brought that rigor to crypto—algorithmic neutrality, profiting off spreads and rebates, not directional moonshots. No leverage-fueled hero bets. Just relentless hedging, quoting bids and asks across 60+ exchanges, CeFi and DeFi alike.

Their bread and butter: market making to tighten spreads, reduce slippage for new listings. Then the OTC desk—big-boy trades off-exchange so institutions don’t nuke the tape. By 2024-2025, that exploded. 313% growth in OTC volumes, per their year-end review. 

Outpaced the overall market’s 142% rise. Hit a single-day record of $2.24 billion in November 2024—more than their entire weekly high from 2023.

Kind of wild, huh? While retail was chasing memecoins, TradFi was quietly piling in—spot ETFs approved, corporate treasuries loading up, regulatory fog lifting a bit. Memecoins grabbed 16% of their OTC spot volume, up from 7%. Derivatives up 300%, CFDs eating 4.3% in months. 

They even rolled 24/7 trading for BlackRock’s BUIDL fund.

Daily volumes? Often north of $5 billion total. Systemic. 

The plumber keeping the pipes from bursting. 

But plumbers get blamed when shit hits the fan.

October 10-11, 2025. Geopolitics—Trump’s tariff threats or whatever macro spark—lit the fuse. Record open interest, leveraged to the gills. Flash crash. Binance’s ADL kicks in, depegging synthetics, liquidating at “ridiculous prices,” as Gaevoy later called it.

Wintermute paused trading. Rules broken. On-chain showed massive deposits pre-crash. Twitter lit up: “Wintermute blew up.” “Insolvent.” “Sue Binance.” Threads screaming coordinated dumps, $2 billion alt bleed.

I bought it. Hook, line. We had that tweet out—gut feeling, no proof. Bet you saw the same FUD avalanche.

Then Gaevoy posts: “We’re perfectly fine.” Executives calling bankruptcy talk “baseless FUD.” No lawsuit plans— “complete bullshit,” he said in November when rumors resurfaced. 

No coordination with other makers. 

Just standard liquidity management.

Post-crash flows? Yeah, they dumped hard. $1.5 billion BTC alone over weeks, plus ETH and SOL. Holdings cratered from $540 million to low $320s, rebounding to $457 million by mid-December. 

Analysts called it de-risking in the “digestion phase.” Controlled batches, not panic fire sales. No borrowing spikes, no forced liqs flagged.

No layoffs announced. No funding crises. Instead—New York office opened, U.S. hires, partnerships like Pyth for on-chain HFT, credit lines from Cantor.

Survived the 2022 hack that cost $160 million. Survived this.

Critics still yap—market makers exacerbating volatility, “loan option” games with tokens. Fair points in a gray regulatory swamp. But Wintermute’s transparency (those labeled wallets) and quick denials held up. No credible blow-up evidence. Just growth metrics screaming the opposite.

Maybe I’m wrong again. Could be off-balance-sheet leverage I can’t see. Private firm—no full balance sheets. But on-chain doesn’t lie, and their actions post-crash look like prudence, not desperation.Reminds me of missing the full mania in past cycles—sold too soon, blinded by execution fears. Here, the rumor was the easy short. Facts harder.

Crypto’s maturing, slowly. Institutions need liquidity without slippage. Market makers like Wintermute provide it—neutral, volume-driven, bridging chaos to efficiency.

They didn’t blow up in October. Adapted. De-risked. Kept building.

We’ll see what 2026 brings? National reserves? More crashes?

## Conclusion

Stay hungry. Stay foolish. 

And maybe... stay skeptical of your own gut sometimes.
