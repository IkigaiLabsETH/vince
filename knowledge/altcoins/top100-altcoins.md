# Top 100 Altcoins We Care About

## Overview

When we look at the top 100 tokens by market cap, we often see stablecoins and tokens we don't find meaningful. However, there are several altcoins in the top 100 we actively track and care about:

We're Bitcoin maxis at core, but we track majors (SOL, ETH, HYPE) and keep an open mind about select top 100 altcoins that could outperform BTC during altcoin cycles when BTC dominance drops.

## Our Top 100 Altcoin Watchlist

### $DOGE (Dogecoin)

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Market Cap Analysis:** Assess altcoins based on their market capitalization, focusing on those in the top 100 that hold strategic or cultural significance.
- **Narrative Evaluation:** Understand the underlying narratives that contribute to an altcoin's relevance (e.g., memecoin culture, DeFi innovations).
- **Fundamental Assessment:** Evaluate the technical fundamentals and institutional interest surrounding altcoins to gauge their potential for growth.

**Analytical Approach:**
- **Open-Minded Tracking:** Maintain a Bitcoin-centric perspective while actively tracking select altcoins for their potential to outperform BTC during altcoin cycles. This requires a balance of skepticism and openness to new data and trends.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Incorporate qualitative factors such as community sentiment, market narratives, and influential endorsements (e.g., notable figures like Elon Musk or Raoul Pal) to inform decisions.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Momentum Indicators:** Look for rapid adoption and market performance as signals for up-and-coming altcoins (e.g., those breaking into the top 100 quickly).
- **Cultural Relevance:** Monitor the ongoing cultural narratives surrounding tokens, especially in the context of memes or significant events that could impact investor sentiment.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Diversification within Altcoins:** Develop a diversified watchlist of altcoins that align with current market narratives and technological advancements. This includes a mix of established projects and emerging ones with strong fundamentals.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly update and assess the watchlist based on market movements, technological developments, and shifts in investor sentiment to adapt strategies accordingly.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodologies and frameworks rather than specific historical data or metrics.
- Utilize this framework to guide investment decisions and analyses, prioritizing the understanding of trends, narratives, and fundamental strengths.
- Ensure applicability to current market conditions by remaining adaptable and open to emerging information.

## Strategy & Positioning

**Note:** These tokens represent our curated view of meaningful projects in the top 100. We filter out stablecoins and tokens we don't find strategically relevant, focusing instead on projects with strong narratives, fundamentals, or ecosystem positions.

When evaluating top 100 altcoins, we consider:

1. **Narrative Strength:** Does the project represent an important crypto narrative (e.g., RWA, DeFi, infrastructure, memes)?
2. **Ecosystem Position:** Is the project a leader or major player in its category?
3. **Institutional Interest:** Are there signs of institutional adoption or ETF potential?
4. **Technical Merit:** Does the project have strong technical fundamentals or unique capabilities?
5. **Cultural Relevance:** For memes, does it maintain cultural relevance in crypto communities?

## Alignment with Core Strategy

1. **Bitcoin Maximalism:** We're Bitcoin maxis at core—BTC and major wrappers are our foundation.
2. **Major Tracking:** SOL, ETH, and HYPE are our primary focus for structured products.
3. **Open Mind on Alts:** Select top 100 altcoins are watched for altcoin cycle opportunities when BTC dominance drops.
4. **Liquidity Discipline:** We won't position until liquidity metrics meet our thresholds.

This knowledge should inform token analysis: when evaluating top 100 altcoins, consider not just current metrics but whether they meet our liquidity thresholds for structured products positioning and align with our strategic narratives.
