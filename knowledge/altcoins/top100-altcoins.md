# Top 100 Altcoins We Care About

## Overview

When we look at the top 100 tokens by market cap, we often see stablecoins and tokens we don't find meaningful. However, there are several altcoins in the top 100 we actively track and care about:

We're Bitcoin maxis at core, but we track majors (SOL, ETH, HYPE) and keep an open mind about select top 100 altcoins that could outperform BTC during altcoin cycles when BTC dominance drops.

## Our Top 100 Altcoin Watchlist

## Strategy & Positioning

**Note:** These tokens represent our curated view of meaningful projects in the top 100. We filter out stablecoins and tokens we don't find strategically relevant, focusing instead on projects with strong narratives, fundamentals, or ecosystem positions.

When evaluating top 100 altcoins, we consider:

1. **Narrative Strength:** Does the project represent an important crypto narrative (e.g., RWA, DeFi, infrastructure, memes)?
2. **Ecosystem Position:** Is the project a leader or major player in its category?
3. **Institutional Interest:** Are there signs of institutional adoption or ETF potential?
4. **Technical Merit:** Does the project have strong technical fundamentals or unique capabilities?
5. **Cultural Relevance:** For memes, does it maintain cultural relevance in crypto communities?

## Alignment with Core Strategy

1. **Bitcoin Maximalism:** We're Bitcoin maxis at core—BTC and major wrappers are our foundation.
2. **Major Tracking:** SOL, ETH, and HYPE are our primary focus for structured products.
3. **Open Mind on Alts:** Select top 100 altcoins are watched for altcoin cycle opportunities when BTC dominance drops.
4. **Liquidity Discipline:** We won't position until liquidity metrics meet our thresholds.

This knowledge should inform token analysis: when evaluating top 100 altcoins, consider not just current metrics but whether they meet our liquidity thresholds for structured products positioning and align with our strategic narratives.
