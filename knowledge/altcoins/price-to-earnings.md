It started with a single Substack from Santi (Inverse Finance):

“ We finally got every headline we prayed for (ETFs, Stripe stablecoins, friendly regs) and prices still went down → the “adoption = moon” trade is dead. Everything except Bitcoin is priced to absolute perfection on $1–3B of hyper-cyclical casino fees → 200–400× P/S for Ethereum, still 20–60× for Solana. That’s not “early,” that’s priced like God with zero margin of safety. Staking rewards aren’t earnings, they’re dilution. Real revenue = fees/MEV, and 95%+ of it comes from perps, memecoins, and liquidations → Vegas, not SaaS. Crypto has no real network effects yet: more users = worse UX, mercenary liquidity, forkable code, zero stickiness. We’re priced at 5–50× Meta’s market cap per user while delivering the opposite of Facebook’s flywheel. Value is leaking from L1s → L2s → apps → user aggregators. The fat-protocol thesis is inverted.”

Dragonfly’s Haseeb clapped back within minutes.

Threadguy threw them in a ring.

The greatest crypto fight of 2025 was on.

Round 1 – The Optimist (Haseeb)

Haseeb’s thesis is simple and seductive: Ethereum is the internet’s new operating system. Gas fees aren’t a bug; they’re the toll on the only highway that matters. Network effects are so vicious that L2s and rival L1s are just on-ramps to the same city. Stablecoins are the Trojan horse smuggling real-world GDP onto the chain, and we’re still in the dial-up phase. His favorite slide: Amazon traded at 300–600× sales for most of 1997–2000. The market was right, just early. ETH at 380× fee revenue today is not a bubble; it’s a call option on exponential adoption. “We’re fricking early” isn’t copium when the protocol is open-source Linux + Cisco rolled into one: no one got rich owning the TCP/IP stack, but the companies that built on it printed trillion-dollar empires.

Round 2 – The Realist (Santi)

Santi didn’t flinch. “Amazon never traded above 28× sales even at the absolute peak of the dot-com bubble. ETH is at 380× today. That’s not ‘early’; that’s priced like God.” His counter-punch combo: No durable moat, Solana, Base, and a dozen other chains are eating Ethereum’s lunch on speed and cost. 95 % of activity is still zero-sum speculation or yield farming musical chairs. Real on-chain GDP? Still basically zero. Then he dropped the mic and revealed what he’s actually building. While everyone else is racing to make the 2,847th marginal improvement in finality or ZK throughput, Santi looked at the onboarding funnel and saw horror: New user → memecoin casino → 90 % drawdown → rage-quit forever. His fix is brutal and brilliant: stop trying to convince the real world to move on-chain. Just buy the real world and hard-fork it onto the chain. Inverse is becoming a private-equity roll-up that acquires cash-flowing off-chain businesses and converts them into full crypto natives:

Tokenized equity

On-chain revenue and P&L

Payroll in stablecoins

Transparent cap tables

One KPI to rule them all: real GDP on-chain. Not TVL, not token price, not DAUs gambling on dog coins. The tech is solved. Stablecoins are here. The missing piece was never another consensus tweak; it was capital allocation strategy. So Santi is doing the most crypto-native thing possible: using crypto’s absurd valuations to buy the boring, profitable economy and drag it on-chain, kicking and screaming if necessary. Berkshire onchain.

The Surprise Twist

Haseeb didn’t just applaud from the sidelines. Dragonfly led Inverse’s round. The optimist funded the realist. Meanwhile, in the Legacy World…Western Union – yes, that Western Union, is going all-in on stablecoins: Solana issuance, inflation-proof cards, trapped-capital unlock, real-world on/off-ramps. Market prices it at 4× P/E like it’s already dead. If they execute, it’s the greatest legacy-to-crypto glow-up ever attempted. Real GDP on-chain, no points farming required.

Uber burned billions of real cash so people would love the ride. Crypto prints billions in fake equity so people can farm the subsidy and leave. Uber riders wanted to get home. Crypto users just want the next flight to another farm. That’s not bootstrapping adoption; that’s musical chairs with zero-cost tokens. Santi looked at the game, shrugged, and decided to just buy the taxis.

Verdict

No knockout blow. But something better emerged. Both sides agreed on the endgame: crypto wins when real economic output lives on-chain. Stablecoins are the Trojan horse. Apps are non-negotiable. Everything else, L2 vs L1, tokenomics circlejerks, culture-war memes, is noise. Haseeb supplies the rocket fuel. Santi supplies the guidance system. In a coliseum full of casino kings and rug-pull royalty, their fight felt like the first adult conversation crypto has had in years. The coliseum is still roaring. But we know what we’re actually fighting for.

The real win: crypto finally stopped talking about shitcoins and started talking about who actually captures value. ETH is not a company trading at 300× sales, it’s a scarce monetary commodity like gold. Gold miners have revenue; gold itself is priced on inelastic supply + demand. Same for ETH: post-Merge issuance near-zero, burns real, validators are just miners. Tokenized RWAs and stablecoins will drive exponential demand for ETH as collateral and security, not for gas fees. Santi’s P/S framework is a category error. ETH is digital gold with yield, still <10% of gold’s market cap, and the real scarcity game hasn’t even started.

Commodity > revenue. Always was.

TL;DR Upside from $3,000 ETH?

2026–2027: 1.5–2.5× → $4,500–$7,500 (fair-value models + Fusaka + ETF)

2030 base case: 5–7× → $15,000–$21,000

Bull case: 10×+ → $30,000+ if ETH grabs 20–30% of gold’s market cap

3× is the absolute floor.

The scarcity + tokenization flywheel is only just starting.

Still plenty of juice left.

BTC gets you to the moon.
ETH owns the rocket fuel factory.

BTC is pristine digital gold (5×). ETH is digital gold + the only programmable settlement layer for the $100T+ RWA/tokenization wave. BlackRock, Ondo, BUIDL, stables — everything real is already building on Ethereum, not Bitcoin. Same scarcity, plus staking yield, plus actual exploding utility.

Outro: The Misfit’s Confession

I’ve spent fifteen years in this asylum watching golden retrievers guard sandcastles that get washed away every cycle. Beautiful castles. Moats filled with leverage. Flags that read “1000x or bust.” Then the tide rolls in, the memes get rugged, and the same architects show up next bull run with new shovels and the same pitch. I’m done funding sand. Give me the guy who looks at the beach, shrugs, and starts buying the boardwalk instead. Give me the heretic who says “fuck another consensus tweak” and quietly acquires a chain of laundromats in Ohio so he can pay the cleaners in USDC and tokenise the damn dryers. Give me the VC who still says “we’re fricking early” but puts eight figures behind the realist who’s actually moving GDP instead of TVL.

That Inverse round? I wasn’t in it. But if I had dry powder left after the last war, that’s the term sheet I’d be fighting to sign. Not because it’s the sexiest deck on Earth. Because it’s the first one in years that doesn’t need a single sandcastle in the pitch.

The dog in the photo gets it. He’s sitting on what’s left of someone’s masterpiece, looking straight at the ocean like: “Nice art, bro. Tide’s coming.”

Less castles.
More boardwalk.

That’s the trade I want to back for the rest of this decade.

See you on dry land.

Yearn (YFI) – 4× P/S. The auto-compounding yield brain that quietly earns 8-18% blended APYs with zero leverage or memecoin exposure. Recurring vault fees survive every cycle; the cockroach at the cheapest multiple in DeFi.

Aave (AAVE) – 7.5× P/S. DeFi’s JPMorgan: $54B TVL, institution-grade audits, MiCA-ready, default collateral backbone. When tokenized real-world assets need to borrow, they borrow here. Still stupidly cheap for the category king.

Ethena (ENA) – 6.9× P/S. The dollar that pays you 15-18% to hold it, backed by delta-neutral funding instead of banks. USDe is already the highest-yielding “cash” in crypto and still trades under 7× sales. (Most mispriced innovation).

Three protocols, all under 8× P/S, all printing real recurring revenue today. That’s the entire DeFi allocation for anyone who’s done paying 300× for casino fees.

Tron is trading at a 41x price-to-sales ratio, which makes it one of the cheapest L1s. Solana is at 42x, Ethereum is at 380x, BNB is at 400x.
