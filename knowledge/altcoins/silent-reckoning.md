I’m staring at this old chart on my screen—the one I scribbled notes on back in early ‘23 when Solana was down bad after FTX, trading at what, $21 a token? I full-ported, cashed out a bit too soon, around $210.

But yeah, you asked about Solana wrapping up 2025—verifying those growth stories amid all the noise? I’ve been reloading Dune dashboards, pulling up Messari reports till my eyes blur. No gloss here, friend. Just the raw autopsy: what held up, what crumbled, and why I’ve dialed back the stacking these days.

> Solana hit me as this speed demon, promising sub-second transactions while Ethereum was choking on gas fees like a ‘90s dial-up modem. I bought in at around $21 average cost basis, testing the waters after getting burned on some early altcoins. Felt like value: strong team, Anatoly Yakovenko’s vision echoing those Quiksilver days when we pioneered action sports gear before it blew up. But markets? They don’t care about your gut. Fast forward to late ‘25, and Solana’s no longer the underdog. It’s this battle-tested beast, navigating institutional handshakes, tech tweaks, and a retail hangover that left bodies everywhere. My mid-year notes—yeah, those optimistic scribbles from June or so—pegged circulating supply at 551 million SOL. Wrong. Emissions kept pumping; as of December 18, it’s sitting at about 562 million. Like a slow leak in your tire—you don’t notice till you’re flat.

## Context

Inflation’s another ghost I chased. My notes had it at 6.017%, but reality bit back: down to 4.115%–4.59% annually now, with that 15% yearly cut kicking in. Could double to 30% if SIMD-0411 passes, speeding up disinflation like hitting the brakes on a runaway train. Reminds me of the dotcom era, when companies burned cash faster than they earned it—Solana’s trying to avoid that fate, curbing emissions to build scarcity.

Staking? Still rock solid, 88%–89% of supply locked in, yields around 5%–6.4%. Ethereum’s at a pathetic 23% by comparison. If you’re not staking, you’re bleeding share—simple as that. I staked mine early, but sold it all near the ‘24 top.

Here’s where the narrative cracks. My notes crowed about Solana snagging 50% of crypto app revenue, up from 0.3%—a 166x jump. Directionally right, but overstated. By November ‘25, it’s closer to 31%, down from mid-year highs when memecoins lit the sky. Still, annual revenue clocked ~$2.85 billion from October ‘24 to September ‘25, matching outfits like Palantir or Robinhood.

## Main

Pretty crazy for a blockchain. Pull up DefiLlama: TVL at $8.5 billion, 24-hour revenue $76,509, DEX volumes $3.49 billion. Dominant, sure, but cooled off from the peaks. Artemis data backs it: 98–127 million monthly active users, 34 billion transactions, $1.6 trillion in volume—often more than all other L1s and L2s combined. On X, folks are still buzzing, but skeptics chime in about overreach.

Me? I see echoes of WebTV: promised the world, delivered speed, but adoption’s the real moat. And philosophically... man, Solana vs. Ethereum’s like my active investing wars against index funds.

Ethereum’s all vision—rollup-centric, chasing synchronous composability with SNARKs and shared sequencing by maybe ‘28. “Vision with a business,” they say.

Solana? Business first, vision trailing: immediate performance, centralized block production scaling to distributed nodes. Fees at $0.003 median, throughput chewing through billions. But security worries nag—like that ‘22 outage.

Daily active addresses steady at 3–4 million now, post-dip. Projections hold: 720 million SOL by 2030, 1.45% terminal inflation, maybe faster with SIMD-0411. Fee burns help—122,975 SOL torched in 60 days, 50% gone forever. But without adoption, it’s just numbers. I learned that the hard way with early angel deals—poured into a startup that flamed out because users never showed.

Institutional stuff? That was the game-changer I bet on. My notes pegged 90% odds on ETFs in ‘25. Nailed it. Spot SOL ETFs launched: VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, even Fidelity filed and delivered. Inflows hit near $700 million by December, though Bitwise saw outflows lately—first blood. Staking ETFs too, Bitwise’s at $608.9 million, yields up to 7.03%.

Superstate’s “Opening Bell” went live, trading SEC-registered equities on-chain. Then xStocks: tokenized AAPLx, NVDAx on Bybit, Kraken, Kamino ($2B liquidity), Raydium ($1.6B). Volumes over $10 billion, 58% of tokenized stock trading. Available in 190+ countries—bet you didn’t see that coming.

Partnerships stacked up: Western Union eyeing USDPT for ‘26, Visa settling USDC on Solana. Tokenized assets? $13–35 billion, up 350% YoY, RWAs like FOBXX leading. Network held during $10B+ volume spikes, no big crashes.

Devs at ~4,500, steady inflows.

Now, the memecoin trenches... god, what a bloodbath.

I dipped in once, mid-’25, chasing a quick flip on Pump.fun. Put in $5K, got rugged in 48 hours. Small loss, but the toll? Sleepless nights, second-guessing. Unglamorous as hell. My notes nailed the stats: 98% tokens dead before 90 days, 15% in 24 hours, <1% make DEX. 4.25 million wallets, 99% failures.

Losses: 56.6% under $1K, profits? 0.001% over $1M. Bots rule: 60–80% volume, 93/100 top Pump.fun traders automated, Telegram bots sucking $65B+. Pump.fun owned 66–73% market, weekly revenue peaked $13.48M, then hit 10-month lows in July vs. LetsBONK.

Lifetime? $800M+ by August. Memecoin cap at $11.5B, 30K daily launches. X’s full of laments: rugs, bots, no new money, pure PvP.

Traders down 7x from 4.8M peak to 680K. Mid-caps like BONK, WIF shine in rallies, but retail’s fleeing. Honestly, felt like the ‘01 dotcom bust—village idiots salivating over pets.com, me shorting from afar.

But I missed the mania entry, too cautious. Regret? Maybe. Or wisdom.

Upgrades kept me interested. Firedancer launched mainnet December 12, after three years—1M TPS, 20%+ validators. Game-changer, like upgrading from dial-up to fiber. Alpenglow Q1 ‘26: 100–150ms finality, 100x faster than 12 seconds now. Agave and Firedancer competing, tests over 1M TPS. Pain points linger: congestion, regs, rivals. But fixes roll—compliance pushes, infra boosts.

Ecosystem’s alive: Jupiter, Jito, Raydium thriving in RWAs, DeFi. X threads predict growth.

Solana ain’t dying—it’s shedding skin, ditching retail frenzy for institutional armor. Price at $130–$132, down 30% YTD from $295, but ETFs prop it up.

Captures $31–50 per $100 app revenue, from 0.3% start.

> Institutional era’s here, reshaping the game. Look, if we’re boiling this whole autopsy down to the core bear case—the one that’s kept me from going back all-in again—here it is, no fluff: Solana’s retail engine just... broke.

Peak memecoin mania pulled in 4.8 million active traders early ‘25. By December, that’s collapsed to ~650–700k. Seven times fewer humans (or bots pretending to be humans) actually trading on DEXs.

Pump.fun revenue cratered, daily launches still churn but nobody’s buying, rugs everywhere, new capital evaporated. The trenches aren’t cooling—they’re ded.

Everything else—institutional ETFs sucking in $700M, Firedancer hitting 1M TPS, RWAs ballooning, revenue still crushing most chains—looks solid on paper.

> But that retail exodus is the ghost in the machine. Without fresh blood chasing yields or flipping coins, network activity stabilizes at best, deflates at worst. Fees stay low because volume’s spread thin, inflation bites harder than the models admit, and the whole “most used blockchain” story starts feeling like a ghost town with great infrastructure.

I’ve lived this movie before: killer tech, early wins, then the crowd vanishes and you’re left holding a melting ice cube while the institutions circle politely. Solana might mature into a tradfi pipe and survive just fine—price holding $130s on ETF flows says as much. But the explosive, organic growth narrative?

That’s the part that died in ‘25.

> Bear case in one sentence: The users came for the casino, the casino closed, and we’re betting the suits alone can keep the lights on.

We’ll see if I’m wrong again. Wouldn’t be the first time.

We’ll see what ‘26 brings. Me? No longer stacking, still reading filings at dawn.

## Conclusion

Lessons last, friend—stay hungry, stay foolish, but verify the hype.

Might be wrong... but I’ve survived the classic roundtrip.
