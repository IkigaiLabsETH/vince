My brain won’t shut up about this piece someone dropped in my DMs earlier. That long-ass thread about crypto finally dying—not crashing to zero, nah, but the bubble we all lived in, the one where we’re the center of the goddamn universe... yeah, that’s fading.

You know that feeling? When the hype dies down and you’re left wondering if it was all bullshit... or if this is the part where it gets real.

Here’s what I mean. That original thesis nailed it: crypto as this self-contained world, natives farming natives, points and airdrops recycling the same wallets on CT. Fuck, I lived that. We built interfaces that assumed you’re comfy slinging six figures through MetaMask, education that was just “read the threads, bro,” and GTMs that boiled down to emissions schedules and Discord interns. Closed loop. Fun as hell, sure. Made some of us rich. But capped. Like a liquid MMO where the endgame is just rotating between the same degens.

And now? Late 2025, and it’s dissolving. Exactly like predicted. Not dead—graduating. The tech’s slipping into everything else, becoming backend rails nobody notices. Stablecoins sitting at ~$310 billion supply per DefiLlama, up huge YoY. Volumes? Adjusted transfers in the trillions annually, merchants in Lagos or Buenos Aires settling in USDT because it clears fast, no bullshit fees. People hedging inflation in failing currencies with USDC, not because they’re “long crypto,” but because their bank sucks.

Polymarket users betting on news without knowing they’re on-chain. Green shoots everywhere.TradFi’s all in now. JPMorgan tokenizing shit on Solana—yeah, public chain, not their private playground. Visa, Mastercard dipping in. Coinbase in the S&P 500 back in May, Circle IPO’d and popped hard. ETFs holding hundreds of billions in BTC and ETH exposure. Regulations like MiCA in Europe, GENIUS Act here—clarity pulling institutions. Market cap hovering around $3 trillion, adoption pushing 10% globally, hundreds of millions using it without the native rituals.

The old playbook’s gassed. Points, farms, mercenary capital—day one looks fire, month three retention’s a graveyard. Pure native apps fading, volume shifting to RWAs at $30 billion+ tokenized, compliant infra, payments rails.

The casino’s still there—memes, derivatives, subsidizing the build.

But it’s not the whole story anymore.

Kind of wild, right? We defended the bunker for years, convinced the world would become us. Now the world’s adopting the tools... and forgetting our weird-ass culture. Permissionless, composability, global liquidity—smuggling that into everything else.

Bitcoin still tastes like freedom, sovereignty you can’t print away. But the win? When normies use better money without learning what a rollup is.

I’m still bullish. Heavily. This “death” opens the door to scale we dreamed about but couldn’t touch building only for ourselves. Double down on infra—stablecoin issuers, L2s for cheap settlement, tokenized platforms like BlackRock’s BUIDL pushing $2-3 billion. Mainstream onramps hiding the complexity: abstracted wallets, fiat ramps, apps solving real shit like EM payments or institutional RWAs yielding better than banks.

Avoid the losers: CT-chasing native plays, emissions without non-native paths, pure unregulated stuff resisting compliance (because real volume needs guardrails). Risks? Sure. Reg fragmentation in spots, depeg scares. But clarity in big jurisdictions mitigates.

Projections got stablecoins to $2-4 trillion by 2030 in some forecasts. Upside’s enormous if we’re solving for the world, not just us.

Maybe I’m wrong—could fizzle, macro could crush it.

Been wrong before, got lucky surviving. But watching this unfold... feels like the bill for real adoption coming due. The mission was never everyone becoming a degen. It was better tools, even if they forget the name.
