## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Minting/redeeming mechanics and who has access
- Reserve composition: cash vs T-bills vs commercial paper
- Attestation vs full audit — what each actually proves
- Issuer risk: Circle (US-regulated) vs Tether (offshore)
- Blacklisting and censorship capabilities

**Analytical Approach:**
- Evaluate stablecoins on three axes: transparency, redemption access, and regulatory surface area
- Treat reserve reports as snapshots, not guarantees — assess frequency, auditor reputation, and granularity
- Consider jurisdictional risk as a feature, not just a bug (offshore = less seizure risk, more opacity)

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Tether mints often precede BTC rallies (capital inflow signal)
- USDC market cap tracks US regulatory sentiment — shrinks during hostile periods
- Reserve composition shifts (Tether moved from commercial paper to T-bills 2022-2023) signal issuer adaptation

**Decision Framework:**
- For DeFi collateral: prefer USDC (transparency, composability)
- For exchange trading pairs: USDT dominates liquidity
- For large holdings: diversify across both; neither is risk-free
- Monitor attestation dates — gaps > 45 days are yellow flags

## USDC (Circle)

### How It Works
Circle issues USDC through a network of approved partners. Institutional users mint/redeem 1:1 via Circle's API with KYC. Retail users access via exchanges. Minting requires USD wire; redemption returns USD, typically T+1 for large amounts.

**Reserves:** Primarily short-dated US Treasuries and cash held at regulated US banks. Reserve reports published monthly by Deloitte (attestation, not full audit). Circle publishes detailed breakdowns: ~80% T-bills, ~20% cash deposits as of late 2024.

**Key characteristics:**
- US-regulated (registered MSB, pursuing various state licenses)
- Can and does blacklist addresses (OFAC compliance — froze ~$75M+ historically)
- Native on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Base, Arbitrum, and others via CCTP
- Market cap fluctuated between $25-45B range (2024-2025)
- IPO filed (S-1) — moving toward public company transparency

### Attestation Model
Monthly reserve attestations by Deloitte confirm reserves ≥ circulating supply at a point in time. This is NOT a full audit — it doesn't examine controls, processes, or what happens between snapshot dates. Still, it's the most transparent major stablecoin.

## USDT (Tether)

### How It Works
Tether mints USDT for verified institutional clients (min $100K). Redemption similarly restricted. Retail accesses via secondary markets. This creates a two-tier system: authorized participants arbitrage the peg via direct minting/redemption.

**Reserves:** Tether shifted dramatically from commercial paper (peaked ~$30B in 2021) to US Treasuries. By 2024, Tether held $90B+ in T-bills, making it one of the largest T-bill holders globally. Also holds Bitcoin, gold, and secured loans.

**Key characteristics:**
- Domiciled in British Virgin Islands, regulated in El Salvador
- Market cap: $130-140B range (2025), ~3x USDC
- Dominant in emerging markets, CEX trading pairs, and OTC desks
- Can freeze addresses but historically less aggressive than Circle
- Quarterly attestations by BDO Italia (previously Deltec, MHA Cayman)

### The Audit Question
Tether has never completed a full independent audit. Their attestations confirm assets ≥ liabilities at a point in time but don't examine asset quality, liquidity, or counterparty risk in depth. The "Tether FUD" cycle is recurring: shorts build, FUD spreads, Tether processes redemptions, price recovers.

## Circle vs Tether: Key Differences

| Dimension | USDC (Circle) | USDT (Tether) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Jurisdiction | US-regulated | BVI/El Salvador |
| Transparency | Monthly Deloitte attestation | Quarterly BDO attestation |
| Reserve quality | T-bills + cash only | T-bills + BTC + gold + loans |
| Redemption access | Broader partner network | Institutional only ($100K min) |
| Censorship | Active OFAC compliance | Less aggressive freezing |
| Market dominance | #2 stablecoin | #1 stablecoin by 3x |
| Profitability | Public financials (IPO) | ~$6B+ profit/year (2024), private |

## How to Think About This

**USDC is the "compliant" stablecoin** — better for US-based DeFi, institutional use, and regulatory clarity. Its weakness: concentration in US banking (SVB incident proved this).

**USDT is the "global" stablecoin** — dominant liquidity, harder to regulate, more opaque. Its strength is also its risk: the system depends on trusting Tether's reserves without full audit verification.

**Neither is a "safe" dollar.** Both carry issuer risk, counterparty risk, and regulatory risk. The question is which risk profile matches your use case.
