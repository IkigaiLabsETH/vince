## Context

Stablecoins sit at the intersection of payments, DeFi, and regulation. Frameworks here focus on how to reason about reserve quality, peg stability, and depeg scenarios, not on supplying live reserve or flow numbers.

## Main

**Reserve quality:** Assess backing by type (cash, Treasuries, other) and by liquidity and concentration. Understand redemption mechanics—who can redeem, at what delay, and whether there are gates or fees. Use attestations and reports as inputs to this framework; treat specific numbers in knowledge as illustrative.

**Depeg drivers:** Supply/demand imbalance (mass redemptions, mint freeze), collateral value drop (e.g. Treasury selloff), operational or legal events (freeze, sanction, court order). Combine with narrative and flow data (e.g. Tether flows in defi-metrics or macro) for regime assessment.

**Design spectrum:** Fully reserved fiat-backed vs algorithmic or hybrid; each implies different trust assumptions and failure modes. Regulation (e.g. US stablecoin bills, MiCA) may constrain design; use regulation knowledge for policy framework.

**Related content:** Defi-metrics and macro-economy contain essays that reference stablecoins and flows; use for methodology and narrative, not for current metrics.

## Conclusion

Use stablecoin knowledge for reserve and depeg frameworks. For current peg, reserve, or flow data, use actions and APIs.
