*The art of surviving to trade another day*

## The First Rule

> "Rule #1: Never lose money. Rule #2: Never forget Rule #1." — Buffett

> "It's not how much you make, but how much you don't lose." — Taleb

**The math of losses:**
- 50% loss requires 100% gain to recover
- 90% loss requires 900% gain to recover
- **Preservation > Returns**

---

## Position Sizing

### The Kelly Criterion (Simplified)

```
Position Size = (Edge × Win Rate - Loss Rate) / Edge
```

**Practical version:**
- Risk 1-2% per trade max
- If 50% win rate, 2:1 reward:risk → profitable
- Adjust for confidence

### Risk Sizing Table

| Confidence | Risk % | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Low | 0.5% | Maybe wrong |
| Medium | 1% | Standard |
| High | 2% | Strong setup |
| Extreme | 3% | Only rarely |

---

## The 2% Rule

**Never risk more than 2% on any single trade**

```
Position Size = (Account × 0.02) / (Entry - Stop)
```

**Example:**
- $100,000 account
- Risk 2% = $2,000
- Entry $100, Stop $95 = $5 risk/share
- Position = $2,000 / $5 = 400 shares

---

## The 6% Rule

**Total portfolio risk max = 6%**

- If you're in 3 positions at 2% each = at max
- Don't add new positions
- Close or reduce before adding

---

## Stop Losses

### Types of Stops

| Stop Type | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Price** | Exit at $X | Defining risk |
| **Percent** | Exit at -X% | Mechanical |
| **Time** | Exit at date | Earnings |
| **Trailing** | Move with price | Protecting profits |

### Where to Place Stops

> "Place stops where the trade 'doesn't work'"

- Below support (long)
- Above resistance (short)
- Below moving average
- At invalidation level

**Never:**
- Place stops at obvious levels (market hunts them)
- Move stops further away (doubling down)

## Correlation & Diversification

### Correlation Matrix

| | Stocks | Bonds | Gold | Crypto |
|---|--------|-------|------|--------|
| Stocks | 1.0 | -0.2 | 0.1 | 0.3 |
| Bonds | -0.2 | 1.0 | 0.3 | 0.0 |
| Gold | 0.1 | 0.3 | 1.0 | 0.2 |
| Crypto | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 |

**Diversify across:**
- Asset classes
- Sectors
- Strategies
- Geographies

---

## The Correlation Trap

### Don't Over-Diversify

> "Diversification is a hedge against ignorance." — Buffett

- 10+ positions = diluted returns
- 3-7 quality positions > 20 random ones
- **Concentrate on your best ideas**
- **Diversify across time**

---

## Drawdown Management

### The Drawdown Spiral

| Drawdown | Recovery Needed |
|----------|-----------------|
| -10% | +11% |
| -20% | +25% |
| -30% | +43% |
| -50% | +100% |
| -90% | +900% |

### Max Drawdown Rules

- **Stop trading at -20%** — Reevaluate
- **Reset at -30%** — Take a break
- **Never revenge trade** — You'll lose more

---

## The Exit Strategy

### When to Take Profits

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Target hit | Take 50%, let rest run |
| Overextended | Scale out |
| Weakness | Exit |
| Time expiry | Take what you have |

### When to Take Losses

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Stop hit | Exit immediately |
| Thesis broken | Exit immediately |
| Better opportunity | Rotate |

---

## Risk/Reward Ratio

### The Minimum

**Always demand minimum 2:1**

```
Risk: $500 → Reward: $1,000
```

**Why?**
- 50% win rate → break even
- 40% win rate → profitable
- **Positive expectancy = Edge × Win Rate - Loss Rate**

---

## The Holy Trinity

### 1. Position Sizing

> "Size determines destiny."

- Never too big
- Sleep well with position
- Scale up slowly

### 2. Stop Losses

> "Let winners run, cut losers short."

- Define risk before entry
- No exceptions
- Move stops only in profit direction

### 3. Diversification

> "Don't put all eggs in one basket."

- But don't over-diversify
- Correlation matters
- Quality > quantity
