# MiCA: EU Crypto Regulatory Framework

## What MiCA Covers

**Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs)** — exchanges, custodians, brokers, advisors, and portfolio managers must obtain authorization from their home EU member state's national competent authority. This includes capital requirements, governance standards, complaint handling, and conflict-of-interest policies. Passporting allows a CASP licensed in one member state to operate across all 27.

**Stablecoin rules** are MiCA's most impactful provisions. E-money tokens (pegged to single fiat, like USDC) require e-money institution or credit institution authorization. Asset-referenced tokens (pegged to baskets) face stricter rules including reserve composition mandates, redemption rights, and limits on daily transaction volume for "significant" tokens. Reserves must be held in EU-based custodians with strict segregation.

**The Tether situation** is the defining case. USDT was delisted from major EU exchanges (Coinbase Europe, Kraken EU, Bitstamp) because Tether did not obtain MiCA e-money token authorization. This shifted significant EU stablecoin volume toward USDC, which Circle proactively licensed under MiCA via its French e-money institution registration. Tether has explored compliance paths but as of early 2026, USDT remains unavailable on compliant EU platforms.

**Impact on US projects**: Any crypto project wanting EU market access must either obtain CASP authorization directly, partner with a licensed CASP, or accept EU exclusion. This creates a bifurcation — well-funded projects invest in compliance, smaller projects retreat to US/Asia markets. The whitepaper requirement (mandatory disclosure document for token offerings) adds a compliance layer that resembles traditional securities prospectuses.

**Exchange licensing competitive dynamics**: Early movers like Coinbase (via Irish entity), Crypto.com, and Bitstamp secured CASP licenses and gained market share from non-compliant competitors. The licensing process takes 3-6 months and requires substantial legal/compliance infrastructure, creating meaningful barriers to entry.

**DeFi's gray area**: MiCA explicitly acknowledges that "fully decentralized" protocols fall outside its scope — but the definition of "fully decentralized" remains contested. Projects with identifiable governance teams, foundation treasuries, or upgrade mechanisms may be deemed CASPs. This uncertainty is pushing some DeFi protocols to restructure governance before EU authorities clarify enforcement.

**Global template effect**: MiCA's framework is being studied and partially replicated by regulators in the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Brazil. US lawmakers have referenced MiCA as both a model and a competitive threat — the argument that the EU is ahead on regulatory clarity has been a catalyst for US legislative urgency.
