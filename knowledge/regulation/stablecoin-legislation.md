# Stablecoin Legislation

## Legislative Status

**The GENIUS Act** (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) passed in 2025 and represents current law. It established a federal framework for stablecoin issuance, reserve requirements (1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets), and permitted certain forms of stablecoin rewards. Non-bank issuers can operate under federal or state charters.

**The yield war** is the defining conflict of early 2026. Wall Street banks circulated "Yield and Interest Prohibition Principles" demanding a total ban on stablecoin yield, arguing it threatens the deposit base of the US banking system. The crypto industry, led by the Digital Chamber, counters that:
- Static "savings account" yield can be restricted (their concession)
- DeFi liquidity provision rewards must be preserved
- Ecosystem participation rewards (transaction-based) must be preserved
- A two-year study on stablecoin deposit impact is acceptable — without automatic rulemaking

**The impasse**: A White House meeting (week of Feb 10, 2026) between bankers and crypto executives failed to produce compromise. Banks refused to negotiate. The Digital Chamber's position paper (Feb 13) attempts to reset talks. Trump crypto adviser Patrick Witt indicated another meeting may be scheduled for the following week.

**Reserve requirements** under the GENIUS Act mandate 1:1 backing with US Treasuries, cash, or cash equivalents. The debate has largely settled here — the fight is about what stablecoin issuers can *do*, not what backs them.

**Section 404** of the Senate's Digital Asset Market Clarity Act draft outlines permissible reward scenarios. The specific provisions around liquidity provision and ecosystem participation are what the crypto industry is defending as essential for DeFi functionality.

**Timeline**: White House has called for compromise by end of February 2026. Senate Banking Committee hearing on the Clarity Act was cancelled in January due to the yield dispute. The bill needs to clear Banking Committee markup, then get 60 Senate votes. The longer it stalls, the more likely it gets punted past midterms.

**Key players**: Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC, Banking Chair), Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA, key Democratic negotiator), Digital Chamber CEO Cody Carbone, and Trump crypto adviser Patrick Witt as White House mediator.
