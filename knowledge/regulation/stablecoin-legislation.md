# Stablecoin Legislation

## Methodology & Framework

### Core Concepts
Stablecoin regulation sits at the intersection of monetary policy, banking law, and crypto innovation. The key variables: reserve composition requirements, issuer licensing (bank vs. non-bank), yield/interest prohibition scope, and federal vs. state authority. The GENIUS Act (2025) established the baseline; the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act seeks to refine it — but the yield question has become the central battleground.

### Analytical Approach
Follow the money: banks want to protect deposits from stablecoin competition (yield ban = protect banking moat). Crypto firms want stablecoins to function as programmable money with DeFi rewards. The compromise space is narrow — watch for specific carve-outs (liquidity provision, ecosystem participation) vs. blanket prohibitions.

### Pattern Recognition
- Banks consistently lobby for total yield bans — framing stablecoins as shadow banking
- Crypto industry accepts restrictions on static "savings account" yields but fights for DeFi-related rewards
- White House mediation indicates executive branch treats this as must-pass legislation
- Timeline pressure (midterms) creates urgency but also rushed compromises
- The GENIUS Act as existing law gives crypto firms leverage: status quo allows yields

### Decision Framework
**For token/protocol assessment**: Does this stablecoin's yield model survive a blanket prohibition? A narrow carve-out? The answer determines protocol viability under different legislative outcomes. **For market positioning**: Stablecoin legislation passage is bullish for compliant issuers (Circle), potentially restrictive for DeFi yield protocols, and neutral-to-positive for overall market structure confidence.

## Legislative Status

**The GENIUS Act** (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) passed in 2025 and represents current law. It established a federal framework for stablecoin issuance, reserve requirements (1:1 backing with high-quality liquid assets), and permitted certain forms of stablecoin rewards. Non-bank issuers can operate under federal or state charters.

**The yield war** is the defining conflict of early 2026. Wall Street banks circulated "Yield and Interest Prohibition Principles" demanding a total ban on stablecoin yield, arguing it threatens the deposit base of the US banking system. The crypto industry, led by the Digital Chamber, counters that:
- Static "savings account" yield can be restricted (their concession)
- DeFi liquidity provision rewards must be preserved
- Ecosystem participation rewards (transaction-based) must be preserved
- A two-year study on stablecoin deposit impact is acceptable — without automatic rulemaking

**The impasse**: A White House meeting (week of Feb 10, 2026) between bankers and crypto executives failed to produce compromise. Banks refused to negotiate. The Digital Chamber's position paper (Feb 13) attempts to reset talks. Trump crypto adviser Patrick Witt indicated another meeting may be scheduled for the following week.

**Reserve requirements** under the GENIUS Act mandate 1:1 backing with US Treasuries, cash, or cash equivalents. The debate has largely settled here — the fight is about what stablecoin issuers can *do*, not what backs them.

**Section 404** of the Senate's Digital Asset Market Clarity Act draft outlines permissible reward scenarios. The specific provisions around liquidity provision and ecosystem participation are what the crypto industry is defending as essential for DeFi functionality.

**Timeline**: White House has called for compromise by end of February 2026. Senate Banking Committee hearing on the Clarity Act was cancelled in January due to the yield dispute. The bill needs to clear Banking Committee markup, then get 60 Senate votes. The longer it stalls, the more likely it gets punted past midterms.

**Key players**: Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC, Banking Chair), Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA, key Democratic negotiator), Digital Chamber CEO Cody Carbone, and Trump crypto adviser Patrick Witt as White House mediator.
