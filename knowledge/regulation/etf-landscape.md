# Crypto ETF Landscape

## Bitcoin Spot ETFs

**Launched January 2024**, the US BTC spot ETFs became the most successful ETF launch in history. By late 2025, combined AUM reached $115-165B range, holding approximately 7% of total BTC supply. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominates with the largest AUM and tightest spreads.

**Flow dynamics in late 2025 / early 2026** have shown maturation: weekly flows swing between significant inflows and outflows ($782M outflow weeks observed in late 2025). This volatility reflects institutional portfolio rebalancing rather than retail panic — a sign of normalization. The target of $180-220B AUM by end of 2026 reflects consensus estimates for continued institutional adoption.

**Leverage concerns**: BlackRock's head of digital assets (Feb 2026) warned that leverage-driven volatility risks undermining Bitcoin's institutional narrative. This is a key meta-risk — if BTC ETF-driven price action becomes dominated by leveraged futures/options overlays, it weakens the "digital gold" thesis that justifies institutional allocation.

## Ethereum Spot ETFs

ETH spot ETFs launched in mid-2024, with more modest flows than BTC counterparts. The staking yield question has been central — early ETH ETFs could not include staking, making them less competitive vs. direct ETH holding. Morgan Stanley's January 2026 filing for ETH ETFs with staking rewards signals the next evolution: staking-enabled ETH ETFs could meaningfully increase demand.

## Altcoin ETF Pipeline

**Solana** is the frontrunner for the next spot ETF. Multiple filings exist, and Morgan Stanley's January 2026 filing for spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETFs together signals institutional conviction. The pro-crypto SEC under Atkins makes SOL ETF approval in 2026 plausible, though the SEC has not formally classified SOL's regulatory status.

**XRP** has seen significant capital rotation, outperforming BTC and ETH in recent price action (Feb 2026) as investors position for potential ETF approval. The Ripple legal resolution removed a major overhang.

**Other applications**: LTC, DOGE, and multi-asset crypto ETFs have been filed. Approval probability correlates with: sufficient decentralization, CME futures existence (provides regulated price discovery), custody solution availability, and absence of ongoing SEC enforcement.

**Capital rotation effect**: As new altcoin ETFs get approved, capital rotates from BTC/ETH ETFs into newer offerings — this is a structural pattern to monitor. It doesn't necessarily mean net new money; it can redistribute existing allocations.
