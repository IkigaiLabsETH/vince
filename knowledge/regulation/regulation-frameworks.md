## Context

Regulation of crypto and digital assets varies by jurisdiction and changes over time. Frameworks here focus on how to reason about regulatory developments and their market impact, not on providing legal or compliance guidance.

## Main

**Jurisdictional mapping:** Identify which authority (SEC, CFTC, state, EU MiCA, etc.) applies to a given product or service. Classification (security vs commodity vs payment) drives disclosure, custody, and trading rules. When legislation is delayed, status quo and court rulings define the effective regime.

**Narrative and sentiment:** Regulatory headlines drive narrative cycles—clarity "coming soon" can support risk-on positioning; delays or hostile drafts can trigger de-risking. Combine regulatory timeline assessment with leverage and positioning data (e.g. perps funding, open interest) to anticipate volatility.

**Scenario planning:** Use base / bear / bull cases for key bills or rulings. Map each outcome to implications for specific assets (e.g. commodity vs security treatment) and for ecosystem segments (DeFi, stablecoins, exchanges). Revisit as amendments and stakeholder positions change.

**Related content:** For specific bills, court cases, or regional developments, see macro-economy (e.g. clarity-act, europe) and substack-essays where essays discuss regulatory events; always treat dates and numbers as illustrative.

## Conclusion

Use regulation knowledge for frameworks and scenario thinking. For current bill status, legal interpretation, or compliance, use authoritative sources and qualified advisors.
