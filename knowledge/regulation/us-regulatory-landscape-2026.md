# US Regulatory Landscape 2026

## The Current Landscape

**SEC under Paul Atkins** has pivoted dramatically from the Gensler era. Atkins' "Project Crypto" agenda aims to provide innovation-friendly rules, but he has openly acknowledged to the Senate Banking Committee (Feb 2026) that without Congressional statute, his rules aren't "future-proof" — they can be reversed by a single commission vote. This is the core tension: rapid executive action vs. legislative durability.

**The Howey Test remains the battlefield.** Every token classification ultimately flows through the 1946 Supreme Court framework: investment of money, in a common enterprise, with expectation of profits from others' efforts. The SEC has historically applied this broadly to most tokens. The shift under Atkins is toward accepting that many tokens — particularly those with sufficient decentralization or utility — may not satisfy all Howey prongs. But without legislation codifying this, it's interpretation, not law.

**CFTC's expanding role** is a key development. The addition of major crypto CEOs to CFTC advisory groups (Feb 2026) signals the agency's growing claim over spot crypto commodity markets. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, if passed, would formally divide jurisdiction: sufficiently decentralized tokens to the CFTC, securities-like tokens to the SEC.

**Congressional dynamics post-2024 election** are the most consequential variable. The pro-crypto Congress has delivered the GENIUS Act (stablecoins) and advanced market structure through the House and Senate Agriculture Committee. But the Senate Banking Committee remains the bottleneck — the Clarity Act needs 60 votes, meaning 7+ Democrats must cross over. Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) has signaled willingness but demands DeFi anti-illicit-finance provisions and conflict-of-interest guardrails.

**Fairshake PAC** continues to reshape Congressional crypto politics, targeting anti-crypto incumbents and funding pro-crypto challengers in both parties. The 2024 cycle demonstrated that crypto PAC spending translates to electoral outcomes.

**Key risk**: The stablecoin yield dispute between Wall Street banks and crypto firms (see stablecoin-legislation.md) has stalled the broader market structure bill. If negotiations collapse, the legislative window may close before midterms shift Congressional composition.

**What to watch**: White House-brokered compromise deadline (end of Feb 2026), Senate Banking Committee markup scheduling, and whether SEC Project Crypto rules can provide interim clarity while legislation develops.
