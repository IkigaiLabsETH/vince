# Global Crypto Regulatory Map

## Methodology & Framework

This document classifies major jurisdictions on a spectrum from **hostile** to **friendly** based on four dimensions: (1) regulatory clarity, (2) licensing accessibility, (3) tax treatment, and (4) enforcement posture. Ratings reflect the practical environment for crypto businesses and users, not just stated policy. A jurisdiction can have clear rules and still be hostile (e.g., restrictive clear rules).

**Rating scale:** 🟢 Friendly | 🟡 Neutral/Mixed | 🔴 Hostile/Restrictive

---

## 🇺🇸 United States — 🔴 Hostile (Improving)

The US remains regulation-by-enforcement under multiple competing agencies. The SEC claims most tokens are securities (Howey test), the CFTC claims jurisdiction over crypto commodities (BTC, ETH), and FinCEN handles AML/KYC. The lack of comprehensive federal legislation creates uncertainty.

**2024-26 shifts:** The FIT21 Act (Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century) passed the House in 2024 but stalled in the Senate. The change in SEC leadership following the 2024 election signaled a potential shift toward clearer rulemaking over enforcement-first approach. State-level activity is patchwork — Wyoming and Texas are friendly; New York's BitLicense remains restrictive.

**Tax:** Property treatment, full capital gains. Wash sale loophole still open. 1099-DA reporting phasing in.

**Bottom line:** Massive market, hostile regulators, but political winds shifting. Companies operate here despite the friction because the market is too large to ignore.

## 🇪🇺 European Union — 🟢 Friendly (Structured)

MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is the world's most comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Fully effective since December 2024, it provides clear licensing categories (CASPs, ARTs, EMTs), passporting across 27 member states, and defined stablecoin requirements.

**Strengths:** Legal certainty, single market access, technology-neutral approach. **Weaknesses:** Compliance costs favor larger players, DeFi treatment remains ambiguous, and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (travel rule implementation) is aggressive — requiring originator/beneficiary data for all crypto transfers, no minimum threshold.

**Tax:** Varies by member state. Portugal was previously a haven (0% crypto tax) but introduced capital gains tax in 2023. Germany's 1-year holding exemption remains attractive.

## 🇬🇧 United Kingdom — 🟡 Mixed

The FCA regulates crypto under the anti-money laundering framework, requiring registration for UK crypto businesses. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 brought crypto within the regulatory perimeter. Stablecoins are being regulated first, with broader crypto rules expected by 2026.

**Stance:** Wants to be a crypto hub (stated government policy) but regulatory execution is slow and the FCA's registration process has a high rejection rate (~80% of applications). Tax treatment is standard capital gains with a £3,000 annual exemption (reduced from £6,000).

## 🇸🇬 Singapore — 🟢 Friendly (Selective)

MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) runs a clear licensing regime under the Payment Services Act. Singapore encourages institutional crypto and blockchain innovation while restricting retail speculation (advertising restrictions, no retail leverage trading).

**Reality:** The licensing process is rigorous — many applications pending for 2+ years. Post-FTX, MAS tightened retail protections. Singapore is friendly to *serious* players, not to everyone. Tax: no capital gains tax, but trading as a business triggers income tax.

## 🇦🇪 UAE — 🟢 Friendly (Aggressive Recruitment)

Dubai's VARA (Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority) and Abu Dhabi's FSRA created competing crypto-friendly zones. The UAE actively recruits crypto companies with clear licensing, no personal income tax, and fast approvals.

**Caveats:** Regulations are new and untested in stress scenarios. VARA licensing categories are comprehensive but compliance infrastructure is still maturing. The UAE's friendly stance is strategic — building a financial hub — and could tighten once market share is established.

## 🇭🇰 Hong Kong — 🟡 Neutral (Re-opening)

After years of restrictive posture, Hong Kong pivoted in 2023-24 to allow licensed retail crypto trading (SFC licensing regime). The goal is competing with Singapore as Asia's crypto hub.

**Status:** Licensed exchanges operating (HashKey, OSL), Bitcoin and Ether ETFs approved (2024). However, mainland China's ban creates political risk — Hong Kong's openness exists at Beijing's discretion. Institutional focus remains stronger than retail.

## 🇯🇵 Japan — 🟡 Mixed (Strict but Clear)

Japan was an early mover post-Mt. Gox, creating a licensing framework under the FSA (Payment Services Act, FIEA). Rules are clear but strict: exchange licensing, cold storage requirements, customer asset segregation.

**Tax:** Crypto profits taxed as "miscellaneous income" at up to 55% — one of the highest rates globally. This is the single biggest friction point and drives capital to friendlier jurisdictions. Reform proposals to reduce to 20% flat rate have been discussed since 2023 but not enacted.

## 🇨🇭 Switzerland — 🟢 Friendly (Pioneer)

"Crypto Valley" (Zug) has been crypto-friendly since 2014. FINMA provides clear guidance, the DLT Act (2021) created legal foundations for tokenized securities, and the regulatory approach is principles-based rather than prescriptive.

**Tax:** No capital gains tax for individual investors (classified as private wealth management). Wealth tax applies to holdings at year-end market value. This combination makes Switzerland one of the most tax-efficient jurisdictions for long-term holders.

**Bottom line:** Expensive to live in, but arguably the best regulatory environment globally for crypto businesses seeking legitimacy and stability.
