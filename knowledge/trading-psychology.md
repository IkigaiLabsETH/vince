## The 7 Deadly Emotions

### 1. Fear

**What it looks like:**
- Selling into weakness
- Missing bounces
- Exiting too early
- "What if it keeps dropping?"

**The cure:**
- Position sizing (never risk more than you can handle)
- Written plan (reduce decision fatigue)
- Accept that volatility = opportunity

> "The market is a voting machine in the short run, a weighing machine in the long run." — Graham

---

### 2. Greed

**What it looks like:**
- Chasing price up
- Adding to winners too late
- Overtrading
- "This time is different"

**The cure:**
- Take profits (it's okay to leave money on the table)
- Written targets
- Remember: no one ever went broke taking profits

> "Greed is the mother of all losses." — Tamil Proverb

### 3. Hope

**What it looks like:**
- Holding losers "in hopes it comes back"
- Averaging down bad positions
- "It will turn around"

**The cure:**
- Time stops for no stock
- Define your thesis in writing
- If thesis breaks = exit
- "Hope is the enemy of the trader"

---

### 4. Pride/Ego

**What it looks like:**
- Refusing to take losses
- "I can't be wrong"
- Average down to "prove" you're right
- Overconfidence after a win

**The cure:**
- Losses are data, not failure
- The market doesn't care about your ego
- Being wrong = learning opportunity

> "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." — Keynes

---

### 5. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

**What it looks like:**
- Buying at breakout (right when everyone else is)
- Chasing "hot tips"
- "Everyone is making money but me"

**The cure:**
- You don't need to catch every move
- Wait for your setup
- The "missed" opportunity was never yours

---

### 6. Regret

**What it looks like:**
- Buying back after selling (revenge trading)
- "I should've held"
- Chasing to make back losses

**The cure:**
- No trade is perfect
- Accept what happened
- Move to next opportunity
- **The regret of missing out hurts less than the regret of a big loss**

---

### 7. Boredom

**What it looks like:**
- Trading for action, not edge
- "I need to do something"
- Forcing trades in no-setups

**The cure:**
- Not trading = also a decision
- Cash is a position
- Wait for your A+ setups

## The Smart Money vs. The Dumb Money

### Dumb Money
- Follows news
- Chases price
- Buys at highs, sells at lows
- Overtrades
- Reacts to emotion

### Smart Money
- Follows price action
- Buys support, sells resistance
- Buys fear, sells greed
- Waits for setup
- Plans trade, trades plan

## The Trading Loop

```
Signal → Emotion → Action → Result → Reflection → System
     ↑                                    |
     +------------------------------------+
```

**Most traders:**
- See signal (System 2)
- Emotion takes over (System 1)
- Act emotionally
- Blame the system

**Successful traders:**
- See signal → Act mechanically
- Emotion → Acknowledge, don't obey
- Result → Record, analyze
- System → Continuous improvement

## The 90/10 Rule

> "90% of traders lose 90% of their money in 90 days."

**Why?**
- 10% is emotion
- 10% is lack of system
- 10% is overtrading
- 10% is position sizing
- (But mostly emotion)

---

## Mental Frameworks

### 1. The Worst Case

Before every trade ask:
- "What's the worst that can happen?"
- "Can I handle it?"
- "What's my exit if I'm wrong?"

### 2. The asymmetry Check

Ask:
- "What's my risk vs reward?"
- "Is this bet in my favor?"
- "Am I getting paid to take this risk?"

### 3. The Isolation Test

Ask:
- "If this was my only position, would I still take it?"
- "Am I sizing up because I'm down?"
- "Am I adding to a winner or a loser?"
