# Daily Market Brief — 15 February 2026

## 📊 Price Snapshot

| Asset   |   Price | 7d Open |  7d Δ |
| ------- | ------: | ------: | ----: |
| **BTC** | $68,838 | $70,161 | −1.9% |
| **ETH** |  $2,007 |  $2,066 | −2.9% |
| **SOL** |  $87.52 |  $87.05 | +0.5% |

## 📈 7-Day Price Action

### BTC (WBTC)

Opened the week at ~$70.2K, dipped to a weekly low near $66.5K mid-week (Feb 12), then recovered to $68.8K. Range-bound with a slight bearish lean — sellers defending $70K, buyers stepping in around $66K.

### ETH (WETH)

Fell from $2,066 → $1,938 by Feb 11, touching intraday wicks below $1,650. Recovered to ~$2,085 on Feb 14 before settling at $2,007. High volatility (daily ranges of 30-50%) suggests leveraged activity and thin order books at extremes.

### SOL

Weakened from $87 to $78.3 by Feb 12, then staged a notable reversal — climbing back above $88 by Feb 14-15. SOL is the only major to end the week green, supported by strong DEX volume on Solana.

## 🔗 On-Chain Pulse (Feb 14, latest full day)

| Chain        | Active Addresses | Transactions | DEX Volume |  Fees |
| ------------ | ---------------: | -----------: | ---------: | ----: |
| **Solana**   |            2.22M |       266.0M |    $10.45B | $560K |
| **BSC**      |            2.70M |        14.5M |     $4.20B | $251K |
| **Ethereum** |             660K |        1.93M |     $1.32B | $210K |
| **Base**     |             403K |        10.3M |      $622M | $108K |
| **Arbitrum** |             151K |        3.80M |      $216M |  $16K |

**Key trends vs 7d ago:**

- Solana active addresses down 18% (2.72M → 2.22M) but still dominates DEX activity
- Ethereum addresses down 25% (884K → 660K), DEX volume down 33%
- Arbitrum addresses halved (302K → 151K), signaling cooling L2 speculation
- Base held steady on addresses but DEX volume fell 35%

## 💰 Capital Flows

### Stablecoin Supply (Feb 15)

| Token    | Total Supply | 24h Change |
| -------- | -----------: | ---------: |
| **USDT** |      $185.0B |      ~flat |
| **USDC** |       $70.5B |    +$12.9M |
| **DAI**  |       $4.16B |    −$21.9M |

USDC seeing modest inflows; DAI contracting as MakerDAO ecosystem consolidates. USDT steady — no significant mints or burns.

### Top Bridge Routes (7-day)

| Route                  |  Volume | Users |
| ---------------------- | ------: | ----: |
| ETH → Plasma           | $645.8M |   301 |
| Arbitrum ↔ Ethereum    |  $1.18B | 10.2K |
| Arbitrum ↔ Hyperliquid |   $973M | 47.9K |
| ETH → Solana           | $271.8M |  4.6K |
| Hyperliquid ↔ HyperEVM | $472.9M |  8.5K |
| Base → Ethereum        | $141.7M |  8.7K |

**Notable:** Hyperliquid ecosystem bridges ($1.45B combined) rival the Arbitrum↔Ethereum corridor. Nearly 48K users bridged to/from Hyperliquid — a sign of growing perp-DEX adoption. The ETH→Plasma route ($646M from just 301 users) suggests whale-scale institutional flows.

## 🏦 DeFi Health

### DEX Volume (Feb 14)

| Protocol      | Chain    | Volume | Users |
| ------------- | -------- | -----: | ----: |
| PancakeSwap   | BSC      | $3.49B |  416K |
| Meteora       | Solana   | $2.21B |  296K |
| Uniswap       | BSC      |  $701M |   51K |
| Uniswap       | Ethereum |  $690M |   49K |
| Uniswap       | Base     |  $277M |  183K |
| Fluid Lending | Ethereum |  $229M |  1.4K |
| Aerodrome     | Base     |  $225M |   44K |
| Raydium       | Solana   |  $185M |  160K |
| Orca          | Solana   |  $180M |   40K |
| Curve         | Ethereum |  $174M |  3.8K |
| PumpFun       | Solana   |   $73M |  165K |

PancakeSwap dominates daily volume. Solana DEXs (Meteora + Raydium + Orca + PumpFun) combined for $2.65B — surpassing Ethereum's total. PumpFun maintains impressive user counts (165K) despite modest dollar volume, reflecting memecoin micro-trading.

### Lending (Feb 14)

| Protocol    | Chain    |    TVL | Deposits | Borrows | Liquidations |
| ----------- | -------- | -----: | -------: | ------: | -----------: |
| Aave        | Ethereum | $22.3B |    $777M |   $272M |        $1.7K |
| Kamino      | Solana   | $3.05B |    $194M |    $49M |           $0 |
| Morpho Blue | Ethereum | $2.56B |    $241M |    $47M |           $0 |
| Spark       | Ethereum | $2.46B |      $8M |    $16M |           $0 |
| Morpho Blue | Base     | $1.97B |    $176M |     $7M |           $0 |
| Aave        | Plasma   | $1.59B |     $13M |     $9M |           $0 |
| Compound    | Ethereum | $1.31B |      $7M |     $6M |           $0 |
| Venus       | BSC      | $1.31B |      $2M |   $496M |           $0 |
| Aave        | Arbitrum | $0.79B |     $25M |     $8M |           $0 |

Liquidations nearly zero across the board ($1.7K total on Aave ETH) — markets are calm despite the week's price swings. Aave maintains dominance with $22.3B TVL on Ethereum alone. Venus BSC shows an unusual borrows/TVL ratio ($496M borrows vs $1.31B TVL) worth monitoring.

## 📰 Top Narratives

1. **Truth Social files for crypto ETFs** — Trump-linked platform seeks SEC approval for a BTC/ETH ETF and a Cronos staking fund, deepening political crypto entanglement.
2. **Stablecoin regulation heats up** — Crypto lobby counters Wall Street bankers' push to ban stablecoin yield, calling for some rewards to be permitted in upcoming legislation.
3. **Ethereum Foundation leadership shakeup** — Tomasz Stańczak exits as co-executive director, continuing governance turbulence that's weighed on ETH sentiment since 2025.

## 🔮 Outlook

**Bearish signals:** BTC and ETH both down on the week with declining active addresses across major chains. Ethereum's 25% address drop and 33% DEX volume decline point to waning retail participation. Arbitrum activity halving suggests L2 rotation fatigue.

**Bullish signals:** Near-zero liquidations indicate healthy leverage. SOL bucking the trend with a green week. Stablecoin supply holding steady at $260B+ total (no capital flight). Hyperliquid bridge volumes exploding — DeFi usage migrating rather than declining.

**Thesis:** The market is in a consolidation phase. Capital is rotating (not leaving) — away from Ethereum/L2s toward Solana and Hyperliquid. BTC needs to reclaim $70K to signal renewed strength; a break below $66K would open downside to $62K. Watch the ETF filing news cycle next week for potential catalysts.
