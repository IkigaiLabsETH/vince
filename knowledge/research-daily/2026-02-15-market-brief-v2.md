# Daily Market Brief — Sunday, February 15, 2026

## Price Snapshot

| Asset |   Price | 24h Open |  7d Ago | 7d Change |
| ----- | ------: | -------: | ------: | --------: |
| BTC   | $68,849 |  $68,884 | $70,161 |     -1.9% |
| ETH   |  $2,006 |   $2,006 |  $2,066 |     -2.9% |
| SOL   |  $87.49 |   $87.45 |  $87.05 |     +0.5% |

## 7-Day Price Action

**BTC ($68,849):** Drifted lower from $70.2K to a weekly low near $66.5K (Feb 12) before recovering modestly. Resistance at $70K; support at $66.8K. Range-bound with a slight bearish tilt — failing to reclaim the $70K level after multiple attempts.

**ETH ($2,006):** Volatile week with a spike to $2.5K intraday highs but closing action firmly in the $1,940–$2,085 band. Tested $1,940 support on Feb 11–12 and bounced. The $2,000 psychological level is pivotal; a close below risks $1,940 retest.

**SOL ($87.49):** Outperformer of the week. Bottomed at ~$78 on Feb 12, staged a sharp recovery to $88 by Feb 14–15. Now trading near 7-day highs. Momentum is bullish; $88.8 is immediate resistance (weekly high), $78 is strong support.

## On-Chain Pulse

### DEX Volume (Feb 14)

Total cross-chain DEX volume: **$16.8B** (down from $17.9B on Feb 13)

| Chain    | DEX Volume | % Share |
| -------- | ---------: | ------: |
| Solana   |    $10.45B |     62% |
| BSC      |     $4.20B |     25% |
| Ethereum |     $1.32B |      8% |
| Base     |     $0.62B |      4% |
| Arbitrum |     $0.22B |      1% |

Solana continues to dominate DEX volume, driven by memecoin activity on Meteora and PumpFun. BSC holds strong with PancakeSwap leading.

### Active Addresses (Feb 14)

| Chain    | Active Addresses | vs Feb 13 |
| -------- | ---------------: | --------: |
| BSC      |        2,698,431 |      ↓ 7% |

| Arbitrum |          151,423 |     ↓ 23% |

Address counts declining across all chains — weekend cooldown pattern plus post-volatility fatigue from the Feb 10–12 selloff.

### Transaction Fees (Feb 14)

| Chain    | Daily Fees |
| -------- | ---------: |
| Solana   |   $560,264 |

| Base     |   $108,411 |
| Arbitrum |    $15,753 |

ETH fees dropped significantly from the $677K peak on Feb 11 (high-volatility liquidation day). Solana fees remain elevated but trending down from $719K on Feb 10.

### TVL (Latest Available — Feb 12)

| Chain    |     TVL |
| -------- | ------: |
| Ethereum | $237.9B |
| Arbitrum |   $9.1B |
| Base     |   $6.5B |

_Note: TVL data unavailable for Feb 13–14 (reporting lag). ETH TVL declined ~$9B over the week from $247B, reflecting the ETH price drop._

## Capital Flows

### Stablecoin Transfer Volume (Feb 14)

| Solana   |          $31.7B |
| BSC      |          $11.6B |
| Arbitrum |           $1.9B |

Base's stablecoin transfer volume is remarkably high (likely includes protocol-level internal transfers). Volumes contracted ~15–25% across chains vs the Feb 11 peak.

## Top Narratives

- **EF leadership shuffle:** Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak departed, the latest in a string of leadership changes — raising governance questions as ETH underperforms.
- **Truth Social crypto ETFs:** Trump-linked Truth Social filed with the SEC for BTC/ETH and Cronos staking ETFs, signaling deepening mainstream-political crypto convergence.
- **Stablecoin regulation battle:** Crypto industry groups pushed back against Wall Street's lobbying for a total ban on stablecoin yield, with competing proposals reaching the White House.

## Outlook

Markets are in a weekend consolidation mode after a volatile week that saw BTC fail to hold $70K and ETH touch lows near $1,940. Solana is showing relative strength, benefiting from sustained retail memecoin activity — but declining active addresses suggest the current cycle may be peaking. The macro backdrop remains uncertain with regulatory headlines dominating, particularly around stablecoin legislation that could reshape DeFi yields. Watch BTC's $68.5K support and whether ETH can reclaim $2,050 early next week.
