## 7-Day Price Action

**BTC** drifted from ~$70,300 on Feb 9 down to a weekly low near $65,150 on Feb 12 before recovering to $68,800. The week printed a clear "V" bottom, with support holding around the $65K zone. Resistance sits at $70K–$70,900 (this week's upper range). A Sunday close above $69K would signal strength going into next week.

**ETH** saw heavier selling pressure, dropping from $2,100 to a Feb 12 low around $1,494 — a ~29% drawdown peak-to-trough — before snapping back above $2,000. The recovery is notable but ETH remains below its Feb 9 open. Key levels: $1,940 support, $2,100 resistance. The ratio continues to underperform BTC.

**SOL** followed a similar pattern — sliding from $87 to the $78–$79 zone mid-week, then rebounding sharply to $87+. SOL has shown relative strength, nearly reclaiming its weekly open. Watch $88.80 (weekly high) as the breakout level; $78 as the floor.

## Volume & Momentum

BTC is trading in a tight 1h range ($68,639–$69,099) on a Sunday afternoon — typical low-volatility weekend consolidation. SOL's 1h range is similarly compressed ($86.68–$87.53), suggesting a directional move is coiling. The mid-week flush and recovery across all three majors suggests dip buyers remain active.

## Top Narratives

1. **Truth Social crypto ETFs** — Trump-linked platform filed with the SEC for BTC/ETH and Cronos staking ETFs, deepening the political-crypto nexus.
2. **Stablecoin bill battle** — Wall Street bankers pushed for a total ban on stablecoin yield at the White House; crypto groups fired back demanding yield capabilities. This legislative fight will shape DeFi's future in the US.
3. **Ethereum Foundation shakeup** — Co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak is out, continuing EF's leadership instability. This adds to the bearish narrative around ETH's underperformance.

## Outlook

Weekend consolidation after a volatile week. BTC holding above $68K is constructive. The macro picture is mixed — good news is being sold into (per CoinDesk's "exit ramp" framing), but the mid-week recovery shows there's still demand at lower levels. Watch for Monday's open to set direction. SOL looks strongest of the three on a relative basis.
