# Daily Market Brief — Sunday, February 15, 2026

## Price Snapshot

| Asset | Price | 24h Change | 24h Range |
|-------|-------|------------|-----------|
| BTC (WBTC) | $68,907 | — | $53,755 – $84,932 |
| ETH (WETH) | $2,005 | -3.7% | $1,701 – $2,721 |
| SOL | $87.55 | -0.6% | $78.14 – $91.21 |

## 7-Day Price Action

**BTC** opened the week at ~$70,161, dipped to a 7d low near $50,591 on Feb 11, and recovered to $68,907 — down ~1.8% on the week. Resistance at $70K; support held around $66K on daily closes.

**ETH** saw more pronounced weakness, from $2,066 open to a $2,005 close — down ~3% on the week. Wide intraday ranges (lows touching $1,478–$1,700) suggest heavy liquidation wicks. Key support at $1,940; resistance at $2,100.

**SOL** was the relative outperformer: opened at $87.05, dipped to $78.33 mid-week (Feb 12), then rallied back to $87.55 — essentially flat on the week. Held above $78 support; needs to break $88.85 (7d high) for continuation.

## On-Chain Pulse

### DEX Volume (Feb 14)
| Chain | DEX Volume | Traders |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Solana | $10.45B | 2.2M addrs |
| BSC | $4.20B | 2.7M addrs |
| Ethereum | $1.32B | 660K addrs |
| Base | $622M | 403K addrs |
| Arbitrum | $216M | 151K addrs |

**Total DEX volume across 5 chains: ~$16.8B** (Feb 14). Down from $18.3B on Feb 13, a ~8% decline — consistent with weekend cooldown.

### Active Addresses (Feb 14 vs Feb 13)
- **BSC**: 2.70M → down from 2.89M (-6.7%)
- **Solana**: 2.22M → flat vs 2.23M
- **Ethereum**: 660K → down from 779K (-15%)
- **Base**: 403K → down from 443K (-9%)
- **Arbitrum**: 151K → down from 197K (-23%)

Activity declining across the board, especially on Arbitrum and Ethereum.

### Transaction Fees (Feb 14)
- **Solana**: $560K (highest absolute — from 266M transactions)
- **BSC**: $251K
- **Ethereum**: $210K
- **Base**: $108K
- **Arbitrum**: $16K

Solana processes 137x more transactions than Ethereum at 2.7x the total fees — reflecting massive throughput at low per-tx cost.

### Stablecoin Transfer Volume (Feb 14)
- **Base**: $132.8B (dominant corridor for stablecoin flows)
- **Ethereum**: $58.5B
- **Solana**: $31.7B
- **BSC**: $11.6B
- **Arbitrum**: $1.9B

## Capital Flows

### Stablecoin Supply
*Data unavailable — Allium stablecoin supply table returned empty for the query period.*

### Bridge Flows
*Bridge volume data returned null USD values for all corridors this period. Notable bridge activity by user count: Monad↔BSC (12 users), Ink→Hyperliquid (10 users). Volume data gaps suggest the bridge_flows_overview table is still backfilling.*

## DeFi Health

### Top DEXs by Volume (Feb 14)
| Protocol | Chain | Volume | Users |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| PancakeSwap | BSC | $3.49B | 416K |
| Meteora | Solana | $2.21B | 296K |
| Uniswap | BSC | $701M | 51K |
| Uniswap | Ethereum | $690M | 49K |
| Uniswap | Base | $277M | 183K |
| Fluid Lending | Ethereum | $229M | 1.4K |
| Aerodrome | Base | $225M | 44K |
| Raydium | Solana | $185M | 160K |
| Orca | Solana | $180M | 40K |
| Curve | Ethereum | $174M | 3.8K |
| Uniswap | Arbitrum | $153M | 13K |
| Balancer | Ethereum | $120M | 2.4K |
| PancakeSwap | Base | $103M | 27K |
| PumpFun | Solana | $73M | 165K |

PancakeSwap on BSC dominates with $3.49B — BSC DEX activity has been elevated. Meteora continues leading Solana DEX volume. PumpFun still pulling 165K users at $73M volume — meme/token launch activity persists.

### Lending
*Query failed — lending_overview table may have schema changes or data gaps. Skipped.*

## Top Narratives

*Web search unavailable (Brave API key not configured). Key themes from on-chain data:*

1. **BSC resurgence** — $4.2B DEX volume and 2.7M active addresses signal a BSC renaissance, with PancakeSwap alone doing $3.5B. Likely driven by memecoin/token launch activity migrating from Solana.
2. **Solana remains the throughput king** — 266M daily transactions, $10.5B DEX volume, but activity is cooling slightly from mid-week peaks. Meteora has overtaken Raydium as the primary venue.
3. **ETH showing relative weakness** — largest address drop (-15% day-over-day), falling DEX volume, and price underperformance vs BTC and SOL. The ETH/BTC ratio continues to compress.

## Outlook

Markets are in a weekend consolidation after a volatile week that saw extreme intraday swings (ETH touching $1,478 intraday on Feb 10). On-chain activity is cooling across all chains — typical for Sunday. The key question is whether BTC can reclaim $70K early next week; if it does, ETH and SOL likely follow with relief bounces. BSC's elevated activity deserves monitoring — it may signal a rotation trade rather than organic growth. Stablecoin and bridge flow data gaps limit our capital flow visibility this week.
