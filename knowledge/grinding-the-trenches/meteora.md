# Meteora LP DCA Strategy: Grinding Volatile Memecoins

## The Problem with Trading Memecoins

Hot memecoins are notoriously difficult to trade profitably:

1. **Extreme Volatility**: 50-200% swings in hours are normal
2. **Emotional Trading**: FOMO on pumps, panic on dumps
3. **Timing is Impossible**: You never know the exact top or bottom
4. **Whipsaw Losses**: Getting stopped out, then watching it reverse
5. **Sleep Deprivation**: 24/7 markets mean you miss moves

The result? Most traders buy high and sell low, repeatedly.

## The Solution: LP as Automated DCA

**Instead of trying to time the market, let the market time you.**

When you provide liquidity in a Meteora DLMM pool, the AMM mechanism automatically:

- **Buys the dip**: As price drops, the pool sells your USDC/SOL to buy more of the memecoin
- **Sells the top**: As price pumps, the pool sells your memecoin for USDC/SOL
- **Collects fees**: You earn trading fees on every swap in both directions

This is essentially **automated grid trading** or **infinite DCA** without:
- Setting orders
- Watching charts
- Making emotional decisions
- Missing moves while sleeping

## How DLMM Rebalancing Works

Meteora's Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) uses concentrated liquidity in "bins":

```
Price Movement Example (FARTCOIN-USDC):

$0.10 ──┐
        │  ← Your liquidity is here (bins around current price)
$0.08 ──┤  ← Price drops: Pool BUYS FARTCOIN with your USDC
        │
$0.05 ──┤  ← More buying as price falls further
        │
$0.03 ──┘  ← You now hold more FARTCOIN, less USDC

Then price pumps:

$0.03 ──┐
        │  ← Price rises: Pool SELLS FARTCOIN for USDC
$0.08 ──┤
        │  ← More selling as price rises
$0.15 ──┤
        │  ← You now hold more USDC, less FARTCOIN
$0.20 ──┘  ← Profit taken automatically
```

**Key Insight**: You don't need to predict direction. You profit from volatility itself.

## Why Memecoins Are IDEAL for This Strategy

### High Volatility = High Fee Revenue

| Asset Type | Daily Volatility | Fee Opportunity |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| BTC/ETH    | 2-5%             | Low             |
| Altcoins   | 5-15%            | Medium          |
| Memecoins  | 20-100%+         | **Very High**   |

More price movement = more swaps = more fees for LPs.

### The "Impermanent Loss" Reframe

Traditional view: "IL is bad, avoid volatile pairs"

**Our view**: In memecoins, IL is actually **forced DCA + profit taking**

- When price dumps: IL means you accumulated more tokens (bought the dip)
- When price pumps: IL means you sold tokens (took profit)
- The fees you earn often exceed IL on high-volume pairs

### Memecoins Trade 24/7 with High Volume

- Degens trade at all hours
- High emotional trading = lots of volume
- Volume = fees for LPs

## Our Tracked Pools

We specifically track these pools for the LP DCA strategy:

### 💎 Stable Base Pair
| Pool | Why |
|------|-----|
| **SOL-USDC** | Main liquidity pair, highest volume, Bin Step 10 |

### 🎰 Memecoin LP DCA Pools
| Pool | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **AVICI-USDC** | Hot narrative memecoin |
| **67-SOL** | High volatility, active trading |
| **KLED-SOL** | Community-driven, volatile |
| **FARTCOIN-USDC** | Consistent volume, meme strength |
| **TERRA-SOL** | Volatile with good liquidity |
| **WHITEWHALE-SOL** | Whale activity, big swings |
| **PsyopAnime-SOL** | Niche community, spiky volume |
| **RALPH-SOL** | Trending memecoin |
| **GAS-SOL** | Meta narrative, volatile |

---

## Pool Selection Criteria

We choose pools based on:

### 1. **24h Volume** (Most Important)
- Higher volume = more fees
- Volume > $100K/day is minimum viable
- Volume > $500K/day is ideal

### 2. **TVL Ratio**
- Volume/TVL ratio indicates fee efficiency
- 50%+ daily volume vs TVL = excellent
- 10-50% = good
- <10% = avoid

### 3. **Bin Step Selection**
- Lower bin step (1-10) = tighter spread, more rebalancing
- Higher bin step (20-100) = wider spread, less rebalancing
- For volatile memecoins: **Bin Step 10-25** is often optimal
- Balances fee capture vs gas costs from rebalancing

### 4. **Token Fundamentals (Memecoin Style)**
- Active community/telegram
- Recent narrative momentum
- Developer activity or meme staying power
- Not just a pure pump-and-dump

---

## Risk Management

### Accept These Realities

1. **Some tokens go to zero**: If the memecoin dies, your LP goes to zero too
2. **Asymmetric downside**: In a -90% crash, you'll hold mostly the crashed token
3. **Gas costs**: Frequent rebalancing costs SOL

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Position Sizing**: Never more than you can lose per memecoin pool
2. **Diversification**: Spread across multiple memecoin pools
3. **Monitor Volume**: Exit pools where volume dies (fees won't cover IL)
4. **Time Horizon**: This works over weeks/months, not hours

### When to Exit

- Volume drops below $50K/day consistently
- Token narrative is dead (no community activity)
- You've hit your profit target
- Better opportunity elsewhere

## Expected Returns

### Fee Revenue (varies wildly)

| Daily Volume | Fee Rate | Daily Fees on $1K position |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------|
| $100K        | 0.10%    | ~$0.10                    |
| $500K        | 0.10%    | ~$0.50                    |
| $1M          | 0.10%    | ~$1.00                    |

*Note: Actual fees depend on your share of pool TVL*

### Total Return Scenarios

| Scenario | Token Price | Your Return |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Pump & Dump | +500% then -80% | Fees + partial profit from sells on way up |
| Slow Bleed | -50% over weeks | Accumulated tokens + fees (may offset some loss) |
| Sideways Chop | ±30% swings | Pure fee accumulation, minimal IL |
| Moon | +1000% and holds | Sold most on way up, profit in USDC/SOL |

**The strategy wins in 3 of 4 scenarios.** Only loses significantly if token goes to zero with low volume.

## Execution Checklist

### Before Entering a Pool

- [ ] Check 24h volume (>$100K minimum)
- [ ] Check TVL ratio (prefer high volume/TVL)
- [ ] Verify pool is the highest-volume one for that pair
- [ ] Check fee tier and bin step
- [ ] Size position appropriately (memecoin = high risk)

### While in Position

- [ ] Monitor volume daily
- [ ] Check fee accumulation
- [ ] Watch for narrative shifts
- [ ] Rebalance position if needed (move bins if price moved significantly)

### Exit Triggers

- [ ] Volume dies (<$50K/day for 3+ days)
- [ ] Token community goes silent
- [ ] Better opportunity identified
- [ ] Profit target reached

## Tracked Pool Configuration

Current tracked pools are configured in:
`src/plugins/plugin-meteora/src/services/MeteoraLpService.ts`

To add new pools, update the `TARGET_POOLS` array with:
```typescript
{
  name: 'TOKEN-SOL',
  tokenA: 'TOKEN',
  tokenB: 'SOL',
  category: 'memecoin',
  description: 'Hot memecoin - LP for auto DCA strategy',
}
```

The plugin automatically finds the highest-volume pool for each configured pair.
