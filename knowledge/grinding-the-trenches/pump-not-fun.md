In the spring of 2024 the trenches of Solana pulsed with a manic, almost religious energy. A single website, Pump.fun, had collapsed the entire ritual of launching a shitcoin into a sixty-nine-second dopamine hit. Upload a jpeg, write a name, pay eight dollars of SOL, and you were live on a bonding curve that felt like legalised crack. Tens of thousands of tokens appeared every day. Some became religions, most became corpses before the creator finished his coffee. By the end of that year the platform had vacuumed up more than seven hundred million dollars in fees, a number so obscene that it briefly made the founders the most profitable company per employee in the history of software.

Then, almost overnight, the music stopped.

## Context

Daily revenue that once touched fourteen million dollars fell to under three hundred thousand. Weekly launch volume collapsed by more than half. The leaderboard of “top buyers” started to look like a suicide note. By the summer of 2025 the most common chart on the platform was a flat line followed by a vertical drop into zero. The casino had not merely slowed down; it had been abandoned while the lights were still on.

The statistics that leaked out afterwards were merciless. More than half a million unique wallets had interacted with Pump.fun. Fifty-one percent of them lost less than five hundred dollars, small enough to be dismissed as “degen tuition.” Forty-four percent were roughly breakeven. Fewer than one percent made life-changing money. Two wallets lost more than a hundred thousand dollars each, and one lost over a million. The house had not just won; it had won everything and left the table without even pretending to tip the dealer.

What killed the golden goose was not a single event but a structural contradiction that had been visible from the beginning to anyone willing to look. The cost of producing a memecoin had fallen to zero, while the cost of speculating on one had remained absurdly high. Creating a token became easier than making a TikTok. Marketing it became a trivial exercise for any teenager with Midjourney and a Telegram bot. The supply of new coins exploded into infinity, yet every trade still carried a combined one-to-two percent tax split between the launchpad and the trading terminal. You were paying luxury-goods margins to gamble on assets that cost less to manufacture than a pack of gum.

## Main

This gap between production and speculation turned the entire ecosystem into a slow-motion value incinerator. Attention, the only truly scarce resource in memecoins, was being diluted faster than liquidity could ever hope to concentrate. Early believers were punished by infinite new supply.

Late buyers were punished by insider bundles and sniper bots. The only consistent winners were the infrastructure providers who extracted fees on the way up and sold the SOL on the way down.

The founders of Pump.fun understood this dynamic perfectly. In June 2025, while daily revenue was already down ninety-three percent from its peak, they announced a one-billion-dollar token raise at a four-billion-dollar fully diluted valuation. The sale was marketed as fuel for “new features” and “scaling the vision.” The vision, it turned out, was to extract another billion from the same user base that had just been bled dry. The token sold out in minutes, dumped forty-six percent in hours, and now trades below its initial offering price while the founders sit on reserves that dwarf the market cap of most legitimate protocols.

This was not a company pivoting to survive. This was a victory lap for the most successful wealth transfer in retail crypto history.

Yet the deeper tragedy is not that Pump.fun extracted a billion dollars. It is that the extraction was unnecessary and, in the long run, self-defeating. Every healthy speculative market in history has eventually aligned the cost of participation with the cost of creation. When equities went electronic, bid-ask spreads collapsed. When forex went retail, spreads collapsed. When Bitcoin became liquid, exchange fees collapsed. Memecoins, uniquely, moved in the opposite direction: creation became free while participation became more expensive than trading Apple stock on Robinhood.

The intellectual scaffolding for this regression was always flimsy. Users were told they were paying a premium for “culture” and “history,” the same way a local football club sells scarves instead of building a roof over the stadium. Loyalty to a launchpad became a tribal signal the same way loyalty to a dog coin became a tribal signal. The result was a market that rewarded sentiment over efficiency and punished anyone who pointed out that rain was still falling on the spectators.

There is a way out, and it is embarrassingly obvious once you strip away the cope. Fees must become dynamic. Tokens that nobody is trading should be essentially free to buy and sell, rewarding the earliest believers and the sharpest hunters. Tokens that everyone is fighting over should carry a premium that subsidises the rest of the ecosystem. This is not charity; it is the same congestion pricing that keeps Ethereum and Bitcoin functioning during spikes. It is the same surge pricing that keeps Uber drivers on the road during a snowstorm. It is how every mature market balances supply, demand, and sustainability.

Trading terminals face an even simpler reckoning. Their marginal cost to serve one additional user is effectively zero. The first terminal that offers a credible free tier for normal-sized wallets while charging power users for latency and multi-wallet features will capture the entire flow the moment the next wave of liquidity arrives. Loyalty in the trenches has always been transactional, not emotional. When the transaction stops making sense, the loyalty evaporates overnight.

None of this requires new technology. It only requires the willingness to stop treating users like livestock. The irony is that the platforms that resist greed today will make more money tomorrow, because they will still be standing when the music starts again. The ones that cling to two-percent taxes on dying tokens will join the graveyard of 2021 yield farms and 2022 NFT marketplaces.

The memecoin casino is dead, but memecoins themselves are not. Trends still emerge. Jokes still catch fire. Communities still form around absurd inside references that somehow escape onto normie timelines. The difference is that the next wave will not tolerate a house edge that would embarrass a 1990s Las Vegas slot machine. The infrastructure that survives will be the infrastructure that finally admits the house does not need to take everything.

Users have more power than they realise. Every click, every swap, every dollar routed through a terminal is a vote. The moment those votes migrate en masse to whatever platform offers the lowest friction and the fairest split, the old giants will collapse under their own accumulated greed. It has happened before. It will happen again.

The casino lights are still flickering, but the floor is empty. The next game will be played on different tables, with different rules, and the house will finally have to compete like everyone else.

The past five years were the greatest gambling bull market in history, and memecoins were its perfect, ridiculous climax. A few hundred bucks could buy a new life if the stars aligned and you weren’t afraid to look insane.

The edge is gone because the edge is the product. What used to feel like rebellion became homework. I’m not bitter; I’m bored. The house went from taking three percent in the shadows to taking six percent in broad daylight while calling it culture. So I’m not quitting. I’m just moving tables. I’ll still fire the occasional degen dart when something actually makes me laugh. But most of my risk is shifting toward teams who want to build things that outlive the weekend, toward games where the rake is measured in basis points instead of percentage points and the house isn’t trying to own my soul.

## Conclusion

The next real bull market won’t be louder pumps; it will be cleaner games. The degenerates who spot the difference will compound forever. The rest will keep wondering why the music stopped. But the underlying phenomenon won’t die until society offers young people a realistic linear path to wealth again; perps are different because they’re structurally the best tool for speculation and will keep growing even if the clownier verticals fade. Regulation that adds guardrails without killing access is probably net positive, and prediction-market hype is mostly cope anyway.

The circus will shrink and get slightly less psychotic, but gambling with leverage is not going anywhere until the world stops being hopeless.
