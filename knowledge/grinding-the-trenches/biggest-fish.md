I’m staring at this X post that’s been rattling around timelines—some dude straight-up calling Binance thieves, parasites, saying they dump user coins to force cheap buybacks, that every wick this cycle is CZ scamming us all.

You know that feeling? When the chart rips your face off and the first thing you do is blame the big exchange. Hell, I’ve been there. Back in ‘22, I was leveraged to the tits on some alt that Binance listed with fanfare... pumped hard, then bled out slow while I watched outflows hit Wintermute wallets like clockwork. Got rekt so bad I ate ramen for a month and swore off CEX leverage forever. 

## Context

Idiot move, yeah. But that rage? It’s real. We’re all one bad trade from screaming “manipulation.” Look, I’ve dug deep on this—on-chain traces, old WSJ reports, Binance’s own statements after crashes. Here’s what I see, no polish.
> 
First off, that big one: Binance constantly dumping the market, selling user coins to crash prices and scoop ‘em cheaper. Honestly? No hard proof they routinely steal or sell deposited funds without permission. They’re custodial, sure—that means your coins sit in their wallets, not yours. Risky as hell, always has been. But proof-of-reserves audits (latest ones from late 2025) show over 100% backing on majors like BTC, ETH, SOL. Over-collateralized, even. Not FTX-level fraud where customer funds vanished into yachts.

But... those on-chain transfers? Yeah, they happen. Multiple times in 2025—Feb, Aug, Sept—Binance moves millions in ETH, SOL, BTC to Wintermute or other market makers right before dips. Community loses its mind: “Dumping!” Binance says routine liquidity ops, market makers moving for strategies. Wintermute denies manipulation every time. Could be coincidence. Could be sketchy. Kind of wild how often it lines up with pain, right? I’m not totally sold it’s innocent, but no smoking gun of them raiding user deposits.

Then the October 2025 nightmare—that $19B liquidation cascade. Biggest ever. Started with macro shock (Trump tariffs or whatever), but exploded on Binance. Their wrapped/staked assets (USDe, wBETH, BNSOL) depegged hard locally—prices printed way off reality, triggering mass liquidations at bullshit levels. Users couldn’t close positions, APIs froze, stop-losses failed. Felt targeted, like someone exploited a known vulnerability in their margin system. Binance paid out $283M in reimbursements for the depegs, then another $300-400M more to calm the storm. Admitted glitches, but denied causing the crash. 

## Main

Still... why did it hit hardest there? Gray area that keeps me up.

CZ and scamming users? Man, the guy pleaded guilty—willful AML failures, letting dirty money flow (hacks, ransomware). Paid billions in fines, did four months inside, got pardoned by Trump in ‘25 (yeah, that happened—politics, crypto ties, whatever). Serious shit, growth-over-rules vibe. But outright scamming users like SBF? No equivalent fraud charges. No proof he personally orchestrated dumps on retail. That FTX tweet accelerating their collapse? Savage, but FTX imploded from its own lies.

And those internal red flags—WSJ pieces on firing investigators probing VIP clients like DWF Labs for wash trading, pump-dumps? Raised eyebrows. Binance denied, offboarded abusers elsewhere. 

But opacity feeds the parasite talk.

Bottom line? Binance’s size means their moves ripple hard—listings pump, delistings crush, liquidity events amplify crashes. 

They’ve got power, history of cutting corners on compliance. Frustration’s valid; we’ve all felt hunted during wicks. But systematic theft of user coins to manipulate? Unproven conspiracy. More like centralized risk in a space built on “not your keys, not your crypto.” 

Accusations often from FUD in the heat, or leverage graves.

Maybe I’m wrong—could be deeper rot. Or maybe crypto’s just volatile as fuck, and the biggest player takes the blame when global pressure hits. 

## Conclusion

Me? I stack off-exchange now. Avoid high lev. Diversify spots. If Binance scares you, Coinbase is more regulated (US side), or go full DEX/Hyperliquid for perps. All CEXes have risks—remember FTX? Try this: Pull your coins to a hardware wallet tonight. Sleep better. See you on the other side of the next cycle.
