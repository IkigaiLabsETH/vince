The President of the United States has not one but two memecoins. Senators are tweeting CA’s. Your Uber driver is farming points on something called “Virtuals” while stuck in traffic. Crypto isn’t “early” anymore—it’s the new casino on the Vegas strip, except the house is a rotating cast of 22-year-old pseudonymous degens, venture capitalists, and literal heads of state, and the cocktail waitresses are all paid in tokens they’re quietly distributing at the top.

If someone onboarded you last week and handed you a list of “must-follow” Crypto Twitter accounts, congratulations: you’ve just been issued a hunting license—with your name on the prey side.

## Context

**There Is No Safe Ticker on This Timeline**

Pre-2020 you could stumble into alpha because information still moved like molasses. Today? The second a trade is profitable enough to screenshot, it’s already over. Anyone with more than ~1,000 followers posting a chart is, at best, performing a public service for their own exit liquidity and, at worst, part of an organized pump in a group chat you will never be invited to.

The bigger the account, the more likely the post you’re reading exists because:

## Main

- 
They got tokens OTC at 0.0001 and need you to pay 0.005 so they can buy a new Richard Mille.

- 
Theyturned a $3M-market-cap “first dog on Base” into weekend sport

- 
They’re literally being paid by the project

- 
They’re bagholding garbage and praying your FOMO becomes their bailout.

None of this is conspiracy. 

It’s just incentives in a permissionless, zero-accountability playground running at 100x speed. Even the “Good Ones” Will Rekt You.

I’ve lost money following people who are genuinely sharp and—even more painfully—genuinely well-meaning. The problem isn’t always malice; it’s the food chain. If you’re lower on it (and you are), someone dumps before you do. Could be the influencer, the team, the market maker, or just the macro gods deciding to nuke everything at 3 a.m. Singapore time. Doesn’t matter. You’re the exit liquidity by definition. Airdrop farming? Cleaner than microcap gambling, sure. But the KOLs still know about Season 2 mechanics, pending raises, and TGE dates before you do. You’re just renting their informational asymmetry for the price of your TVL and a boosted ref link. The Dark Ages, but With Wi-Fi

This isn’t new. Chinese stock boards call it “cutting leeks.” Wall Street has been doing it since ticker tape. The only difference is Solana lets you launch a fresh ponzi in eleven minutes and rug it before the coffee gets cold. The nobility has always hunted peasants for sport; they just used to do it with hounds instead of coordinated Telegram voice notes.

**So Should You Just Leave?**

Honestly? Most of you should. If the thought of wondering whether the person ratio-liking your comments is doing it because they like you or because they need another 400 wallets to pass the sybil filter keeps you up at night—touch grass. There are cheaper hobbies that don’t fund someone’s Lambo.

But if you’re still here, moth to flame, at least fly smarter:

- 
Spend 90% of your time reading, 10% of your money (if any) buying.

- 
Treat every ticker shilled in public like a biological weapon.

- 
Keep a private list of who pushed what and how it aged. Patterns reveal themselves fast.

- 
Have no idols. The second someone calls themselves “based” they’re selling you something—either coins or a personality cult.

- 
Use platforms like Kaito that reward engagement instead of just bag size. They’re not perfect, but at least the game isn’t 100% rigged toward people who received ten-figure airdrops in 2021.

- 
Build a small network of people as hungry and broke as you are. Real edge still exists; it’s just whispered in 6-person Discords, not screamed from 300k-follower accounts.

**Final Thought**

2025 crypto is more forgiving than 2021 in one sense: there’s so much money sloshing around that even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes. But it’s infinitely less forgiving in every other way. The predators have PhDs in memetics now. The weapons are sharper, the bags are heavier, and the referee went home years ago. Less is more. Risk less money, more time, and zero trust. The flame is beautiful. Try not to get burned to ash admiring it.

**Bitcoin: The One Asset That’s Still Allowed to Be Great**

In this clownworld of presidential memecoins, paid infographics, and Telegram hunting parties, Bitcoin is the rare grown-up in the room. It’s too big to be pumped by a 200-person group chat. Too liquid to be rugged in eleven minutes. Too battle-tested to die from one bad tweet. While everything else is vapor packaged as revolution, BTC is just scarce, unseizable money that keeps printing new all-time highs no matter who’s in office or what chain is “the Solana killer” this week. 2025’s circus doesn’t make Bitcoin worse; it makes everything else look ridiculous by comparison. The same week some anon dev is paying 47 influencers to shill his dog-wearing-sunglasses coin, Bitcoin quietly absorbs another billion from ETFs and nation-state treasuries. That contrast is the whole bull case.

So yes, whales will still shake you out on the dips and CT will still scream “bear market” at every 15% correction. That’s just noise. Zoom out and BTC is doing exactly what it’s always done: slowly, relentlessly, making the rest of crypto look like the distraction it usually is.

If you’re forced to own one thing in this casino, own the house. Everything else is just renting a chair for a few hours. Bitcoin isn’t perfect. But in a space that’s 99% extraction theater, it’s the closest thing we have to honest signal. Hold some. Sleep better. Let the rest of the timeline fight over the scraps.

**P.S. The Real Rug Pull: Banks vs. Bitcoin’s Epic Stand**

Who could rug BTC? Not some Telegram anon—it’s the banking syndicate, led by JPMorgan, that’s been straight-up 15x since the GFC, consolidating power through every administration while the Fed pulls their strings. They despise Bitcoin, DeFi, and stablecoins, architecting quiet wars like Operation Chokepoint 2.0 to choke off banking access to crypto innovators. Now, they’re squeezing MicroStrategy—Saylor’s BTC fortress—with MSCI delisting threats that could trigger billions in outflows, all while BTC tests $85K lows. 

But here’s the plot twist: 2025 is Bitcoin’s battlefield, and the good guys are stacking the deck. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (pushing for a friendlier Fed), and a potential overhaul by May could flip the script, cementing BTC as a strategic national asset. This isn’t a rug—it’s an epic showdown. In a world gone mad, Bitcoin’s the rebel holding the line. Stack sats, watch the fireworks, and bet on the underdog that’s already winning.

**The widely worshipped “4-year halving cycle” is a myth. **

Bitcoin does not have a built-in 4-year rhythm; its price has simply piggybacked on global liquidity cycles that happened to coincide with past halvings. The real driver is liquidity, and liquidity is dictated by the broader business cycle.

Key points:

- 
We just lived through the longest business-cycle contraction on record (2022–2025).
→ Global M2 barely grew, Fed QT removed ~$1.5T, rates peaked at 5.5%.
→ Result: Bitcoin never got a true parabolic expansion; it only “pushed, crabbed, retraced” instead of exploding.

- 
This cycle felt different because of massive institutional & government adoption (ETFs, MicroStrategy, U.S. Strategic Reserve, sovereign buying).
→ These new buyers provided upward pressure even while liquidity was choked → Bitcoin rose anyway, confusing cycle purists who expected a total collapse.

- 
The liquidity drought ends now.
→ Fed officially stops QT on December 1, 2025.
→ Global M2 is already turning up, China is easing aggressively, ECB/BoE poised to follow.
→ Historically, Bitcoin lags liquidity turns by 10–12 weeks and then explodes.

- 
On-chain and sentiment indicators show zero blow-off top signals:
→ MVRV Z-score ~1.0 (undervalued), Puell Multiple <1, LTH supply still near ATH, no retail FOMO, funding rates reset.

## Conclusion

We are on the exact eve of the largest liquidity easing wave of the cycle, combined with the strongest institutional bid in Bitcoin’s history. Betting on a multi-year bear market right now is betting against the single most reliable driver of risk-asset bull markets in the fiat era: expanding liquidity.

The top is not in.
The real move is still ahead.
