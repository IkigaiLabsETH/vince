# Clone X

OpenSea Slug: `clonex`

## The Artist

RTFKT Studios x Takashi Murakami. Clone X launched December 2021: 20,000 3D avatar NFTs. RTFKT (pronounced “artifact”) had already done sneakers and digital fashion; Clone X was their PFP play. Murakami brought DNA traits—skulls, flowers, his iconography—and legitimacy. Nike acquired RTFKT the same month. The Clones are rigged 3D models; you can use them in games, metaverses, or as PFPs. Eight DNA types: Human, Robot, Angel, Demon, Reptile, Undead, Murakami, Alien. ~15% have “Murakami Drip” traits. Holders get full commercial IP rights.

## Why It Matters

Clone X bridged high fashion, art, and PFPs. Murakami’s name and the Nike acquisition made it a mainstream story. The 3D rigging and IP rights made it *useful*—avatars you could actually deploy. The collection has done hundreds of thousands of ETH in volume. It’s a reference for “fashion + NFT” and “celebrity artist + PFP.” For collectors who care about utility, design, or Murakami, Clone X is essential.

## The Art

3D anime-inspired avatars. Clean, stylised, trait-driven. Outfits, hair, accessories, DNA type. Murakami traits add blossoms, skulls, his graphic language. The aesthetic is cohesive and slightly futuristic. It reads as “avatar” first, “art” second—by design.

## Notable Pieces

20,000 supply. Murakami and Alien DNA command premiums. Rare outfits and trait combos matter. Floor and volume have fluctuated. Check OpenSea for structure. The RTFKT ecosystem (other drops, Nike tie-ins) can affect demand.

## Context for Collectors

You’re buying a 3D asset and IP rights. Verify you’re on the official Clone X collection. Nike/RTFKT’s roadmap and releases can move narrative. Liquidity is strong. This is “fashion + metaverse” as much as “art.”

## Personal Take

Clone X is a benchmark for fashion–NFT crossover. Murakami’s involvement and the Nike deal gave it weight. The 3D utility is real. I’d rank it as “essential for fashion and celebrity-art PFP” but not as conceptually deep as purer art projects. Not overrated. Solid.
