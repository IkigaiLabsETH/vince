# Pursuit

OpenSea Slug: `pursuit-by-per-kristian-stoveland`

## The Artist

Per Kristian Stoveland again—generative artist, Void co-founder, The Harvest and Echo of Intensity creator. Pursuit dropped on Art Blocks (AOI Engine): 200 pieces. It’s a tighter, more focused set than The Harvest. Same artist, different system. Stoveland’s work often orbits sci‑fi, space, and atmosphere; Pursuit fits that universe. He’s been transparent about process (e.g. Art Blocks After Dinner Mints) and keeps a visible presence.

## Why It Matters

Pursuit is Stoveland doing a small, curated generative run. 200 supply means each output carries more weight than a large edition. The Harvest’s success (thousands of ETH, strong holder base) raised his profile; Pursuit benefits from that while standing on its own. For collectors who like his aesthetic, it’s a key piece. AOI Engine / Art Blocks gives it platform credibility.

## The Art

Generative. Likely atmospheric, spatial—consistent with his other work. Check the Art Blocks project page for exact behaviour and palette. Expect structure, mood, and variation within a clear system. Smaller supply usually means more curation pressure on each mint.

## Notable Pieces

200 supply. Secondary activity and floor track Stoveland’s market and Art Blocks demand. Early mints and strong compositions tend to trade higher. Lower supply can mean less liquidity but more committed holders.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks, AOI Engine. 200 fixed. If you collect Stoveland or sci‑fi generative art, Pursuit belongs on the list. Verify project page and contract before buying.

## Personal Take

Pursuit is a solid, compact Stoveland project. It doesn’t have The Harvest’s volume narrative, but it’s coherent and collectible. Good for “collect the artist” or “small-edition generative” strategies. Underrated next to The Harvest.
