# Non Either

OpenSea Slug: `non-either-by-rafael-rozendaal`

## The Artist

Rafaël Rozendaal (b. 1980, Amsterdam) is a visual artist who uses the internet as a medium. He’s done websites, installations, tapestries, lenticulars, books, talks. Work in the permanent collections of Centre Pompidou, Whitney, Stedelijk, and others. He’s been in the digital-art conversation for years. Non Either dropped on Art Blocks Presents in February 2022—100 pieces. He has other Art Blocks work across Curated, Playground, and Presents. He’s a bridge between net art and NFTs.

## Why It Matters

Non Either is Rozendaal doing generative art with a tight cap. 100 outputs, one project. His institutional history (Pompidou, Whitney) gives it a different kind of weight than most NFT-native drops. The project fits his interest in systems, chance, and the web as canvas. For collectors who care about “art world” credibility, Rozendaal is a clear link. Art Blocks Presents provided the platform; the artist brought the reputation.

## The Art

Generative. Abstraction, pattern, possibly interactivity—check the Art Blocks project page for the exact behaviour. Rozendaal’s work often feels clean and graphic; expect structure and variation within a clear system. 100 pieces means each one matters.

## Notable Pieces

100 supply. Secondary volume and floor track Rozendaal’s broader market and Art Blocks demand. Small supply typically means lower liquidity but strong holder commitment. Early or visually striking mints tend to trade at a premium.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Presents. 100 fixed. You’re buying Rozendaal as much as the algorithm. If you collect net art or institution-backed digital art, Non Either is a logical target. Verify the project page and contract before buying.

## Personal Take

Non Either is a serious artist doing a small, focused generative set. It won’t dominate headlines, but it’s the kind of project that belongs in a “net art + NFTs” canon. Rozendaal’s name and Presents’ curation make it a credible hold. Underrated in purely crypto-native circles; better recognised by people who track both worlds.
