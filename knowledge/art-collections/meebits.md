# Meebits

OpenSea Slug: `meebits`

## The Artist

Larva Labs again—Matt Hall and John Watkinson. After Punks and Autoglyphs, they built Meebits: 20,000 generative 3D voxel avatars, launched May 2021. The idea was a 3D successor to Punks—characters you could actually use in games, virtual worlds, and animation. Each Meebit is fully rigged; you get a T-pose OBJ. The generator draws on their game-dev experience. Character types include humans, pigs, elephants, robots, skeletons, and “visitors.” Sold out in an afternoon. Larva eventually sold the IP to Yuga Labs (2022); Yuga later passed it to MeebCo (2025), which now does merchandise, 3D prints, and public art.

## Why It Matters

Meebits bridged PFP culture and “usable” 3D assets. The integrated marketplace in the contract allowed multi-asset trades—e.g. three Meebits plus ETH for a rarer one—which felt novel at the time. In practice, OpenSea and other platforms absorbed most of the liquidity. The real legacy is the format: voxel, rigged, ready for virtual worlds. They also extended the Larva Labs mythos. Not as foundational as Punks or as conceptually sharp as Autoglyphs, but culturally significant. The Yuga and MeebCo handoffs have left some purists uneasy; the collection’s identity has evolved.

## The Art

3D voxel characters. Blocky, low-poly, algorithmically assembled. Traits include clothing, accessories, algorithmic tattoos. The aesthetic is deliberately game-like—Minecraft-adjacent rather than high-rez realism. Some are cute; some are odd. Rarity exists but matters less than “it’s a Meebit” for many holders.

## Notable Pieces

20,000 supply. Rare types (e.g. visitors, certain species) and strong trait combos trade at a premium. The collection has done substantial volume over the years. Check OpenSea for current floor and activity. MeebCo’s merchandise and IRL projects add a dimension beyond the token.

## Context for Collectors

IP and development have moved from Larva → Yuga → MeebCo. If you care about “original Larva,” that ship has sailed. The OBJ files are a real utility—use them in engines, print them, animate them. Verify you’re buying the Ethereum Meebits collection, not a derivative or bridge.

## Personal Take

Meebits are the middle child of Larva Labs. Less historic than Punks, less intellectually satisfying than Autoglyphs—but they opened a lane for 3D PFPs and usable assets. The marketplace mechanic was cool; the execution was messy. I’d still rank them as “should know” for anyone tracking NFT history. Not overrated, not underrated. They’re there.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
