# WaVyScApE

OpenSea Slug: `wavyscape-by-holger-lippmann`

## The Artist

Holger Lippmann studied at the Dresden and Stuttgart academies and has been working with Processing since 2005. WaVyScApE came from a trip through the Alps—rolling hills, cloud banks, the rhythm of the landscape. The project was built in Processing/p5.js with image and vector output; Jesse Rogers provided technical support. It dropped on Art Blocks (Presents) on 1 February 2023. Lippmann has other work in the Fingerprints Studio orbit.

## Why It Matters

WaVyScApE is generative landscape as abstraction. Softly morphing blobs move horizontally and leave trails, building layered, quasi-3D forms. Colour comes from staggered fields—partly predefined palettes mixed with white and grayscale. Lippmann has described it as reminiscent of thawing snow in spring, when colour and form suddenly appear. The pieces are vector-based, so they scale without loss. It’s a clear, single-concept project: wave, motion, emergence.

## The Art

Generative. Flowing horizontal motion, trails, layered colour fields. The look is soft and organic—landscape distilled into gesture. Palettes range from muted to brighter; the “thaw” quality gives it a seasonal, almost hopeful feel. Check the Art Blocks project page for full range.

## Notable Pieces

Supply and secondary activity depend on the Art Blocks release. Check OpenSea and the project page. Lippmann’s reputation and the accessible aesthetic support collector interest.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Presents. Verify supply and contract. If you like landscape-inspired generative art that stays abstract, WaVyScApE is a good fit. Vector output is a plus for prints or large display.

## Personal Take

WaVyScApE is a focused, elegant project. The Alpine inspiration reads without being literal. It’s not as headline as Fidenza or Ringers, but it holds up. Good for “nature + algorithm” collectors. Underrated.
