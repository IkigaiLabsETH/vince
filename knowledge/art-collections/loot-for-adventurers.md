# Loot (for Adventurers)

OpenSea Slug: `loot-for-adventurers`

## The Artist

Dom Hofmann—Vine co-founder, builder of odd experiments. Loot launched in August 2021. No images. Just text. Eight lines per bag, each line an adventurer item: “Divine Robe of the Fox,” “Short Sword,” “Amulet,” etc. Randomised. Free to claim (gas only). 8,000 bags. The idea was provocation: what if the *data* was the NFT and the art was whatever the community built on top? Stats, images, games—all optional. Loot is the primitive. Everything else is derivative.

## Why It Matters

Loot pioneered “composable” NFTs as a design philosophy. The bags are building blocks. People built stats, images, games, whole worlds. The project spawned a “Lootverse”—adventurers, maps, guilds. Hofmann didn’t ship a finished product; he shipped a schema and let the market interpret it. That bottom-up, creator-owned approach influenced everything from Nouns to CC0 culture. Some bags sold for 250+ ETH. The collection did tens of millions in volume. Then the hype faded. The *idea* stuck. You can’t tell the “NFTs as infrastructure” story without Loot.

## The Art

Text. Black background, white type. Eight item slots: weapon, chest, head, hand, waist, foot, ring, neck. Rarity is algorithmic—some items appear once across all 8,000 bags. No pictures. The “art” is the list, the interpretation, and the community that built on it.

## Notable Pieces

**Bag #1–100** — Genesis range. Historical premium.

**High-rarity bags** — Unique or near-unique item combos. Check Loot-based tools and OpenSea for structure. Floor and volume have cooled from 2021 peaks; the project is more “reference” than “trade” for many.

## Context for Collectors

You’re buying a text NFT. No artwork in the token—just the contract and the provenance. The value is narrative, historical, and “Lootverse” participation. Liquidity is thinner than PFPs. If you care about composability and crypto-native design, Loot is essential. If you want pretty pictures, look elsewhere.

## Personal Take

Loot is one of the most important “what if?” projects in NFTs. It failed as a lasting tradeable asset for most people; it succeeded as a concept. I’d put it in the same bucket as Autoglyphs for “ideas that matter more than the secondary market.” Underrated as design; overrated as a flip. If you’re building a “greatest hits” of NFT *ideas*, Loot belongs. If you’re building a portfolio of assets that print, maybe not.
