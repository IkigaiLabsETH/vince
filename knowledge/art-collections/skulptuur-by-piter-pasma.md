# Skulptuur

OpenSea Slug: `skulptuur-by-piter-pasma`

## The Artist

Piter Pasma is a Dutch generative artist from Groningen. He came up in the demoscene in the late ’90s under the handle “Ritz”—code, visuals, music, the whole package. He’s been making algorithmic art since then, on Hic Et Nunc, Foundation, FX(hash), and elsewhere. Skulptuur hit Art Blocks in September 2021. He’s part of a generation that moved from demo culture into NFTs without losing the “build it tight” mindset. His work is minimal in code, maximal in effect.

## Why It Matters

Skulptuur showed that 3D generative art could sit inside Art Blocks’ constraints. Otherworldly sculptural forms, complex virtual lighting, all from a 6,370-byte program. The renders improve in real time in the live view; you can tune speed with keys 0–7. It’s WebGL2-based and compute-heavy—the project asks something of your machine. That rawness is part of the appeal. It feels like demoscene heritage meeting curated NFT art.

The collection has done solid volume (thousands of ETH) and holds a clear niche: 3D, sculptural, single-artist, Art Blocks Curated. It’s not as auction-heavy as Ringers or Fidenza, but it has a dedicated collector base.

## The Art

Algorithmic 3D sculptures. Abstract forms—organic, geometric, or in between—lit by virtual environments. No literal objects; everything is generated. The lighting does a lot of the work: mood, depth, contrast. Outputs range from stark and minimal to dense and intricate. The code is tiny; the variety comes from parameter space. You need a capable machine and a WebGL2 browser to see them as intended.

## Notable Pieces

Skulptuur doesn’t have a single “Goose”-level headline sale, but the collection has traded consistently. Floor has often been in the 0.3–0.5 ETH range; total volume is in the thousands of ETH. Certain compositions and lighting setups command premiums. With 1,000 pieces and ~52% unique ownership, there’s a real spread of holders rather than a few whales hoarding.

## Context for Collectors

1,000 pieces. Art Blocks Curated. Fixed supply. Creator fees (e.g. 7.5%) apply on secondary.

People collect Skulptuur for the 3D aesthetic, the demoscene pedigree, and the “small code, big output” ethos. It’s more niche than Fidenza or Ringers but has a clear identity. If you care about generative 3D and Art Blocks, it’s a key project. Just make sure you can actually run the viewer before you buy.

## Personal Take

Skulptuur is underrated in the broader “Art Blocks canon” conversation. It doesn’t have the same auction runway as Ringers or the same crossover appeal as Squiggles, but the work is strong and the technical story is compelling. Pasma packed a lot into 6K bytes.

If you’re into 3D generative art or demoscene history, Skulptuur deserves a place on your list. It’s not a safe, consensus blue chip—it’s a sharpen-your-taste pick. I like it for exactly that reason.
