# Yamabushi’s Horizons

OpenSea Slug: `yamabushi-s-horizons-by-richard-nadler`

## The Artist

Richard Nadler again. Yamabushi’s Horizons (2023) explores the lives of Japan’s mountain hermits—yamabushi, practitioners of shugendō on the Dewa Sanzan. Nadler uses AI-generated landscapes, trained on books, stories, and his own travel photos, to visualise that tradition. The project has done $270K+ in secondary sales. It’s part of his Japan-centred practice alongside Izanami Islands, Kinoko Dreams, and Ronin. His father’s death at 18 and their shared Japan trips underpin much of his work; Yamabushi’s Horizons channels that into spiritual terrain.

## Why It Matters

Yamabushi’s Horizons bridges spiritual tradition and AI art. The yamabushi aren’t caricature—they’re a real practice. Nadler treats them with respect. The market response ($270K+) and the conceptual clarity make it a standout in his catalogue. For collectors who care about Japan, spirituality, or landscape-as-memory, it’s a strong fit. The “horizons” framing—distance, aspiration, limit—lands.

## The Art

AI-generated landscape. Mountains, mist, suggestion of figures or paths. The aesthetic is likely atmospheric and slightly embroidered (per his usual style). Colour and composition vary. The mood is contemplative, rooted in place and practice.

## Notable Pieces

Supply and structure depend on the release. Secondary volume is significant. Check OpenSea, Verse, and Nadler’s channels for exact numbers and activity.

## Context for Collectors

Verify platform and contract. Don’t confuse with Izanami or Kinoko. If you collect Nadler or Japan-themed NFT art, Yamabushi’s Horizons is essential.

## Personal Take

Yamabushi’s Horizons is Nadler at his most spiritually attuned. The sales reflect real demand. Underrated next to flashier generative projects; essential for his oeuvre. Worth a close look.
