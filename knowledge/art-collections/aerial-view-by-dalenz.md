# Aerial View

OpenSea Slug: `aerial-view-by-dalenz`

## The Artist

daLenz. Aerial View is an Art Blocks Curated project from 2020. It was **lot 19**—the **last** of the 19 works—in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021). The name suggests top-down or elevated perspective; the output is algorithmically generated. daLenz’s broader practice is less documented, but the project closes the canonical Natively Digital set.

## Why It Matters

Aerial View is the final piece of the foundational Sotheby’s Art Blocks lot. That sale marked generative art’s entry into major auctions; every project in the 19 shares that legacy. As the closing work, it’s symbolically part of the set’s bookend.

## The Art

Generative. “Aerial view” implies landscape, map-like, or elevated structure. Aesthetic and traits vary by seed. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

Art Blocks Curated. Supply fixed. Check secondary for activity. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Essential for Natively Digital completeness.

## Personal Take

Aerial View is an underrated closer for the 2021 set. Worth knowing for collectors who care about the full Sotheby’s story.
