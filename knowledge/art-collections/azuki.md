# Azuki

OpenSea Slug: `azuki`

## The Artist

Chiru Labs—a Los Angeles Web3 studio. Azuki launched 12 January 2022: 8,700 anime-style PFPs at ~$3,400 each. Sold out in three minutes, ~$29M primary. The art blends Japanese anime with street style. Chiru built ERC-721A (gas-efficient minting) and pushed narrative and brand hard. Azuki quickly hit ~$300M volume in four weeks, outpacing BAYC and Punks at the time. The project has since expanded with Elementals, animated series (*Enter The Garden*, 2024, with Goro Taniguchi), and a clear “entertainment company” pivot. Strong anime and collector base.

## Why It Matters

Azuki proved that anime could dominate NFT PFP culture. The aesthetic was distinct—not apes, not punks—and the execution was polished. ERC-721A influenced later drops. The brand built fast: partnerships, anime, roadmap. Chiru turned it into a “next-gen entertainment” story. The 2022 run was parabolic; the market corrected, but Azuki stayed relevant. For collectors who care about anime, design, and brand-led projects, Azuki is a benchmark.

## The Art

Anime avatars. Streetwear, hoodies, skater vibes. Clean lines, limited palette, high polish. Traits include gear, expressions, backgrounds. The look is cohesive—you know an Azuki when you see one. Less “cute” than some anime NFT projects, more attitude.

## Notable Pieces

8,700 supply (plus Elementals and later drops). Rare traits and “golden” skintones command premiums. Floor and volume have fluctuated with the market. Check OpenSea for current activity. The anime and entertainment expansion add narrative layers.

## Context for Collectors

Azuki has multiple related collections (Elementals, etc.). Verify you’re buying the flagship Azuki set. Chiru’s roadmap and anime releases can move sentiment. Liquidity is solid. You’re buying brand and aesthetic as much as “art.”

## Personal Take

Azuki nailed anime PFP before it was oversaturated. The quality and the ERC-721A move mattered. I’m less interested in the entertainment pivot than in the original drop—but the project has held attention. Not overrated. Essential for anime-NFT history.
