# Doodles

OpenSea Slug: `doodles-official`

## The Artist

Doodles LLC. Burnt Toast (Scott Martin)—illustrator for Google, Snapchat, WhatsApp—created the art. Evan Keast and Jordan Castro (ex–Dapper Labs) handled product and community. Launched October 2021: 10,000 pastel PFPs, 0.123 ETH presale. Public mint sent gas over 1 ETH. The team built a “community-driven” ethos: Discord, roadmap input, collector focus. Doodles later pivoted to “entertainment company”—music, content, IRL, partnerships (McDonald’s, Adidas). The aesthetic is cheerful, inclusive, slightly naive. It stood out in a sea of apes and punks.

## Why It Matters

Doodles proved that pastel, positive vibes could compete with edgier PFPs. The founder credentials and the community build (presale, Discord) created loyalty. The entertainment pivot—vinyl, exhibitions, brand deals—extended the franchise. It’s less “flex” than BAYC, more “vibes and access.” The project has stayed visible through ups and downs. For collectors who want “light” PFP culture and clear brand evolution, Doodles is a key reference.

## The Art

Pastel characters. Simple shapes, soft colours, big eyes. Traits: bodies, faces, outfits, props. The style is cohesive and instantly recognisable. It’s deliberately approachable—family-friendly, shareable. Less “rare” feeling than many blue chips, more “collectible.”

## Notable Pieces

10,000 supply. Rare traits and community favourites trade higher. Floor and volume have shifted with the market and Doodles 2 / expansion. Check OpenSea for current activity. The entertainment and partnership narrative can move sentiment.

## Context for Collectors

Doodles has expanded (Doodles 2, etc.). Verify you’re buying the original 10k collection. The team’s entertainment focus means roadmap and drops matter. Liquidity is solid. You’re buying brand and community as much as the image.

## Personal Take

Doodles earned its place. The aesthetic is distinct; the team executed. I’m less invested in the entertainment pivot than in the original drop—but the project has held. Not overrated. Worth knowing for “vibes” PFP culture.
