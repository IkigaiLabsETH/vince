# CryptoPunks

OpenSea Slug: `cryptopunks`

## The Creators

Larva Labs - Matt Hall and John Watkinson, two software developers who weren't trying to create a cultural phenomenon. They just wanted to make something weird with code. The punk aesthetic came from London punk rock, cyberpunk, and Daft Punk. 10,000 algorithmically generated 24x24 pixel portraits, minted in June 2017, given away for free to anyone with an Ethereum wallet.

## Why It Matters

Punks essentially invented the PFP. Before NFTs were a thing, before OpenSea existed in any meaningful form, before "web3" was a term anyone used - Punks existed. They predate CryptoKitties. They predate the 2017 ICO boom. They're on an immutable record of that specific moment when a handful of weirdos thought putting art on Ethereum might be interesting.

Culturally, they became the status symbol of crypto wealth. Visa bought one. Snoop bought one. Every crypto fund that made it through 2021 had Punks on their balance sheet. They're less about the art (which is deliberately crude) and more about what owning one signals.

## The Art

8-bit portraits at 24x24 pixels. The constraints are the point. No fancy resolution, no animation, no gimmicks. Just a tight pixel grid forcing every creative decision into an extremely limited canvas. The types: Humans, Zombies, Apes, and Aliens (increasingly rare in that order). Aliens are the grails - only 9 exist.

The traits are simple: hats, glasses, facial hair, cigarettes, earrings. Some combinations are rarer than others. Some are ugly on purpose. Some have a weird elegance despite the low resolution.

## Notable Pieces

**Punk #7804** - One of 9 Aliens. Sold for $7.5M in 2021. Pipe-smoking alien with a forward cap. Became the go-to example when explaining NFT valuations to normies.

**Punk #3100** - Another Alien. Headband only. Ultra-minimalist. Sold for 4200 ETH.

**Punk #8857** - Zombie with 3D glasses. Aesthetically one of the coolest pieces, sold for 2000+ ETH.

## Context for Collectors

Floor Punks (the least rare combination of traits) have historically been the "entry" to the collection, but floor still means generational blue chip pricing. There's a persistent debate about whether the actual image matters or if you're just buying the status.

The rare types (Aliens, Apes, Zombies) trade in a completely different market than the floor. Aliens especially - they're more like Picassos, traded between whales.

Larva Labs transferred IP and ownership to Yuga Labs in 2022. Some purists didn't love this. Yuga also opened commercial rights to holders, which was new.

## Personal Take

Punks are the TCP/IP of NFTs. They're not the prettiest thing ever made, and the actual technical implementation (the wrapper, the bidding system) was primitive. But they were first, and in this space, being first with something culturally sticky matters enormously.

From a pure art perspective, I think Autoglyphs is the more interesting Larva Labs project. But Punks are the cultural artifact. They're digital Warhols - the value is as much about what they represent as what they actually look like.

If you're collecting Punks, you're collecting history. That's either worth everything or nothing to you.
