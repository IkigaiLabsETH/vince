# Gazers

OpenSea Slug: `gazers-by-matt-kane`

## The Artist

Matt Kane. Gazers is an Art Blocks Curated project—generative art synced to the moon. Each NFT has an “Origin Moon,” a date from the past 20 years tied to moments in Kane’s practice. The work evolves over time: animation frame rate increases with each lunar cycle. An old Origin Moon might run at 20 fps; a new mint, ~1 fps, like a slowly evolving painting. Layers shift daily at midnight—colour, line weight, direction. Kane nods to the first lunar calendar (32,000 BC) and asks what we’ll make of this moment in crypto. Living artwork, meant to run continuously.

## Why It Matters

Gazers proved that generative NFTs could be _temporal_—tied to real-world cycles, not just static outputs. The moon sync and the daily updates create a shared, evolving context. Kane’s ambition (astronomy, colour, collective metaphor) lands. The project is a reference for “living” generative art. For collectors who care about time-based work and concept, Gazers is essential.

## The Art

Generative. Lunar, abstract. Patterns pulse and shift; colour and line evolve. The aesthetic is contemplative, cosmic. Outputs vary by Origin Moon and seed. Check gazers.art and Art Blocks for the full behaviour.

## Notable Pieces

Supply is fixed (Art Blocks Curated). Certain Origin Moons and compositions trade higher. Kane’s name and the mechanic support demand. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. The piece is designed to be displayed continuously. Verify project and contract. If you like time-based or lunar generative work, Gazers is a must.

## Personal Take

Gazers is one of the most conceptually ambitious Art Blocks projects. The moon sync isn’t a gimmick—it’s structural. Underrated. Worth a close look.
