# Sketchbook A

OpenSea Slug: `sketchbook-a-by-william-mapan-1`

## The Artist

William Mapan is a Paris-based artist and coder. He works across Art Blocks (Anticyclone, 1935), fx(hash) (Dragons), Verse (Sketchbook series via SOLOS), and has been featured at Christie’s and Sotheby’s. Sketchbook A (2023) leans into crayon and coloured-pencil–style digital sketches—childhood creativity, play, spontaneity. Sketchbook B (2025) builds on that with more introspection and refined geometry. The Sketchbook series sits alongside Strands of Solitude and his other generative work; the “sketchbook” framing implies experimentation and intimacy.

## Why It Matters

Sketchbook A showed that generative art could feel hand-made and whimsical. The crayon/pencil aesthetic isn’t literal—it’s algorithmic—but the mood is warm and accessible. Mapan often injects “humanness” into code; Sketchbook A is that idea in pure form. For collectors who like generative art with a personal, almost diary-like quality, it’s a key project. The supply structure (check project) and platform (Verse/Art Blocks–adjacent) affect how it trades.

## The Art

Generative “sketches.” Loose lines, layered colour, informal composition. The look echoes crayon or coloured pencil—slightly rough, playful. Outputs vary in density and palette. The overall feel is personal and exploratory rather than cold or systematic.

## Notable Pieces

Supply and structure depend on the drop (Sketchbook A vs B, platform). Check Verse, Art Blocks, and OpenSea for exact numbers and secondary activity. Mapan’s name and the Sketchbook narrative support demand.

## Context for Collectors

Verify which Sketchbook (A or B) and which platform you’re buying. Mapan has multiple Sketchbook-related releases. If you collect his work or “human-feel” generative art, Sketchbook A is essential.

## Personal Take

Sketchbook A is Mapan at his most approachable. The constraint (sketch-like, playful) works. It’s not as conceptual as Strands of Solitude, but it’s coherent and collectible. Good for “warm generative” fans. Underrated.
