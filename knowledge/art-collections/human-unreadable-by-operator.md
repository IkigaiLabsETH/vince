# Human Unreadable

OpenSea Slug: `human-unreadable-by-operator`

## The Artist

Operator is the artist duo Ania Catherine and Dejha Ti. They work across installation, performance, and digital media. Human Unreadable landed on Art Blocks Curated in May 2023—400 pieces. It’s a three-act work that folds together code, choreography, blockchain, and generative art. Each output is driven by motion data: “choreohashes” derived from token randomness. So the art isn’t just visual; it’s tied to movement. Act 2 lets collectors reveal a unique movement sequence on the Operator site—a score, soulbound to their token. The first 100 mints (#2–#101) had their sequences performed IRL at an institution. 10% of primary went to activating generative choreography at a non-profit. It’s part of their “Privacy” arc.

## Why It Matters

Human Unreadable is rare: generative art that explicitly bridges body and chain. The choreographic layer isn’t a gimmick; it’s structural. You get an image _and_ a movement score. The IRL performance for the first 100 mints made ownership tangible. Operator are serious about embodiment and privacy; this project carries that into NFTs. It expanded what “generative” can mean on Art Blocks.

## The Art

Six main visual families. Human figures, glass, transparency, light, x-ray-like elements. The look is slick and contemporary—fine-art adjacent. The generative variation comes from the choreohash; each piece maps to a different movement sequence. The aesthetic is recognisably Operator: clean, conceptual, body-aware.

## Notable Pieces

400 supply. Dutch auction from 5 ETH down to 0.16 ETH at mint. First 100 mints have the performance link. Secondary favours those and visually strong outputs. The soulbound movement score adds a dimension that pure pixel projects don’t have.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. 400 fixed. If you care about performance, embodiment, or conceptual overlap between dance and code, Human Unreadable is singular. Use the Operator site to unlock your sequence. The project rewards engagement, not just flipping.

## Personal Take

Human Unreadable is one of the most conceptually interesting Art Blocks projects. Operator didn’t just make another generative set—they wired movement and performance into the token. It’s underrated in “greatest Curated drops” discussions. If you like art that crosses physical and digital, it’s essential.
