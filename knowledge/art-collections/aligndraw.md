# alignDRAW

OpenSea Slug: `aligndraw`

## The Artist

Elman Mansimov built alignDRAW in 2015 when he was 19. It’s one of the first—often called the first—text-to-image models. Before DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion, alignDRAW turned language into pictures. The model learned to align text descriptions with generated images. The outputs are 32×32 pixels, rough and dreamlike. Mansimov minted them fully on-chain in 2023; the collection launched via Christie’s, Fellowship, and OpenSea. Historic files, historic idea.

## Why It Matters

alignDRAW is a landmark in AI art. It solved the reverse of image-to-text: prompt in, image out. The comparison to early photography (1826–1827) is occasionally overused, but the directional point holds—this is early text-to-image, preserved and now collectible. The Papers (168 images from 21 prompts, 8 each) and Process (2,541 from 21 prompts, 121 each) groups structure the set. Christie’s and Fellowship validated it as serious art, not just a tech demo.

## The Art

32×32 pixel outputs. Low-res, suggestive rather than crisp. You see shapes, hints of objects, sometimes “A stop sign is flying in blue skies”-style literalism, often abstraction. The aesthetic is primitive by today’s standards; the importance is historical. Each image is tied to a specific prompt and stored on-chain.

## Notable Pieces

“A stop sign is flying in blue skies” and other iconic prompts have been auctioned. The collection has done thousands of ETH in volume; floor has often sat around 0.4–0.5 ETH. Paper vs. Process, and specific prompts, affect desirability.

## Context for Collectors

~2,700 pieces across Paper and Process. You’re buying a slice of AI-art history. The images won’t wow anyone used to modern gen models—they’re collectible because of *when* and *what* they are. If that matters to you, alignDRAW is essential.

## Personal Take

alignDRAW deserves its place in the canon. It’s not the most visually striking collection, but it’s one of the most historically significant. If you care about AI art, text-to-image, or “firsts,” it belongs in the conversation. Underrated as art, correctly rated as history.
