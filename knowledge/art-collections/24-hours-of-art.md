# 24 Hours of Art

OpenSea Slug: `24-hours-of-art`

## The Artist

Roger Dickerman (RD) runs 24 Hours of Art—a daily independent report on digital art and NFT marketplaces. The project became an evolving NFT collection on Ethereum using Transient Labs’ ERC-7160 standard. Each token represents a day. Tokens start as blank canvases and update over the year with art tied to that day’s events; by year-end they’re finalised as dynamic artworks. Subscriber tokens (e.g. 2026) also get daily reports via email. There’s a Telegram community, weekly shows, macro recaps, allowlists, and other perks. It’s art, journalism, and membership in one.

## Why It Matters

24 Hours of Art turned “daily coverage” into a collectible. You’re not just reading—you own a token that morphs with the year. The 2024 run had 366 tokens (one per day), 0.24 ETH each, sold out 1 Feb 2024. The 2023 token #1 auction went to chikai.eth for 2.31 ETH. The model blurs report, artwork, and community. For people who care about digital art discourse, it’s a direct way to support it and hold a piece of the timeline.

## The Art

Evolving. Each token updates across the year; the final form reflects that year’s events. The look is determined by RD’s design system and the daily input—so it’s editorial as much as generative. Expect graphics, typography, and day-specific visual hooks. The “blank → filled” arc is part of the piece.

## Notable Pieces

366 (2024) or 365 (other years) per run. Token #1 and key dates often trade at a premium. Subscriber tokens (e.g. 2026) have their own structure. Check 24hours.art and Transient for current drops and portal access.

## Context for Collectors

Understand what you’re buying: a day token vs. a subscription token, which year, and what updates remain. The community perks (Telegram, allowlists, etc.) are part of the value. Verify contract and platform.

## Personal Take

24 Hours of Art is a clever fusion of reporting and collectibles. The evolving canvas and the daily link to “what happened” make it distinctive. If you follow digital art and want to support that coverage, it’s a meaningful way in. Not a traditional art NFT—more “media + membership + art.” Worth knowing.
