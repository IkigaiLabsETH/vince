# Pink. Unidentified. Such a Useless Color!

OpenSea Slug: `pink-such-a-useless-color-by-simon-raion`

## The Artist

Simon Raion (Simon Lavi) has worked in digital and post-photography mise en scène for two decades and is an early practitioner of post-photography AI art. “Pink. Unidentified. Such a Useless Color!” dropped in April 2023. The images are presented as C Prints on Fujiflex Crystal Archive; physical editions are limited to 5 copies each (78.5 × 101.6 cm). The work tackles overcrowding, alienation, and the “ubiquitous but unseen Other” through surreal scenes: pink figures, a pink car “going nowhere.” References run to Hopper, Bosch, and the Marx Brothers—stagnant, crowded spaces that could be sweatshops, wards, shantytowns, dorm rooms, or industrial decay. Pink is used to question gender-coded colour and refusal of easy categorization.

## Why It Matters

The project uses pink as concept, not decoration. It’s deliberately unsettling—surreal, crowded, unresolved. The physical component (C Print, 5 eds) ties NFTs to traditional photo editioning. Raion’s history in post-photography and AI gives it credibility. For collectors who care about photo-based NFT art with a clear critical stance, it’s a standout. The title alone is a statement.

## The Art

Photography (with possible AI/post-photography elements). Surreal, staged. Pink-dressed figures, pink car, cluttered or institutional spaces. The mood is odd, slightly comic, vaguely oppressive. Colour is the throughline.

## Notable Pieces

Edition structure: 5 physical copies per image; NFT layer as per the drop. Check Fellowship, Mintify, and OpenSea for the exact NFT setup, supply, and secondary activity.

## Context for Collectors

Understand what you’re buying: NFT only, or NFT + physical. Verify platform and contract. The work is conceptually dense; it rewards slow looking. Not a “vibes only” pick.

## Personal Take

“Pink. Unidentified. Such a Useless Color!” is one of the sharper photo-driven NFT projects. The title and the Hopper/Bosch vibes land. Raion knows what he’s doing. Underrated in broader NFT discourse; essential for photo and concept collectors.
