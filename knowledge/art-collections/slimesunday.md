# Slimesunday

OpenSea Slug: `slimesunday`

## The Artist

Slimesunday—collage artist, music-adjacent. Known for vivid, layered work and collaborations (e.g. Steve Aoki). The “slimesunday” slug typically refers to their NFT output across platforms. The style blends digital collage, pop culture, and high-energy visuals. They’re part of the broader “crypto art” wave that brought traditional digital artists on-chain. The plugin lists them in Tier 4; significance centres on collage, music crossover, and recognisable aesthetic.

## Why It Matters

Slimesunday represents the bridge between club culture, collage art, and NFTs. The Steve Aoki tie-ins and the graphic, punchy style created a distinct lane. For collectors who care about collage, music-adjacent art, and that 2021 wave of “artist enters NFTs,” Slimesunday is a reference. The work is more “design and vibe” than fine-art reverent—which is the point.

## The Art

Digital collage. Layered, colourful, often pop or music-referential. The aesthetic is bold and shareable. Output varies by piece and drop. Check OpenSea and their channels for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

Supply and structure depend on the specific collection or drop. Verify what “slimesunday” denotes—artist page vs. distinct set. Check OpenSea for activity.

## Context for Collectors

Confirm which collection or 1/1 you’re buying. Multi-platform. You’re buying the artist and the collage aesthetic. Liquidity varies.

## Personal Take

Slimesunday occupies a clear niche—collage, music, energy. Not overrated. Worth knowing for that slice of NFT art.
