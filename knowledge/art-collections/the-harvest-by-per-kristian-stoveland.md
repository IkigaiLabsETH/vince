# The Harvest

OpenSea Slug: `the-harvest-by-per-kristian-stoveland`

## The Artist

Per Kristian Stoveland is a visual artist and co-founder of Void, a design studio in Oslo. He grew up in Kenya and Zimbabwe before moving back to Norway as a teenager. His background spans generative art and old-school Flash; he’s been making procedural work for a long time. The Harvest hit Art Blocks Curated in January 2023. He’s also behind Pursuit. His references run to sci‑fi, space art, and illustrators like Hugh Ferriss and Michael Whelan—big, atmospheric, cosmic.

## Why It Matters

The Harvest is unabashed sci‑fi generative art. Alien worlds, a cosmic “Caretaker,” colossal chromatic beams hitting planetary surfaces to harvest resources in an endless cycle. It’s about scale and awe—how small we are next to the cosmos. The algorithm uses p5.js and its 3D API: orthogonal view, volumetric rectangular units, stylised terrain. Beams have procedural position, colour, reach, and yield, drawn over time. It feels like a screenshot from a universe we’ll never visit.

The project did serious volume (thousands of ETH) and found a real collector base. It showed that narrative, worldbuilding generative art could hold its own on Art Blocks alongside more abstract work.

## The Art

Alien landscapes. Horizontal strata, dramatic light, monumental beams from above. Palette shifts from piece to piece—cool and eerie, or warm and molten. The aesthetic is illustrational rather than purely geometric; you can imagine these as book or game art. Dense and atmospheric.

## Notable Pieces

500 supply. Floor has often been around 1–2 ETH; total volume in the thousands of ETH. Certain beam configurations, colour schemes, and “world” types command premiums. Early mints and obvious standouts trade higher. Stoveland’s name and the sci‑fi angle keep interest up.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. 500 pieces, fixed. If you like generative art with a clear narrative and a space-opera vibe, The Harvest is a strong fit. Check the 3D view on Art Blocks to see how your piece animates. Some outputs are busier than others; preference is aesthetic as much as trait-based.

## Personal Take

The Harvest is a love letter to sci‑fi done right. Stoveland isn’t hiding behind abstraction—he’s building worlds. The market response (volume, holder base) suggests it landed. I’d put it in the “should know” tier of Art Blocks: not as canonical as Fidenza or Ringers, but distinctive and memorable. If you collect generative art with a story, this belongs on the list.
