# Curio Cards

OpenSea Slug: `curio-cards`

## The Artist

Seven artists, one project. Travis Uhrig, Thomas Hunt, and Rhett Creighton launched Curio Cards on **9 May 2017** as an online gallery show. Thirty unique digital artworks, each in a numbered series with fixed supply (111–2,267 cards per series). Total ~29.7k cards; an estimated 4k are lost or destroyed. Initially $1 each; proceeds went to artists. The collection predates the ERC-721 standard. The team embedded artwork via IPFS hashes in smart contracts and used non-divisible tokens with fixed supply—ideas that later shaped ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Curio Cards are widely considered the **first art NFT project on Ethereum**.

## Why It Matters

Curio Cards are the first. Before CryptoPunks, before the 2017 ICO summer, they proved you could pair digital art with on-chain tokens on Ethereum. The technical choices—IPFS, fixed supply, non-fungibility—became blueprints. In October 2021, a full set including the “17b” misprint sold at Christie’s Post-War to Present for $1.2M (393 ETH), Christie’s first auction settled entirely in ETH. The project is historical infrastructure. If you care about “first art on Ethereum,” Curio Cards are it.

## The Art

Thirty distinct pieces across seven artists. Styles vary—digital illustration, generative, graphic. Each series has its own look. The constraint was “gallery show as tokens”; the output is deliberately diverse. The “17b” misprint is a known variant; full sets typically include it.

## Notable Pieces

**Full set + 17b** — $1.2M at Christie’s, October 2021. The benchmark.

Individual series and low numbers carry premiums. Rarity and historical significance both matter. Check curio.cards and OpenSea for structure and secondary activity.

## Context for Collectors

Supply is fixed; many cards are lost. You’re buying early Ethereum art history. Liquidity is moderate; the collector base is specialised. Verify you’re on the canonical Curio contract. Documentation and community resources exist (e.g. docs.curio.cards).

## Personal Take

Curio Cards are the TCP/IP of Ethereum art NFTs. They’re not the flashiest images—they’re the proof that it could work. Underrated in pop NFT discourse; correctly celebrated by historians. If you’re building a “foundational” collection, Curio Cards belong. Not overrated. Essential.
