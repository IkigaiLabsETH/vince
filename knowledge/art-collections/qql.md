# QQL

OpenSea Slug: `qql`

## The Artist

Tyler Hobbs (Fidenza) and Dandelion Mané. QQL is a collaborative generative project that reframes collectors as co-creators. The algorithm lives at qql.art; anyone can explore and generate “seeds.” You tweak traits across 12 categories—enough to steer, not fully control. Randomness stays in the mix. To mint an official QQL NFT you need a Mint Pass. 999 passes were created in September 2022; another 900 were sold via Dutch auction on Archipelago. Minting is open indefinitely—no expiry. New QQLs will appear for a long time.

## Why It Matters

QQL changed how people think about generative NFT minting. You’re not buying a random output; you’re curating. You generate, discard, iterate, then mint when you’re satisfied. The artist defines the system; the collector chooses the instance. That shift—from passive receiver to active selector—has influenced later projects. The Discord community pores over seeds, shares favourites, and develops shared taste. It’s collaborative in a real sense.

Hobbs’ name brings Fidenza-level credibility. QQL has held up as a canonical “collector-as-curator” experiment.

## The Art

Generative. Flowing, organic, often reminiscent of Fidenza’s flow fields but distinct. Colour, density, and composition vary by seed. The algorithm has range: sparse and minimal to dense and busy. Aesthetic standards have emerged from the community—certain seeds are widely agreed to be “hits.”

## Notable Pieces

Quality is seed-dependent. Pass holders mint what they consider best. Secondary market favours community-approved seeds and early mints. Passes themselves trade at a premium; they’re the bottleneck. Total QQL supply grows slowly over time.

## Context for Collectors

You need a Mint Pass to mint. Passes trade on OpenSea. Minting is permanent and open-ended. If you’re buying a minted QQL, you’re buying someone else’s curation. Check the seed, the community reception, and the pass structure before buying.

## Personal Take

QQL is one of the most important generative projects of the last few years. The curator model, the infinite mint window, and the community-driven taste-making all matter. Hobbs and Mané built something that rewards engagement, not just capital. If you’re into generative art, you should understand QQL even if you never hold a pass. Not overrated.
