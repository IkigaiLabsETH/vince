# Nouns

OpenSea Slug: `nouns`

## The Artist

Nouns DAO. The project was co-founded by “Nounders,” including Dom Hofmann (Vine) and Punk 4156, who sparked the idea on Twitter. One Noun, auctioned every 24 hours, forever. 32×32 pixel characters—people, places, things—generated from a shared palette. All artwork is CC0. Every Noun is a governance token: one Noun, one vote in the DAO. Proceeds from each auction go to the treasury. The system is trustless, on-chain, and deliberately minimal. No roadmap, no promised utility—just daily auctions and governance. That’s the product.

## Why It Matters

Nouns proved that “one per day, forever” could work as a sustainable model. The CC0 move meant anyone could use the art—derivatives, merch, games. The DAO funds everything from public goods to weird experiments. The project became a reference for “slow” NFT culture: no mint rush, no 10K drop, just a steady drip and a shared treasury. On-chain storage (not IPFS) and the Compound-style governance fork added technical credibility. For people who care about DAOs, CC0, and minimalist design, Nouns is foundational.

## The Art

32×32 pixels. Single solid background, one character. Glasses, hats, accessories—simple, bold, recognisable. The aesthetic is intentionally lo-fi. Each Noun is unique; the generator ensures no two are alike. You’re not buying resolution; you’re buying a slice of the Nouns universe and a vote.

## Notable Pieces

Supply grows by one per day. Early Nouns (low IDs) carry historical and governance premium. Rare traits and “vibes” also matter. Check nouns.wtf and OpenSea for auction and secondary activity. Treasury size and DAO activity affect narrative.

## Context for Collectors

You’re buying governance as much as art. One Noun = one vote. Auctions are daily; bidding is competitive. CC0 means the image is free to use—you own the token and the vote, not the copyright. If you’re in it for art only, understand that the value is heavily tied to the DAO and the meme.

## Personal Take

Nouns is one of the few NFT projects I’d call philosophically coherent. The daily auction, the CC0, the treasury, the lack of hype—it all fits. It’s not the flashiest art, but it’s a serious experiment in decentralised culture. Underrated by people who only care about floor and flip. Overrated by people who think it’ll replace everything. It’s neither—it’s its own thing. Worth understanding.
