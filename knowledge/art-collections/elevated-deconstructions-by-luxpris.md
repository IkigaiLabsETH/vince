# Elevated Deconstructions

OpenSea Slug: `elevated-deconstructions-by-luxpris`

## The Artist

luxpris. Elevated Deconstructions is an Art Blocks Curated project from 2020. It was **lot 6** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 works from Art Blocks founders. The title suggests deconstruction of form and elevation of structure; the output is algorithmically generated. Detailed artist bio is sparse, but inclusion in the foundational Sotheby’s lot marks it as part of early Art Blocks history.

## Why It Matters

Elevated Deconstructions sits in the same canonical set as Chromie Squiggle, Ringers, and Archetype. The Natively Digital sale was a turning point for generative NFTs; every project in that lot shares that legacy. It’s less discussed than the headline names but equally part of the story.

## The Art

Generative, structural. “Deconstructions” implies breaking down and reorganising form. The aesthetic is likely geometric or abstract. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for the full range and traits.

## Notable Pieces

Supply and structure are fixed (Art Blocks Curated). Check secondary for activity. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Important for Natively Digital completeness.

## Personal Take

Elevated Deconstructions is a supporting player in the 2021 moment—less famous, but historically part of the set. Underrated.
