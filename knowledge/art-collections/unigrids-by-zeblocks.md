# Unigrids

OpenSea Slug: `unigrids-by-zeblocks`

## The Artist

Zeblocks. Unigrids is an Art Blocks Curated project from 2020. It was **lot 11** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks. The name suggests unified or singular grids; the work is algorithmic and generative. Zeblocks’ broader practice is less documented, but the project’s place in the Natively Digital set is fixed.

## Why It Matters

Unigrids is part of the foundational Sotheby’s Art Blocks canon. The 19‑work sale helped legitimise generative art at auction. It’s less headline than Ringers or Fidenza but equally part of the historical record.

## The Art

Generative grids. Structure, density, and palette vary by seed. The aesthetic is likely geometric, systematic. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for traits and range.

## Notable Pieces

Art Blocks Curated. Supply fixed. Check secondary for activity. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Essential for Natively Digital coverage.

## Personal Take

Unigrids is an underrated piece of the 2021 moment. Worth knowing for collectors who care about the full set.
