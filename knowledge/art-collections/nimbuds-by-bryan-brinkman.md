# NimBuds

OpenSea Slug: `nimbuds-by-bryan-brinkman`

## The Artist

Bryan Brinkman. NimBuds dropped on Art Blocks Curated 16 January 2021: 400 pieces. Brinkman works in generative and digital art; NimBuds is one of his earlier Art Blocks releases. The project was **lot 9** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks. The name suggests growth or emergence (“buds”); the output is algorithmic.

## Why It Matters

NimBuds is part of the foundational Natively Digital cohort. The 19‑work sale helped establish generative NFTs in traditional auctions. It’s less famous than Fidenza or Ringers but equally part of that historical set.

## The Art

Generative. “Buds” implies organic, budding forms. Structure and palette vary by seed. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for traits and the full range.

## Notable Pieces

400 supply. Art Blocks Curated. Check secondary for activity. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Essential for Natively Digital coverage.

## Personal Take

NimBuds is an underrated piece of the 2021 moment. Worth knowing for the full Sotheby’s set.
