# Pak – Merge

OpenSea Slug: `pak-merge`

## The Artist

Pak is an anonymous digital artist and designer. Minimalist, conceptual, mechanism-obsessed. Merge dropped on Nifty Gateway in December 2021. The mechanic: buy “mass” during a 48-hour window at a fixed price. No cap. Each collector received a dynamic NFT that merged all their mass into a single token—the more mass, the larger the visual. Mass could be merged further on secondary. The result: 28,983 collectors, 312,686 units of mass, **$91.8M** in primary sales. The largest public art sale by a living artist, surpassing Jeff Koons’ “Rabbit” ($91.1M) and Beeple’s $69.3M NFT.

## Why It Matters

Merge redefined what an NFT “drop” could be. It wasn’t 10,000 fixed images—it was unlimited mass, consolidating over time. The mechanism rewarded accumulation and created built-in scarcity as larger holders merged. Pak turned the act of collecting into the artwork. The secondary market lets you add mass to your token, so the piece evolves. It’s conceptual, game-like, and ruthlessly elegant. The project proved that mechanism could drive scale and narrative as much as imagery. For anyone interested in “NFT as system,” Merge is essential.

## The Art

Dynamic. Your NFT is a visual representation of your mass—often minimalist, spherical or abstract. Size and form change as you merge. Pak’s aesthetic is stripped-down: shape, scale, logic. The “art” is the rule set and the collective behaviour, not a single static image.

## Notable Pieces

**Largest single mass** — Whoever holds the most merged mass has the “biggest” Merge. The leaderboard and the mechanic are the spectacle. Check Nifty Gateway and secondary platforms for structure. Mass tokens trade; merging is permanent.

## Context for Collectors

Merge lives on Nifty Gateway (and bridged variants). Understand the merge mechanic before buying—once you merge, you can’t unmerge. You’re buying into a system as much as an image. Liquidity and demand have shifted since launch; the project remains a reference for mechanism design.

## Personal Take

Merge is one of the sharpest NFT projects ever. Pak didn’t just make a pretty picture—they built a game, a market, and a collective artwork. The $91.8M figure is a fact; whether you “like” it is almost irrelevant. It’s a landmark. Not overrated. If you care about NFTs as systems, Merge belongs in the canon.
