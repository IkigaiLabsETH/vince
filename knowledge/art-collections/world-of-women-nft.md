# World of Women

OpenSea Slug: `world-of-women-nft`

## The Artist

Yam Karkai—artist and co-founder. WoW launched July 2021: 10,000 female avatars. Karkai drew 200 base women over two months; the rest were generated from trait combos. Co-founders include Raphaël Malavieille, BBA, and Toomaie. The project sold out overnight and became a blue-chip for representation—diverse skin tones, hairstyles, features. Christie’s, The New Yorker, Billboard featured it. Gary Vee, Logan Paul, and others collected. WoW later partnered with Universal Music; Guy Oseary came on. Royalties fund a WOW Fund for female artists. Special traits unlock clubs (royalties, investors, curators).

## Why It Matters

World of Women proved that “representation” could be a blue-chip thesis. The space was heavily male-coded; WoW made women the default. The art is polished, the mission explicit, and the partnerships real. It’s often cited as *the* female-led NFT success. The royalties model and the artist fund tied value to impact. For collectors who care about diversity, visibility, and mission-driven projects, WoW is foundational.

## The Art

Diverse female avatars. Up to 11 traits, 189 combos—skin tones, hair, face, eyes. The style is illustrative, warm, inclusive. Each character feels distinct. It’s PFP art with a clear message: women belong.

## Notable Pieces

10,000 supply. Rare traits unlock club access and can trade at a premium. Floor and volume have shifted with the market. Check OpenSea for structure. Celebrity holders and partnership news can move sentiment.

## Context for Collectors

You’re buying representation and community as much as the image. The WOW Fund and royalty clubs add utility. Verify you’re on the canonical collection. Liquidity is solid. This is “mission + PFP” as much as “art.”

## Personal Take

WoW earned its place. The art is strong; the mission matters. I’d rank it as essential for “representation in NFTs” and as a well-executed PFP project. Not overrated. Worth knowing.
