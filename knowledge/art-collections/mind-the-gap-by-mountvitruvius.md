# Mind the Gap

OpenSea Slug: `mind-the-gap-by-mountvitruvius`

## The Artist

MountVitruvius is a generative artist. Mind the Gap dropped on GmStudio in February 2022—999 pieces, 0.15 ETH mint. It’s inspired by childhood: play, exploration, a painting the artist made at age two (rediscovered and framed by family). The system uses only points, vectors, lines, and colour—no 3D, no shaders. The process: generate vector fields, scatter points (Poisson disc), advect them, iterate with collision checks, then render geometry. The goal was “pen-drawing” feel, joyful motion, vibrant colour, something childlike. He’s also done Renders Game, Trichro-matic, and other Art Blocks work.

## Why It Matters

Mind the Gap proved that generative art could be playful and technically crisp. The constraint—no 3D, no shaders—forces creativity into line and colour. The project has done thousands of ETH in volume and kept a strong holder base. It’s a reference point for “happy” generative art that doesn’t sacrifice rigor. MountVitruvius has talked about it on Art Blocks After Dinner Mints and elsewhere; the backstory (the childhood painting) adds narrative weight.

## The Art

Line-based, vector-driven. Flowing curves, bouncing forms, bright palettes. The outputs feel hand-drawn and energetic. Some are sparse; others denser. The “gap” in the title echoes the visual spaces between forms—negative space as part of the composition.

## Notable Pieces

999 supply. Floor has often sat around 0.15–0.2 ETH; total volume in the thousands of ETH. Certain colour schemes and compositions trade higher. High holder concentration; many don’t list. Check OpenSea and GmStudio for current activity.

## Context for Collectors

GmStudio launch; also on OpenSea. 999 fixed. If you like playful, line-driven generative art, Mind the Gap is a strong fit. MountVitruvius’ later work (e.g. Trichro-matic) is more complex; this one is intentionally simple and direct.

## Personal Take

Mind the Gap is one of those projects that’s easy to like. It’s warm, clear, and well executed. The childhood hook isn’t gimmicky—it shows in the outputs. Underrated next to flashier Art Blocks drops. Worth owning if you collect “feel-good” generative art.
