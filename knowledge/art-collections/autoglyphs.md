# Autoglyphs

OpenSea Slug: `autoglyphs`

## The Artist

Larva Labs again—Matt Hall and John Watkinson. After Punks, they asked a different question: what if the art wasn’t just *on* the blockchain but *created* there? No IPFS, no external render. The generator lives in the contract. When you mint, the Ethereum network runs the code and the output is the art. They launched it in April 2019. Each mint cost 0.2 ETH; every cent went to 350.org. All 512 sold out in four hours. The generator shut itself off permanently. That’s it. No more.

## Why It Matters

Autoglyphs are the first fully on-chain generative art. The algorithm is in the smart contract. The output exists as ASCII in the transaction data. You can’t point to a JPEG somewhere—the art *is* the execution. That distinction matters. It’s closer to Sol LeWitt’s instruction-based work than to most NFTs: the contract holds the instructions; the chain performs them. Museums get it. Centre Pompidou has one. The Whitney has #115. They’re studied as conceptual rigour as much as visual objects.

It also proved you could do generative art without Art Blocks. Larva Labs built the template—finite supply, sealed algorithm, collector-as-performer—that Art Blocks and everyone else riffed on. Autoglyphs didn’t just make pretty pictures; they defined a genre.

## The Art

ASCII-based patterns. The constraints were brutal: everything had to fit in a single Ethereum transaction, so the code had to be minimal. You get interference-like arrangements of a custom symbol set—simple at first glance, surprisingly varied. They read as abstract glyphs, somewhere between typography and plotter drawings. You can render them as images, print them with an AxiDraw, or just read the raw output from the chain. The aesthetic is “what can we do with almost no gas?”—and the answer is a lot.

## Notable Pieces

**Complete set of 10** – In February 2024, a full set of 10 Autoglyphs sold for 5,000 ETH (~$14.6M), one of the largest NFT sales in years. Fountain.xyz brokered it; the buyer was an anonymous traditional-art collector. Before that, a 10-piece set went for 731 ETH in early 2021.

**Autoglyph #115** – In the Whitney’s permanent collection, acquired 2024.

**Autoglyph #25** – In the Centre Pompidou, featured in their NFT exhibition.

Individual Glyphs don’t have the same headline sales as Punks, but the set sales and museum placements tell you how the serious art world views them.

## Context for Collectors

Only 512 exist. The generator is dead. Supply is fixed forever. Floor is typically well above most generative art; you’re buying into a tiny, canonical set.

People collect single Glyphs or small sets. The “full set” market is its own thing—whale territory. Condition doesn’t apply; they’re on-chain. Provenance is the blockchain. No surprises, no rediscovered troves.

Larva Labs eventually moved Punks to Yuga; Autoglyphs stayed with Larva and feel more “pure” to a lot of collectors. Less brand, more concept.

## Personal Take

From a pure art perspective, Autoglyphs are Larva Labs’ best work. Punks are the cultural landmark; Autoglyphs are the *idea* landmark. The art-is-the-algorithm framing, the charity mint, the hard cap, the museum adoption—it all holds up. They’re not the flashiest things to look at, but they’re among the most defensible “why does this matter?” pieces in NFTs.

If you care about generative art as a form, not just as collectibles, Autoglyphs belong in the conversation. They’re underrated by normies and overrated by almost nobody. Still expensive. Probably worth it.
