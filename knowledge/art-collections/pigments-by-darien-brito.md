# Pigments

OpenSea Slug: `pigments-by-darien-brito`

## The Artist

Darien Brito—Ecuadorian audiovisual artist and creative coder, based in The Hague. Pigments dropped 6 August 2021, Art Blocks Curated: 1,024 pieces. GLSL/WebGL. The project is a study in _colour_. The algorithm distorts the canvas—warping, altering—before “pigment” is applied; structures emerge from noise and randomness. The result evokes natural substances, minerals, organic growth. Brito offers prints (paper, sublimated metal) for holders. The work sits between abstraction and nature.

## Why It Matters

Pigments proved that generative art could make colour the subject. The distortion-first approach creates depth and variation. Brito’s command of GLSL shows. The project is a reference for colour-focused, abstract generative art on Art Blocks. For collectors who care about palette and texture, Pigments belongs on the list.

## The Art

Generative colour fields. Evocative abstraction—mineral, organic, layered. Palette and structure vary by seed. The look is rich, often soft. Check the Art Blocks project and darienbrito.com for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

1,024 supply. Certain palettes and compositions trade higher. Brito’s name and the print option support demand. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. 1,024 fixed. Prints are available; confirm current terms. If you like colour-driven generative work, Pigments is a strong fit.

## Personal Take

Pigments is a solid, focused project. The colour research reads. Underrated next to flashier Curated drops. Worth a look.
