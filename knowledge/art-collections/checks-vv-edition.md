# Checks (VV Edition)

OpenSea Slug: `checks-vv-edition`

## The Artist

Jack Butcher again—Visualize Value, Opepen, Checks. Checks launched 3 January 2023: 80 Twitter-style verification checkmarks on black, open edition, 24-hour mint. $8 each—same as Twitter Blue. The project was commentary on Elon’s paid verification: identity, status, “authenticity” as product. 16,027 NFTs sold. Floor jumped to ~0.24 ETH; some moved at 4–8 ETH. ~$4.7M secondary. Butcher added a burn mechanism (à la Damien Hirst): burn the NFT, receive a physical print. Checks became a moment— woke the community from a sleepy winter, per CoinDesk.

## Why It Matters

Checks proved that a single gesture—80 checkmarks—could carry concept, meme, and market. Butcher turned verification into satire and collectible. The burn-for-print mechanic added a layer. The project sits alongside Opepen as “Jack Butcher as system designer.” For anyone tracking conceptual NFT art and critique-of-platform culture, Checks is essential. The “checks-vv-edition” slug typically denotes the Visualize Value / open edition drop.

## The Art

80 checks on black. Colour and arrangement vary by token. Minimal, graphic, instantly readable. The “art” is the idea: verification as aesthetic object.

## Notable Pieces

Open edition, so supply is fixed at mint count. Rarity is perceptual—certain colour combos and “vibes” trade higher. Check OpenSea and Butcher’s channels for structure. The burn option affects circulating supply over time.

## Context for Collectors

Understand the burn mechanic before buying. You’re buying concept and Butcher’s name as much as image. Verify you’re on the VV edition contract. Liquidity has varied with sentiment.

## Personal Take

Checks is Butcher at his most direct. The commentary landed; the market responded. Not overrated. Essential for “concept as collectible” and platform critique.
