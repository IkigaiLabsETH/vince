# The Cameras

OpenSea Slug: `0xdgb-thecameras`

## The Artist

0xdgb is an anonymous digital artist who came onto the scene relatively recently but has built a real following. His work is minimalist, informed by architecture, photography, and influences like Hiroshi Nagai and Ed Ruscha. The Cameras dropped in August 2023—70 pieces on Ethereum. He’s been careful about community and consistency rather than hype, and it shows in holder concentration and collector support.

## Why It Matters

The Cameras turn surveillance hardware into a motif. Each piece is a camera—CCTV, dome, bullet—rendered in a clean, graphic style. 0xdgb leaves the reading open: they can stand for constant digital surveillance or for the transparency of the blockchain. You choose. The collection also has a novel mechanic: holders could interact with the contract to choose and lock which camera design their NFT displays before metadata froze. So you’re not just buying an image; you’re making a curatorial choice. That small gesture makes it stick.

## The Art

Minimalist, often geometric. Surveillance cameras as subject—different series, palettes, and named variants. Traits include Series, Color Palette, Camera Name, and a “Collector’s Choice” attribute. The look is polished and intentional, more design than noise. Easy to read as a set.

## Notable Pieces

70 items total. Floor has often sat around 0.05 ETH; total volume in the tens of ETH. The “Collector’s Choice” mechanic and the tight supply mean that specific palettes or series can trade at a premium. It’s a focused, owner-heavy collection rather than a flip-heavy one.

## Context for Collectors

70 supply, fixed. Metadata freeze means your selection is permanent. Check that you actually like the trait combo you lock in. The project is early in 0xdgb’s arc—if you’re betting on the artist, you’re buying into what comes next as much as this set.

## Personal Take

The Cameras are a sharp, conceptual take on surveillance and transparency without being preachy. The selector mechanic is a nice touch—it gives owners a real decision. 0xdgb feels like someone building a body of work rather than chasing a drop. If you like minimal, concept-driven NFT art, this one’s worth a look. Not a blue chip yet, but it has a clear identity.
