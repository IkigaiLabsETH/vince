# Spectron

OpenSea Slug: `spectron-by-simon-de-mai`

## The Artist

Simon De Mai. Spectron is an Art Blocks Curated project from 2020. It was **lot 13** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks, between Ringers and 27-Bit Digital. The name suggests spectrum, light, or range; the output is algorithmic and generative. De Mai’s other work and bio are less documented, but his place in the Natively Digital set is established.

## Why It Matters

Spectron belongs to the canonical Natively Digital cohort. That sale marked generative art’s entry into major auctions. Every project in the 19‑work lot shares that legacy. It’s less famous than Ringers or Archetype but historically part of the same moment.

## The Art

Generative. “Spectron” implies spectral or colour-range-driven structure. Aesthetic and traits vary by seed. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

Art Blocks Curated. Supply fixed. Check secondary for activity. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Important for Natively Digital completeness.

## Personal Take

Spectron is an underrated entry in the 2021 set. Worth knowing for the full Sotheby’s story.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs
