# Dynamic Slices

OpenSea Slug: `dynamic-slices-by-pxlq`

## The Artist

pxlq. Dynamic Slices dropped on Art Blocks Curated in 2020: 512 iterations, long-form generative. The work features **interactive animation**—slices, motion, algorithm-driven behaviour. Pieces from the collection have appeared at Sotheby’s (e.g. Dynamic Slices #44, Digital Art Day Auction 2024). The project was **lot 5** in the 2021 Natively Digital sale (19 Art Blocks).

## Why It Matters

Dynamic Slices was part of the foundational Sotheby’s Art Blocks moment. It also proved that **animated**, interactive outputs could sit in Curated—not just static images. The combination of structure and motion made it a reference for “generative art as performance.” Collectors who care about early Art Blocks and animation-heavy work should know it.

## The Art

Generative slices, often animated. The algorithm produces geometry and movement; each token has its own behaviour. The look is clean, systematic, sometimes minimal. Check Art Blocks for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

512 supply. Certain configurations and animations trade higher. Dynamic Slices #44 has been to Sotheby’s. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Animated/interactive—display matters. Verify project and contract. Essential for Natively Digital and animation-in-generative-art history.

## Personal Take

Dynamic Slices is an underrated bridge between static Curated work and later animated projects. Solid pick for collectors who like motion.

> **📌 Knowledge Base Note**
> 
> This essay contains **historical examples and illustrative data** from when it was written.
> - **Numbers, prices, and metrics are OUTDATED** - they illustrate concepts, not current conditions
> - **Focus: Methodology and frameworks** - learn HOW TO THINK about topics, not what the numbers were
> - **Use for:** Analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic thinking
> - **Do NOT use for:** Current prices, up-to-date metrics, real-time data
> 
> **What this provides:** Thinking frameworks, methodologies, analytical approaches
> **What this does NOT provide:** Current market data (use actions/APIs instead)

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs
