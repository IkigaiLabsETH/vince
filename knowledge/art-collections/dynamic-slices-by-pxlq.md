# Dynamic Slices

OpenSea Slug: `dynamic-slices-by-pxlq`

## The Artist

pxlq. Dynamic Slices dropped on Art Blocks Curated in 2020: 512 iterations, long-form generative. The work features **interactive animation**—slices, motion, algorithm-driven behaviour. Pieces from the collection have appeared at Sotheby’s (e.g. Dynamic Slices #44, Digital Art Day Auction 2024). The project was **lot 5** in the 2021 Natively Digital sale (19 Art Blocks).

## Why It Matters

Dynamic Slices was part of the foundational Sotheby’s Art Blocks moment. It also proved that **animated**, interactive outputs could sit in Curated—not just static images. The combination of structure and motion made it a reference for “generative art as performance.” Collectors who care about early Art Blocks and animation-heavy work should know it.

## The Art

Generative slices, often animated. The algorithm produces geometry and movement; each token has its own behaviour. The look is clean, systematic, sometimes minimal. Check Art Blocks for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

512 supply. Certain configurations and animations trade higher. Dynamic Slices #44 has been to Sotheby’s. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Animated/interactive—display matters. Verify project and contract. Essential for Natively Digital and animation-in-generative-art history.

## Personal Take

Dynamic Slices is an underrated bridge between static Curated work and later animated projects. Solid pick for collectors who like motion.
