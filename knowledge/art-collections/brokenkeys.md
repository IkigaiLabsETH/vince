# Broken Keys

OpenSea Slug: `brokenkeys`

## The Artist

Alpha Centauri Kid (ACK) again. Broken Keys is a 1/1 generative collection centred on the piano. ACK has called it his “first gateway to the Muse”—each key as a way to open the mind to new ideas. The project took about a year and a half to develop; he documented much of it in a long series of tweets from December 2021 through the May 2023 launch. Each piece ties to specific experiences and emotions from 2021–2023. It’s personal, not just procedural.

## Why It Matters

Broken Keys is generative art with a clear emotional and autobiographical layer. The piano isn’t a random motif; it’s the throughline. The 1/1 format means every output is unique and hand-picked into the set. ACK’s storytelling around the project—the tweet thread, the “broken keys” metaphor—gives it narrative weight. It’s also a contrast to The Great Color Study: same artist, different mode (colour system vs. intimate, instrument-based work).

## The Art

Piano-focused. Keys, fragments, abstraction around the instrument. The style is generative but often feels melancholic or introspective. Pieces vary in density and palette. Royalties (e.g. 7.5%) apply. At least 44 distinct works are documented; the full set lives on OpenSea as 1/1s.

## Notable Pieces

1/1s, so each piece stands alone. Secondary activity and prices depend on composition, story, and collector demand. ACK’s following and the project’s narrative help support value.

## Context for Collectors

All 1/1. You’re buying a single work, not a trait in a large set. Check the artist’s notes and the tweet chronology if you care about context. This is a “collect the artist and the story” play.

## Personal Take

Broken Keys is ACK at his most personal. The piano hook and the build-up of documentation make it memorable. If you like generative art that carries explicit emotion and narrative, it’s a strong fit. Less “system showcase,” more “diary in algorithm.”
