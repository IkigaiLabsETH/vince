# Justin Aversano – Twin Flames

## The Artist

Justin Aversano (b. 1992)—multidisciplinary artist, portrait photographer. Twin Flames is 100 photographs of twins from around the world, shot between May 2017 and July 2018. Peru, New York, California, London. The project began after his fraternal twin died; he’s called it “a healing journey through art to build connections and find peace.” The work explores twindom—shared identity, biology, experience across cultures. He used Polaroid, 120mm, and 4×5. It debuted as a photobook and gallery show in 2019, then minted as NFTs in February 2021 (Valentine’s Day) after connecting with CryptoPunks-era collectors. Sold out within days. We also have a separate knowledge file for his Gabba Gallery work; Twin Flames is the flagship 100-piece set.

## Why It Matters

Twin Flames helped put photography on the NFT map. It was one of the earliest serious photo projects to sell out and trade at scale. #83 went for $1.1M at Christie’s in October 2021. The collection has done thousands of ETH in volume. Aversano proved that traditional photography—twin portraits, film, narrative—could hold its own in a space dominated by PFPs and generative art. The personal backstory and the rigor of the project gave it weight. For collectors who care about photography NFTs, Twin Flames is foundational.

## The Art

Portrait photography. One twin pair per image. Film-based—Polaroid, medium format, large format. The aesthetic is intentional, intimate, documentary. Each NFT ties to a specific pair, with names and context. The look is fine-art photography: considered, symbolic, sometimes mystical.

## Notable Pieces

**Twin Flames #83** — $1.1M at Christie’s, October 2021. The canonical sale.

**Full set** — 100 pieces. Floor and volume have held; the collection is liquid for photo NFTs. Certain pairs and compositions trade at a premium.

## Context for Collectors

100 supply, fixed. Verify you’re buying the Twin Flames collection (e.g. twinflames on OpenSea; plugin uses justin-aversano-twin-flames). Photography NFT liquidity is thinner than PFP; you’re buying the image and the story. Aversano’s broader practice (Smoke & Mirrors, etc.) extends the narrative.

## Personal Take

Twin Flames earned its place. Aversano didn’t slap photos on-chain—he built a body of work and then adapted it. The Christie’s sale and the volume reflect real demand. From a pure art perspective, it’s one of the most important photography NFT projects. Not overrated. If you collect photo NFTs, Twin Flames is essential.
