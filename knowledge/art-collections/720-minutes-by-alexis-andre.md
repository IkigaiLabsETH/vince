# 720 Minutes

OpenSea Slug: `720-minutes-by-alexis-andre`

## The Artist

Alexis André—French artist and researcher based in Tokyo. His work centres on generative and interactive art, often in Processing. He’s collaborated with ISSEY MIYAKE and Jean-Michel Jarre and built the generative music/visual app “EoN.” 720 Minutes is an Art Blocks Curated project: **720 unique variations**, one per minute over twelve hours. It functions as a real-time clock; each NFT “activates” on its minute, looping every twelve hours. The project was **lot 16** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks.

## Why It Matters

720 Minutes is part of the foundational Natively Digital set. It also proved that **temporal**, clock-based generative art could sit in Curated. The “one minute, one variation” idea is clear and memorable. André’s reputation (ISSEY MIYAKE, EoN) adds weight. For collectors who care about time-based and conceptual generative work, 720 Minutes is a reference.

## The Art

Generative. Real-time, clock-driven. Traits include Brightness, Colors, Energy, Fill, Movement, Palette, Shape, Size. The piece changes with the minute; display and behaviour matter.

## Notable Pieces

720 supply. Art Blocks Curated. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks for structure. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19. Display as intended—running continuously—to get the full effect.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Temporal work: consider how you’ll display it. Verify project and contract. Essential for Natively Digital and time-based generative art.

## Personal Take

720 Minutes is a strong conceptual project. The clock mechanic isn’t a gimmick—it’s structural. Underrated. Worth a close look.

> - **Use for:** Analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic thinking
> - **Do NOT use for:** Current prices, up-to-date metrics, real-time data
> 
> **What this provides:** Thinking frameworks, methodologies, analytical approaches
> **What this does NOT provide:** Current market data (use actions/APIs instead)

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs
