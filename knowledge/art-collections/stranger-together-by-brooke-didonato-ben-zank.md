# Stranger Together

OpenSea Slug: `stranger-together-by-brooke-didonato-ben-zank`

## The Artist

Brooke DiDonato and Ben Zank are both photographers known for surreal, staged imagery. “Stranger Together” is a joint NFT collection on Foundation—20 pieces, 18 owners. The title suggests connection and alienation at once. Their individual work often plays with identity, isolation, and odd juxtapositions; a collaboration likely amplifies those themes. DiDonato has been profiled by HENI and others; Zank’s work circulates in art and photo circles. The collection has done 61+ ETH in volume with a floor around 0.59 ETH.

## Why It Matters

Stranger Together is a focused, two-artist collaboration. Small supply (20) and established names create scarcity and collector interest. The “stranger together” idea—proximity and distance—fits a moment of fractured connection. For collectors who like surreal, conceptual photography NFTs, it’s a clear fit. The volume suggests real demand.

## The Art

Photography. Surreal, staged. Expect the uncanny, the displaced, the quietly absurd—consistent with both artists’ solo work. Precise compositions, often single-figure or small-group. Check Foundation and artist sites for the full set.

## Notable Pieces

20 supply. Secondary activity on Foundation. Floor and sales reflect the small edition and dual-artist draw. Check current listings for availability.

## Context for Collectors

Foundation, Ethereum. 20 pieces only. You’re buying collaborative work from two recognised artists. Liquidity is limited; it’s a holder’s collection.

## Personal Take

Stranger Together is a strong collaboration. Both artists have distinct voices; the joint frame adds focus. If you like surreal photo NFTs, it’s worth knowing. Not overrated.
