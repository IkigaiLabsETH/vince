# Singularity

OpenSea Slug: `singularity-by-hideki-tsukamoto`

## The Artist

Hideki Tsukamoto. Singularity dropped on Art Blocks Curated 1 January 2021: 1,024 pieces. It was **lot 7** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks. The title suggests a point of convergence or transformation; the work is algorithmic and generative. Tsukamoto’s broader practice and other projects are less documented, but his place in the Natively Digital set is fixed.

## Why It Matters

Singularity is part of the foundational Sotheby’s Art Blocks canon. The 19‑work lot legitimised generative art at auction; every project in it shares that importance. It’s less headline than Ringers or Fidenza but equally part of the historical record.

## The Art

Generative. The “singularity” concept likely informs structure—convergence, focus, or emergence. Aesthetic and traits vary by seed. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

1,024 supply. Art Blocks Curated. Check secondary for activity. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Essential for Natively Digital coverage.

## Personal Take

Singularity is an underrated entry in the 2021 cohort. Worth knowing for collectors who care about the full set.
