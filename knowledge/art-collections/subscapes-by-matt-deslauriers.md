# Subscapes

OpenSea Slug: `subscapes-by-matt-deslauriers`

## The Artist

Matt DesLauriers again. Subscapes hit Art Blocks 23 April 2021: 650 pieces. ~17KB of minified JavaScript. The algorithm combines 3D projection, parametric geometry, simplex noise, quadtrees, flow fields, raycasting, diffuse lighting, procedural colour. Outputs are polylines tied to the token hash; you can render to canvas or export as JSON for plotters, CNC. Eleven trait categories, 51 attributes—Style (e.g. Acrylic, Pencil), Palette, Brushed, etc. Source is MIT on GitHub. We have Meridian; Subscapes is the geometric, submarine-landscape precursor.

## Why It Matters

Subscapes showed that generative art could be technically dense and still collectible. The open-source angle and the plotter/CNC export made it a favourite among creative coders. DesLauriers’ reputation carried it. The 650 supply and the trait variety created a clear market. For collectors who like geometric, systematic work, Subscapes is a key Art Blocks project.

## The Art

Generative landscapes. Submarine, geometric, stratified. Styles range from “acrylic” to “pencil”; palettes and rendering modes vary. The look is precise, structural, often minimal. Check the Art Blocks project and GitHub for behaviour.

## Notable Pieces

650 supply. Rare styles and palettes command premiums. DesLauriers’ name supports demand. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. 650 fixed. If you collect DesLauriers, Subscapes is essential. Verify project and contract.

## Personal Take

Subscapes is DesLauriers at his most technical. The open source and the export options add value. Not as widely discussed as Meridian, but solid. Underrated.

> **📌 Knowledge Base Note**
> 
> This essay contains **historical examples and illustrative data** from when it was written.
> - **Numbers, prices, and metrics are OUTDATED** - they illustrate concepts, not current conditions
> - **Focus: Methodology and frameworks** - learn HOW TO THINK about topics, not what the numbers were
> - **Use for:** Analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic thinking
> - **Do NOT use for:** Current prices, up-to-date metrics, real-time data
> 
> **What this provides:** Thinking frameworks, methodologies, analytical approaches
> **What this does NOT provide:** Current market data (use actions/APIs instead)

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs
