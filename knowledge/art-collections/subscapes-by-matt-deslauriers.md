# Subscapes

OpenSea Slug: `subscapes-by-matt-deslauriers`

## The Artist

Matt DesLauriers again. Subscapes hit Art Blocks 23 April 2021: 650 pieces. ~17KB of minified JavaScript. The algorithm combines 3D projection, parametric geometry, simplex noise, quadtrees, flow fields, raycasting, diffuse lighting, procedural colour. Outputs are polylines tied to the token hash; you can render to canvas or export as JSON for plotters, CNC. Eleven trait categories, 51 attributes—Style (e.g. Acrylic, Pencil), Palette, Brushed, etc. Source is MIT on GitHub. We have Meridian; Subscapes is the geometric, submarine-landscape precursor.

## Why It Matters

Subscapes showed that generative art could be technically dense and still collectible. The open-source angle and the plotter/CNC export made it a favourite among creative coders. DesLauriers’ reputation carried it. The 650 supply and the trait variety created a clear market. For collectors who like geometric, systematic work, Subscapes is a key Art Blocks project.

## The Art

Generative landscapes. Submarine, geometric, stratified. Styles range from “acrylic” to “pencil”; palettes and rendering modes vary. The look is precise, structural, often minimal. Check the Art Blocks project and GitHub for behaviour.

## Notable Pieces

650 supply. Rare styles and palettes command premiums. DesLauriers’ name supports demand. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. 650 fixed. If you collect DesLauriers, Subscapes is essential. Verify project and contract.

## Personal Take

Subscapes is DesLauriers at his most technical. The open source and the export options add value. Not as widely discussed as Meridian, but solid. Underrated.
