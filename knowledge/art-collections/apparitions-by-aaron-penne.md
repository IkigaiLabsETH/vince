OpenSea Slug: `apparitions-by-aaron-penne`

## The Artist

Aaron Penne. Apparitions is an Art Blocks Curated project exploring “the space between algorithmic and organic.” Each piece is unique to the transaction that created it. Traits include Altitude (Stratosphere, Troposphere), Backdrop, Colors (e.g. Riley, Basil Gogos), Facing, Positioning, Haunting (Premonition, Persistent, Calm, Don’t Panic), Reach, Spook, Stretch. The project was **lot 17** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks.

## Why It Matters

Apparitions is part of the canonical Natively Digital set. The “algorithmic vs. organic” framing and the trait names give it a distinct conceptual edge. Penne’s work has held attention; the collection often trades in the 0.1–0.45 ETH range. For collectors who care about Natively Digital and conceptual generative art, Apparitions is essential.

## The Art

Generative. Organic-algorithmic hybrid. Atmosphere, colour, and “haunting” traits shape the mood. The look ranges from calm to unsettling. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

1,000+ supply. Certain trait combos command premiums. Floor has often sat around 0.11–0.45 ETH. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Important for Natively Digital and conceptually driven generative art.

## Personal Take

Apparitions is a thoughtful, underrated entry in the 2021 set. The conceptual hook works. Worth a look.
