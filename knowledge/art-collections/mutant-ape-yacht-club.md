# Mutant Ape Yacht Club

OpenSea Slug: `mutant-ape-yacht-club`

## The Artist

Yuga Labs again. Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) launched August 2021 as a companion to BAYC. Holders received a Mutant Serum airdrop; using it “mutated” your Bored Ape into a Mutant. Everyone else could mint a Mutant Ape for a fee. 20,000 Mutants total—mutation-based plus direct mints. The aesthetic is deliberately rougher: deformed, irradiated, sometimes grotesque. Same universe, different vibe. MAYC extended the Yacht Club ecosystem and gave non-holders an entry point.

## Why It Matters

MAYC proved that airdrop + paid-mint companions could scale. BAYC holders got Serums; Mutants became the “second tier” of the club. The mutation mechanic tied value back to the original apes—you needed one to create a Mutant from it—while also allowing new buyers in. Culturally, MAYC captured the “weirder” side of the brand. It’s less “cool flex” than BAYC, more “mutant degenerate.” The collection did huge volume and became a blue-chip companion. You can’t tell the Yuga story without MAYC.

## The Art

Mutant apes. Distorted bodies, extra limbs, glowing elements, decay. Trait structure similar to BAYC but with a horror/sci-fi tilt. Some are cute-mutant; others are full nightmare. Rarity and desirability vary. The style is consistent with the Yacht Club but intentionally off.

## Notable Pieces

20,000 supply. Mutants created from rare BAYC + rare Serum (M1, M2, Mega) command premiums. Floor has typically sat below BAYC but with meaningful volume. Check OpenSea for current structure. MAYC holders get club benefits analogous to BAYC.

## Context for Collectors

MAYC is a BAYC companion. You don’t need a Bored Ape to hold a Mutant, but the mutation mechanic links them. IP and ecosystem (Otherside, ApeCoin) align with Yuga. Liquidity is strong. You’re buying into the same universe as BAYC, at a different tier.

## Personal Take

MAYC is BAYC’s shadow—less mainstream, more niche. The airdrop model was smart; the aesthetic resonated with a different slice of holders. I’d rank it as “essential if you care about Yuga” but not as culturally defining as BAYC. Not overrated. Solid companion play.
