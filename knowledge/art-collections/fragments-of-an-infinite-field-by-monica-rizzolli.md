# Fragments of an Infinite Field

OpenSea Slug: `fragments-of-an-infinite-field-by-monica-rizzolli`

## The Artist

Monica Rizzolli is a Brazilian artist—painter first, then creative coding (2012). She’s been making generative work since 2015. Fragments dropped 13 September 2021, Art Blocks Curated Series 4: 1,024 pieces. The system generates an idealised plant species in a potentially infinite field. Season drives the environment—summer rain, winter snow, autumn petals, spring pollen. Macro variables (e.g. petal count) and micro mutations create variation. Figure and background blur; chromatic masses dominate. Built with p5.js; CC BY license.

## Why It Matters

Fragments proved that generative art could do “botanical” without being literal. The morphogenesis—organism-like growth, procedural structure—feels alive. Rizzolli’s painterly background shows. The project is a reference for nature-inspired generative art on Art Blocks. For collectors who care about organic systems, colour, and subtle variation, Fragments belongs on the list.

## The Art

Generative plants. Flowers, foliage, seasonal phenomena. Palette and density shift with parameters. The aesthetic is lush, abstract, often soft. Outputs range from spare to dense. Check the Art Blocks project for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

1,024 supply. Certain seasons and compositions trade higher. Rizzolli’s name and the Curated status support demand. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. 1,024 fixed. If you like botanical or organic generative art, Fragments is a strong fit. Verify project and contract.

## Personal Take

Fragments is a thoughtful, cohesive project. The seasonal logic and the morphogenesis give it structure. Underrated in “greatest Art Blocks” discussions. Worth a look.
