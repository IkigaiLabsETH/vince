# Getijde

OpenSea Slug: `getijde-by-bart-simons`

## The Artist

Bart Simons is a generative artist. “Getijde” is Dutch for “tide”—the rise and fall of the sea. The project leans into that: rhythm, cycle, water, repetition. Simons’ work often explores natural systems and algorithmic translation of environmental patterns. Getijde fits that lane—generative art that takes tidal logic as a starting point rather than pure abstraction.

## Why It Matters

Getijde is a niche but coherent generative project. The tidal metaphor gives it a clear concept: change, periodicity, ebb and flow. For collectors who like nature-inspired or systems-based generative art, it’s a distinct flavour. It hasn’t had the same auction or volume arc as Fidenza or Ringers, but it has a dedicated following. The name and concept stick.

## The Art

Generative. Likely rhythm- and wave-like—structure that echoes tides rather than literal seascapes. Palette and density probably vary by seed. For precise outputs, check the project page and secondary examples. The aesthetic tends toward organic, systematic, and minimal.

## Notable Pieces

Supply and structure depend on the release (Art Blocks, FX(hash), or standalone). Check OpenSea and project docs for edition sizes and secondary activity. Certain seeds and “phase” moments in the cycle may command premiums among collectors who care about the metaphor.

## Context for Collectors

Verify platform (Art Blocks vs elsewhere) and contract. If you’re into tidal cycles, natural systems, or under-the-radar generative work, Getijde is worth a look. It’s more “collector favourite” than “headline project.”

## Personal Take

Getijde is a thoughtful, concept-driven project. The tide hook isn’t superficial—it shapes how you look at the outputs. Not the most high-profile generative set, but solid for anyone building a “nature + algorithm” corner of a collection. Underrated.

> This essay contains **historical examples and illustrative data** from when it was written.
> - **Numbers, prices, and metrics are OUTDATED** - they illustrate concepts, not current conditions
> - **Focus: Methodology and frameworks** - learn HOW TO THINK about topics, not what the numbers were
> - **Use for:** Analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic thinking
> - **Do NOT use for:** Current prices, up-to-date metrics, real-time data

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs
