# Cool Cats

OpenSea Slug: `cool-cats-nft`

## The Artist

Cool Cats LLC. Colin Egan (The Catoonist) created “Blue Cat” a decade before the drop; the NFT collection repurposed him. Tom Williamson (blockchain), Rob Mehew (dev), Evan Luza (creative) rounded out the team. Launched 1 July 2021: 9,999 algorithmically generated cats. Mint started at 0.06 ETH, dropped to 0.02 during early struggle—then took off. Cool Cats hit #3 on OpenSea behind Punks and BAYC. Mike Tyson, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Aoki, Puma held. The project offered utility via events, claims, raffles. It’s an early PFP success that didn’t rely on apes or punks.

## Why It Matters

Cool Cats proved that a single strong character (Blue) could anchor a 10k PFP project. The cats are approachable, meme-friendly, and distinct. The team shipped utility and community; the brand held through the bear. It’s often cited as a “ OG” PFP alongside BAYC and Punks—smaller but persistent. For collectors who care about 2021 PFP culture and “vibes” projects, Cool Cats is a reference.

## The Art

Cartoon cats. Rounded, cute, trait-driven. 300k+ possible combos—bodies, faces, hats, glasses, clothes. Rarity tiers: “cool,” “wild,” “classy,” “exotic.” The aesthetic is cohesive and shareable. It’s PFP first, gallery second.

## Notable Pieces

9,999 supply. Rare and “exotic” traits command premiums. Floor and volume have fluctuated. Check OpenSea for structure. Celebrity holders and Cool Cats–brand updates can affect demand.

## Context for Collectors

You’re buying into the Cool Cats brand and community. Verify you’re on the flagship collection. Liquidity is moderate. This is “early PFP + character” as much as “art.”

## Personal Take

Cool Cats is a solid early PFP. The character works; the team executed. It’s less culturally dominant than BAYC but more than a footnote. Not overrated. Worth knowing for 2021 NFT history.
