# The Great Color Study

OpenSea Slug: `ackcolorstudy`

## The Artist

AlphaCentauriKid (ACK) is a generative artist with a strong focus on colour and system. The Great Color Study landed in October 2022—2,801 pieces across 10 named colour variants: Stardust, Asphalt, Pollen, Dark Red Death, Blue, Algae, Electric Gray, Coral, Brick, Royalty. Each variant explores a tight palette; the algorithm varies layout, rows, columns, and colour modulation. ACK is also behind Broken Keys and has a visible process (e.g. long tweet threads). The work sits between strict abstraction and something almost musical.

## Why It Matters

The Great Color Study is a colour-first project. No narrative, no figs—just hue, saturation, and arrangement. The 10 variants give collectors clear buckets: you can chase a favourite name or hunt for specific layout/colour combos. It’s done solid volume (hundreds of ETH) and has a broad holder base. For anyone who thinks generative art is “random,” ACK’s work is a counter: deliberate structure, clear constraints.

There’s a separate “Color Study” by Jeff Davis on Art Blocks Presents; that’s a different project. ACK’s lives on OpenSea as ackcolorstudy. Don’t confuse them.

## The Art

Geometric colour fields. Grids, bands, blocks. The 10 variants lock in palettes; the algorithm varies composition within each. Outputs range from minimal and sparse to busier, more layered. The vibe is clean and graphic—design-forward rather than painterly.

## Notable Pieces

2,801 supply. Floor has often been around 0.1–0.2 ETH; total volume in the hundreds of ETH. Certain variants (e.g. Dark Red Death, Royalty) and strong layouts trade at a premium. It’s a high-supply project, so liquidity is decent but individual pieces need to stand out.

## Context for Collectors

High supply, multiple variants. If you’re buying for colour or variant preference, check a few outputs first. ACK has a devoted following; the project rewards people who like his system. Creator fees (e.g. 10%) apply on secondary.

## Personal Take

The Great Color Study is a solid “colour as subject” project. ACK commits to the constraint and the variants give it shape. It’s not as headline as Fidenza or Ringers, but it’s coherent and collectible. Good pick if you want generative art that’s explicitly about palette and structure.
