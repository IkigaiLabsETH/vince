# Lifeguard Towers: Miami

OpenSea Slug: `lifeguard-towers-miami`

## The Artist

Tommy Kwak is a photographer. “Lifeguard Towers: Miami” documents Miami Beach’s iconic towers—redesigned in vibrant “tropical deco” after Hurricane Andrew (1992) to uplift the community. Architect William Lane led the design. Kwak’s approach is methodical: consistent framing, long exposures, minimal sky and sea, so each tower’s colour and character stand out. The series has won Prix de la Photographie (Architecture Photographer of the Year), FAPA Bronze, and ND Awards Bronze. He also published a hardcover (Blurring Books, 42 photographs, intro by *The New Yorker*’s Karen Taylor Quinn); it’s in its fourth printing. The NFT set lives on Foundation—28 pieces, 16 owners.

## Why It Matters

Lifeguard Towers: Miami is documentary photography with a clear subject and story. The towers are public infrastructure, community symbols, and design objects. Kwak’s consistency and the award recognition give it credibility. The NFT collection is tight (28); the book extends the project into physical form. For collectors who care about architecture, place, or documentary photo NFTs, it’s a strong pick. Floor has often been around 0.15 ETH; individual auctions can reach 1 ETH or more.

## The Art

Photography. Miami Beach lifeguard towers—bright, distinct, tropical deco. Uniform framing and long exposure keep the focus on form and colour. Each image is a single tower, carefully composed.

## Notable Pieces

28 NFTs on Foundation. Secondary activity and auctions determine prices. The book and awards add context. Check Foundation and the artist’s site for current listings.

## Context for Collectors

Foundation, Ethereum. Small supply. You’re buying the photograph and the project. Liquidity is limited; it’s a collector’s piece. The book is separate but part of the same body of work.

## Personal Take

Lifeguard Towers: Miami is a tight, well-executed documentary project. The towers are inherently photogenic; Kwak does them justice. If you like architecture or place-based photography NFTs, it’s worth a look. Underrated.
