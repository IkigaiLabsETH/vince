# Izanami Islands

OpenSea Slug: `izanami-islands-by-richard-nadler`

## The Artist

Richard Nadler is a Munich-based digital artist (b. 1987) with a deep connection to Japan—childhood trips with his father, later travel and study. He moved from finance to digital art in 2021 and works with latent diffusion, GANs, and code. Izanami Islands dropped in December 2023: 128 pieces. The title references Izanami, the Shinto creator goddess who, with Izanagi, formed the Japanese archipelago (Kojiki). Nadler was inspired by reading Hokusai’s “The Great Wave off Kanagawa” in Okinawa. The project was exhibited in December 2023 and is on Verse and OpenSea. Highest sale ~$12.6K; 87 owners.

## Why It Matters

Izanami Islands sits at the intersection of Japanese myth, landscape, and generative/AI art. Nadler’s personal history gives it authenticity rather than pastiche. The small supply (128) and the “islands” concept create a tight, cohesive set. It’s part of his broader practice (Yamabushi’s Horizons, Kinoko Dreams, Ronin)—Japan as subject, memory as engine. For collectors who care about Japan-inspired NFT art or Nadler’s work, it’s a key project.

## The Art

Generative / AI-assisted. Landscape, island, wave—likely lush and atmospheric. The Hokusai reference suggests sea, horizon, and drama. Nadler often uses an “embroidery”-like texture; check the project for exact style. Outputs vary within a clear thematic range.

## Notable Pieces

128 supply. Highest sale ~$12.6K. Certain compositions and palettes will attract premiums. Check Verse and OpenSea for structure and activity.

## Context for Collectors

Verify platform (Verse, OpenSea) and contract. Nadler has multiple Japan-themed series; don’t confuse with Yamabushi or Kinoko. If you collect his work, Izanami Islands is core.

## Personal Take

Izanami Islands is a focused, sincere take on Japanese landscape and myth. Nadler’s backstory supports it. Underrated in broader NFT discourse; essential for Japan and Nadler collectors. Worth a look.
