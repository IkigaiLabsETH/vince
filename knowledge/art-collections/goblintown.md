# Goblintown

OpenSea Slug: `goblintown`

## The Artist

Truth Labs—a collective of web3 creators. They’d done Illuminati Collective, The 187; they were doxxed as the Goblintown team in 2022. Goblintown launched 2022: 9,999 CC0 goblins. “No roadmap. No Discord. No utility.” The vibe was absurdist, anti-hype—goblins grunting, ugly-cute, bear-market defiance. 1,000 held by the team; 900 raffled to Truth holders (5 per day over six months); 50 to IlluminatiDAO; 50 kept. They announced merch (goblin sauce, McGoblinburger truck at NFT.NYC). Truth members committed not to sell core assets while on the team. The reveal boosted their other collections.

## Why It Matters

Goblintown proved that “no utility” could be the utility. In a down market, the project leaned into chaos and meme. The lack of Discord and roadmap became a flex. CC0 enabled remixes. The doxx forced a narrative shift—anonymous goblins, known team. For collectors who care about meme cycles, bear-market culture, and anti-establishment NFT energy, Goblintown is a reference. It’s often cited as a “weird” 2022 moment.

## The Art

Goblins. Ugly-cute, grunting, chaotic. Trait-driven but deliberately low-fi. The aesthetic is “refuse to be pretty.” Meme-first.

## Notable Pieces

9,999 supply. Rarity and community favourites trade higher. Floor and volume have shifted. Check OpenSea for structure. Truth Labs’ other projects can affect sentiment.

## Context for Collectors

CC0. No formal utility or roadmap. Verify you’re on the canonical Goblintown collection. Liquidity has varied. You’re buying meme and moment as much as “art.”

## Personal Take

Goblintown was a mood. It captured bear-market nihilism and turned it into a collectible. I’d rank it as “essential for 2022 NFT culture” but not as a long-term art hold. Not overrated as moment; possibly overrated as asset. Worth knowing.
