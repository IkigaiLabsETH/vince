# Highrises

OpenSea Slug: `highrises`

## The Artist

Hythacg created Highrises in April 2022: 171 NFTs on Ethereum. The collection depicts iconic American skyscrapers and early-20th-century architectural detail. It’s documentary and architectural—buildings as subject, not backdrop. The aesthetic is clean and graphic; the focus is on structure, era, and place. (Note: “Highrises” on OpenSea is this art collection. Other “Highrise” projects—e.g. Highrise Creature Club, Highrise LAND—are separate game/metaverse efforts on other chains.)

## Why It Matters

Highrises is a focused architectural NFT set. Skyscrapers and early modern design have a built-in audience—architecture fans, urban-history buffs. The 171 supply creates scarcity without oversaturating. Floor has often been around 0.25 ETH; total volume in the tens of ETH. It’s a niche but coherent “architecture as art” project. For collectors who care about buildings, cities, or documentary-style NFT art, it’s a clear fit.

## The Art

Architectural imagery. Skyscrapers, façades, details. Style is likely photographic or highly rendered—clear, representational. The early-20th-century angle suggests Art Deco, Beaux-Arts, or similar. Check OpenSea for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

171 supply. Rarity and demand depend on building, angle, and composition. Check secondary for current activity. Liquidity is moderate; it’s a holder-oriented collection.

## Context for Collectors

Verify you’re on the Ethereum “Highrises” art collection, not a game or metaverse project. Architecture NFT liquidity can be thinner than PFP or generative. You’re buying the image and the theme.

## Personal Take

Highrises is a straightforward architectural play. It doesn’t try to be anything else. If you like buildings and cities as art, it’s worth knowing. Niche but solid.
