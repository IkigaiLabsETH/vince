# Machine Hallucinations: Coral — Generative AI Data Painting

OpenSea Slug: `machine-hallucinations-coral-generative-ai-data-pa`

## The Artist

Refik Anadol again. Machine Hallucinations: Coral launched during Miami Art Week 2021 with Aorist and Faena Hotel Miami Beach. His studio gathered 1.7M+ coral images from public sources, ran them through ML models, and let the system “hallucinate” alternative shapes and colours. The outputs form a “latent cosmos” of fluid, organic forms. The project also included site-specific data sculpture and physical presence in Miami. Proceeds went to The ReefLine—artificial reef and marine habitat work in Miami Beach. So it’s art, data, and climate-adjacent impact.

## Why It Matters

Coral is a flagship Machine Hallucinations chapter. It proved that big, data-driven AI art could scale to editions, sculptures, and institutional partnerships. Coral Dreams (1/1) sold for $851K; Generative AI Data Paintings (100 each across five variants) and Artificial Reef (500) created accessible entry points. The ReefLine tie-in gave it an environmental story. For anyone tracking Anadol or “AI data painting,” Coral is a core reference. The slug often appears in truncated form (e.g. machine-hallucinations-coral-generative-ai-data-pa) on OpenSea and aggregators.

## The Art

Generative AI data painting. Flowing, abstract coral-like forms—colour, texture, motion. The look is recognisably Anadol: lush, immersive, between abstraction and nature. Editions vary within each series; the 1/1 and the three AI Data Sculptures sit at the top of the pyramid.

## Notable Pieces

**Coral Dreams** – 1/1, ~$851K.

**Generative AI Data Paintings A–E** – 100 editions each; last sold around $2K per.

**Artificial Reef** – 500 editions; last sold around $500.

**AI Data Sculptures A, B, C** – 1 each. Top of the stack.

## Context for Collectors

Multiple sub-collections under the Coral umbrella. Confirm you’re buying the exact series and edition you want. The ReefLine donation is part of the narrative. Anadol’s market is strong; Condition and provenance are standard NFT.

## Personal Take

Coral is Anadol at his most “spectacle + impact.” The data pipeline, the Miami rollout, and the ReefLine link all land. It’s not subtle—it’s big, pretty, and purposeful. If you like Machine Hallucinations or AI data art, Coral is essential. The slug is a mouthful, but the project isn’t.
