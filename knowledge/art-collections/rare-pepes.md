# Rare Pepes

OpenSea Slug: `rare-pepes`

## The Artist

Various. Rare Pepes were community-minted Pepe the Frog variants on **Counterparty** (Bitcoin), starting September 2016. “Mike” issued the first token, RAREPEPE; Joe Looney built the Rare Pepe Wallet. A group of “Rare Pepe Scientists” curated submissions via the Rare Pepe Directory—vetting before mint. Cards traded for XCP or Pepe Cash on the Counterparty DEX. The project grew to 1,774 images in 36 series of 50 cards each. No single artist; it’s a collective, meme-native experiment. Predates Ethereum NFTs by a year. The Pepes live on Bitcoin; wrapped or bridged versions exist elsewhere.

## Why It Matters

Rare Pepes are the first meme NFTs. Counterparty proved you could attach images to tokens, enforce scarcity, and trade them on-chain. Ethereum and ERC-721 came later. Rare Pepes demonstrated verifiable ownership and provenance for digital art on a public ledger before “NFT” was a household term. Individual cards have sold for thousands. The project is a direct ancestor of CryptoPunks, Curio Cards, and everything that followed. If you care about NFT *history*, Rare Pepes are non-negotiable. They’re often overlooked because they’re on Bitcoin, not Ethereum—but they’re the real OGs.

## The Art

Pepe variants. Memes, parodies, rare designs. Low-res, internet-native. Each card has a fixed supply; rarity is enforced by the Directory and the protocol. The aesthetic is “early internet meme”—crude, funny, collectible. You’re not buying fine art; you’re buying culture and history.

## Notable Pieces

Series 1 and early cards carry the most historical weight. Specific “holy grail” Pepes have traded at significant sums. The collection is on Counterparty; secondary activity happens via dedicated wallets and platforms. Check Rare Pepe Directory and bridging sites for structure.

## Context for Collectors

Rare Pepes live on **Bitcoin** (Counterparty). If you’re used to OpenSea on Ethereum, the workflow is different. Wrapped versions exist but verify what you’re buying. You’re collecting meme history as much as “art.” Liquidity is niche. This is a collector’s project.

## Personal Take

Rare Pepes are underrated in mainstream NFT discourse. Ethereum gets the glory; Rare Pepes did it first on Bitcoin. They’re messy, silly, and foundational. If you’re building a “greatest hits” of NFT history, Rare Pepes belong in the first chapter. Not overrated—often *under*rated because they’re not on ETH. Essential for anyone who cares about origins.
