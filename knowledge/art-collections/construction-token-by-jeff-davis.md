# Construction Token

OpenSea Slug: `construction-token-by-jeff-davis`

## The Artist

Jeff Davis—Art Blocks co‑founder with Erick Calderon (Snowfro). Construction Token dropped 27 November 2020, one of the earliest Curated projects. He’s also behind Progression and other Art Blocks work. The platform’s editorial and curatorial voice is partly his. Construction Token is geometric, constraint-driven: rectangles, placement, colour from a randomised seed. Most outputs are monochrome; some have light/dark or complementary variants.

## Why It Matters

Construction Token was **lot 3** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—the 19 Art Blocks from Calderon and Davis. It’s foundational Art Blocks: simple rules, clear structure, no fluff. As a founder project, it’s literally part of the platform’s DNA. We have Progression; Construction Token is the earlier, more minimal sibling. Anyone tracking “first-wave” Art Blocks should know it.

## The Art

Algorithmic rectangles. The seed controls count, orientation, placement, and colour. Mostly monochrome; occasional two‑colour pieces. The look is spare, architectural, grid-like. Pure geometry.

## Notable Pieces

500 supply. Art Blocks Curated. Rarity and demand track structure and colour. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Same artist as Progression—different system, earlier release. Verify project and contract. Essential for Jeff Davis and Art Blocks history.

## Personal Take

Construction Token is “less is more” generative art. It’s not trying to impress with complexity. Solid, foundational, slightly underrated next to Progression.
