# Memories of Qilin

OpenSea Slug: `memories-of-qilin-by-emily-xie`

## The Artist

Emily Xie. Memories of Qilin dropped 21 March 2022, Art Blocks Curated: 1,024 pieces. JavaScript, p5.js. The project draws on East Asian art—folklore, mythology, dragons, phoenixes, flowers, mountains, classical painting and woodblock. The qilin (girin, kirin) is a mythological beast of prosperity and luck. Xie channels fluidity and movement; forms verge on representation but stay elusive. Token-limited physical prints (Hahnemühle, hand-signed) are available to holders.

## Why It Matters

Memories of Qilin proved that generative art could engage deeply with non-Western tradition without pastiche. The aesthetic is cohesive, the reference serious. Xie’s work has become a reference for “cultural generative” on Art Blocks. The print option ties digital to physical. For collectors who care about East Asian influence and textile-like pattern, Qilin is essential.

## The Art

Generative. Organic, flowing, sometimes floral or dragon-adjacent. Colour and form shift; the vibe is decorative, mythic. Outputs range from sparse to dense. Check the Art Blocks project and emilyxie.art for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

1,024 supply. Certain compositions and palettes trade higher. Xie’s name and the print option support demand. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. 1,024 fixed. Prints are holder-specific; confirm current terms. If you like cultural generative art, Qilin is a must.

## Personal Take

Memories of Qilin is confident, distinctive work. The tradition isn’t surface-level. Underrated in broad Art Blocks discourse. Worth a close look.
