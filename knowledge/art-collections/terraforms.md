# Terraforms

OpenSea Slug: `terraforms`

## The Artist

Mathcastles—the duo 0x113d and xaltgeist—are anonymous developers. They built Terraforms and dropped it in December 2021. The project is a single on-chain world: 11,104 parcels of generative land art, fully stored on Ethereum. No IPFS, no external renders. The logic and the output live on-chain. They’ve been sparing with public presence; the work carries most of the weight.

## Why It Matters

Terraforms might be the most ambitious on-chain generative project ever attempted. Every parcel is rendered as animated art on a 32×32 grid of characters—Unicode, ASCII, SVG—viewable directly from the chain. The whole set forms a “hypercastle”: a 3D structure, 20 levels, narrowing at top and bottom. Each NFT has a coordinate (e.g. “Level 2 at {2,1}”); you own a slice of a shared structure. That’s not just “we have a world”—it’s “the world _is_ the data structure.”

There are three modes: Terrain (original animated land), Daydream (draw on your NFT—irreversible), and Terraform (commit drawings on-chain for others to see—reversible). So it’s art, map, and software. Traits include Zone (75 palettes), Biome (92 character sets), Chroma (animation speed). The combination of scale, on-chain completeness, and interactivity is still rare.

## The Art

Text-based landscapes. Blocks of characters form terrain, vegetation, architecture. Colours and density vary by Zone and Biome. Animation (Chroma) adds motion. Some parcels feel like overworld maps; others like abstract grids. The constraint—everything in UTF/SVG—creates a consistent, lo-fi beauty. It’s deliberately not high-rez 3D.

## Notable Pieces

11,104 parcels. Floor and volume have moved with the market. Rare Zones, Biomes, and level positions trade at a premium. Daydream draws can add or subtract value depending on the piece and the buyer. The hypercastle structure means level and position matter for “location” within the world.

## Context for Collectors

Supply is fixed. Daydream changes are permanent; Terraform commits can be reverted. Understand what you’re altering before you draw. The project is technically dense—read the docs, look at a few parcels, and make sure you’re into the aesthetic. This isn’t a casual PFP flip.

## Personal Take

Terraforms is underrated in the “greatest on-chain experiments” conversation. The hypercastle, the three modes, the fact that it’s all on-chain—it’s a technical and conceptual milestone. The art won’t be for everyone, but if you care about generative systems and on-chain integrity, Terraforms deserves attention. One of the projects I’d point to when someone says “what can you really do on-chain?”
