# Dataland — Biome Lumina

OpenSea Slug: `dataland-biomelumina`

## The Artist

Refik Anadol Studio created Biome Lumina for Dataland. It launched in May 2025—1,000 NFTs on Ethereum. The project uses a “Large Nature Model” trained on 2.4M images of flora, fauna, and fungi, plus rainforest sound and biosensor data. Each piece is a “living painting” that evolves from real-time environmental data (LiDAR, photogrammetry, sensors) from rainforests worldwide. Structure and luminescence shift with incoming data. Collectors get three outputs: the generative AI data painting, a 24"×44" museum-quality print, and a “living painting” on My.Dataland that responds to live data. The collection sold out 13 May 2025. Floor has often been around 1.2 ETH; volume over 1,400 ETH. 303 unique owners.

## Why It Matters

Biome Lumina pushes “data + nature + NFT” further. Real rainforest data drives the art; the print and the living painting extend it beyond the token. Dataland positions itself as a nature–tech platform; Anadol’s presence adds weight. The triple output (NFT, print, living painting) is a clear value proposition. For collectors who care about environmental data, living systems, or Anadol’s practice, it’s a core project. The sell-out and volume reflect real demand.

## The Art

Generative AI data painting. Organic, flowing forms—forest, flora, light. The “luminescence” and “biome” ideas show up in colour and structure. Outputs vary by data and seed. The look is recognisably Anadol: lush, immersive, between abstraction and nature.

## Notable Pieces

1,000 supply, sold out. Secondary on OpenSea. Certain “biomes” and data streams may command premiums. The print and living-painting layers add collectible dimensions beyond the NFT.

## Context for Collectors

Verify you’re buying the Dataland Biome Lumina collection. Understand what you get: NFT, print eligibility, My.Dataland access. Check Dataland and OpenSea for current terms. Anadol’s market is strong; liquidity is reasonable.

## Personal Take

Biome Lumina is Anadol doing “nature as data” at scale. The triple output and the rainforest hook make it distinctive. If you like Machine Hallucinations or environmental AI art, it’s essential. Not overrated.
