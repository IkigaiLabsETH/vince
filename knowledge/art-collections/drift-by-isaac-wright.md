# Drift

OpenSea Slug: `drift-by-isaac-wright`

## The Artist

Isaac “Drift” Wright again. Drift is his broader practice—urban exploration, photography, the “DrifterShoots” identity. Where My Vans Go is the flagship 131-piece set; “Drift” can refer to other drops, series, or the artist’s work generally. He’s on SuperRare, Foundation, Nifty Gateway, OpenSea. The plugin uses “drift-by-isaac-wright” as a distinct slug; verify whether it maps to a specific collection or to his output as a whole.

## Why It Matters

Drift / Isaac Wright is a reference point for analog-style, documentary photography in NFTs. His imagery—heights, risk, city—and his story (veteran, arrest, non-profit) created a clear brand. If “drift-by-isaac-wright” denotes a particular set, it likely shares that documentary, place-based DNA. For photo NFT collectors, Wright is essential; the exact collection depends on slug verification.

## The Art

Photography. Urban exploration, elevated perspectives, raw documentary. Style aligns with Where My Vans Go: vertigo, scale, narrative. Verify the specific project for precise outputs.

## Notable Pieces

Supply and structure depend on the “drift-by-isaac-wright” collection. Check OpenSea and Wright’s platforms for current activity. His name supports demand across his work.

## Context for Collectors

Confirm what “drift-by-isaac-wright” refers to—single collection vs. artist page. Photography NFT liquidity varies by project. You’re buying Wright’s practice and story as much as a single image.

## Personal Take

Wright’s work holds up. If Drift is a distinct set, it’s worth knowing. If it’s umbrella branding, his other drops (e.g. Where My Vans Go) are the anchors. Not overrated. Essential for photo NFT context.
