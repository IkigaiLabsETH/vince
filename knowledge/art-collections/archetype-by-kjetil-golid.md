# Archetype

OpenSea Slug: `archetype-by-kjetil-golid`

## The Artist

Kjetil Golid is a generative artist from Trondheim, Norway. He uses code as a creative tool—algorithms, structure, repetition. Archetype dropped on Art Blocks Curated in February 2021, one of the earlier Curated releases. He’s written clearly about the system (e.g. “Archetype 101” on Medium): rectangle partitioning, recursion, grids. The work is geometric and precise; you can see the logic even when the output feels complex. He’s done other projects (Risk Reward, Orbifold) that explore related ideas.

## Why It Matters

Archetype nails “simple rules, rich output.” The algorithm splits rectangles, subdivides into cells, applies partitions again. Repetition balances randomness: individually chaotic, collectively coherent. That tension—control vs. emergence—is classic generative art, and Golid executes it without bloat. The collection helped establish that Art Blocks could host rigorous, systematic work, not just eye-catching visuals.

It’s also one of the earlier Golid projects people point to when they talk about his style. Risk Reward and Orbifold extend the conversation; Archetype is where it starts for a lot of collectors.

## The Art

Recursive rectangular partitions. The algorithm creates sections, turns them into cell grids, then partitions within each cell. Shared sections share structure; variation comes from parameters. There are traits—Framed (575 framed, 25 unframed), Shading (Noon, Morning, Evening, Bright), Scene (flat vs. cube), Palette, Layout—so you get a mix of minimal grids and busier, more layered compositions. The look is geometric, abstract, often architectural. Nothing figurative; pure structure and colour.

## Notable Pieces

600 pieces total. The 25 unframed are rarer; certain palettes and layouts trade higher. Archetype doesn’t have a single mythic sale like the Goose, but it’s a steady Curated project with a recognised artist and a clear aesthetic. Secondary volume and floor reflect that—solid, not sensational.

## Context for Collectors

600 supply. Art Blocks Curated. Fixed. Collectors tend to care about structure, palette, and sometimes frame vs. unframed. If you like geometric generative art and clean systems, Archetype is a good fit. Golid’s essays and process docs are worth reading before you buy.

## Personal Take

Archetype is a “designer’s generative art” pick. It’s rigorous, it’s readable, and it doesn’t rely on vibes. Golid is one of the artists I’d point to when someone says “generative art is random screensavers.” It’s not—there’s a full system here.

I don’t think it’s overrated. It’s less talked about than Fidenza or Ringers, but it’s foundational for a certain kind of collector. If you’re into structure, recursion, and minimalism, Archetype belongs on your radar. Maybe on your wall too.
