# Cryptoblots

OpenSea Slug: `cryptoblots-by-daim-aggott-honsch`

## The Artist

Daïm Aggott-Hönsch (DaimAlYad)—Hungarian-Canadian algorist and AI artist based in Toronto. He builds custom algorithms for abstract and thematic work. Cryptoblots was an early Art Blocks Curated release (2020). He’s since done Thereidoscope and other projects; his work has appeared at the Museum of Crypto Art, Royal Cornwall Museum, and Hungary’s Digital Art Biennial. He’s often described as an “Apeirographer,” working with infinite or near-infinite possibility spaces.

## Why It Matters

Cryptoblots was **lot 4** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks. It explores **pareidolia**: we see meaning in random patterns. The algorithm produces abstract shapes; interpretation is left to the viewer. Earlier versions were greyscale; later ones added colour. The project showed that Art Blocks could host conceptual, perception-driven work, not just pattern or geometry.

## The Art

Indeterminate abstract shapes. Blot-like, organic. Colour or greyscale. The algorithm sets the structure; we project the meaning. Traits and palettes vary. The aesthetic sits between abstraction and figuration.

## Notable Pieces

Art Blocks Curated. Supply fixed. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks for structure. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was part of the 19‑work lot.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. If you like perceptual and conceptual generative art, Cryptoblots is a reference. Verify project and contract.

## Personal Take

Cryptoblots is a thoughtful, underrated entry in the Natively Digital set. The pareidolia angle gives it a distinct hook. Worth a look.
