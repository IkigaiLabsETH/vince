# Bored Ape Yacht Club

OpenSea Slug: `boredapeyachtclub`

## The Artist

Yuga Labs—Gargamel, Gordon Goner, No Sass, Emperor Tomato Ketchup. Four founders, pseudonymous. BAYC launched 30 April 2021: 10,000 procedurally generated cartoon apes, ~$200 mint. The aesthetic is deliberately “bored” hipster: leather jackets, cigs, laser eyes, gold fur, weird hats. Each NFT doubled as membership to the “Yacht Club”—Discord, IRL events, commercial IP rights to your ape. The project cleared seven figures in primary sales and nearly $100M in volume within months. BAKC (June 2021) and MAYC (August 2021) followed. Yuga later acquired CryptoPunks and Meebits, then spun off Meebits. BAYC became the PFP that everybody outside crypto had heard of.

## Why It Matters

BAYC defined PFP culture at scale. Apes as Twitter avatars, celebrity adoption, collaboration over conflict. The membership model and IP rights gave holders something beyond “I own a picture.” Whether you think the art is good or not is almost beside the point—it became a status symbol. Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, every major outlet covered it. The ecosystem (MAYC, Otherside, ApeCoin) extended the brand. Culturally, you can’t tell the 2021 NFT story without BAYC. From a pure art perspective, it’s design and vibes; from a market and culture perspective, it’s seminal.

## The Art

Cartoon apes. Procedurally generated traits—background, fur, clothes, accessories, expression. The style is graphic, bold, slightly satire. Some are iconic (gold fur, laser eyes); others are “floor.” The constraint is clear; the variety is huge. It’s PFP art: identity and flex first, gallery second.

## Notable Pieces

**#8817** — Golden fur, laser eyes. One of the most recognisable. Trading in the hundreds of ETH at peak.

**#8585** — Another grail. Rarity and meme appeal drive premiums.

Floor apes vs. blue-chip traits trade in different leagues. Check OpenSea for current structure. Celebrity-held apes often attract attention.

## Context for Collectors

10,000 supply. Trait rarity matters for premium pieces; floor is “entry.” IP rights allow commercial use—that was a big sell. The Yuga ecosystem (Otherside, ApeCoin) can affect narrative and demand. Be clear whether you’re buying art, status, or utility. Liquidity is high; it’s one of the most traded NFT collections.

## Personal Take

BAYC is the PFP that made PFPs impossible to ignore. I don’t think the artwork is the point—it’s the club, the flex, the fact that your mum has heard of it. From an art-collector lens, the Art Blocks and 1/1 stuff is more interesting. But you can’t write NFT history without BAYC. Not overrated as culture; possibly overrated as art. Depends what you’re optimising for.
