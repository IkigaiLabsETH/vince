# HyperHash

OpenSea Slug: `hyperhash-by-beervangeer`

## The Artist

Beervangeer. HyperHash is an Art Blocks Curated project from 2020. It was **lot 10** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks. The name suggests hash-derived structure, perhaps literal or conceptual use of blockchain data. The output is algorithmically generated. Detailed artist bio is sparse, but inclusion in the foundational Sotheby’s lot anchors it in Art Blocks history.

## Why It Matters

HyperHash belongs to the canonical Natively Digital set. That sale marked generative NFTs’ entry into major auctions. Every project in the 19‑work lot shares that legacy. It’s less discussed than Chromie Squiggle or Ringers but historically part of the same moment.

## The Art

Generative. “Hash” implies algorithmic, possibly data-derived structure. Aesthetic and traits vary by seed. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

Art Blocks Curated. Supply fixed. Check secondary for activity. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Important for Natively Digital completeness.

## Personal Take

HyperHash is an underrated entry in the 2021 cohort. Worth knowing for the full Sotheby’s set.
