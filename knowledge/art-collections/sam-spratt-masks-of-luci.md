# Masks of Luci

OpenSea Slug: `sam-spratt-masks-of-luci`

## The Artist

Sam Spratt is a digital artist known for ambitious narrative work. Masks of Luci, released January 2025, continues “the story of Luci” after The Monument Game. The project blends art, community, and “modern exegesis”—choices, connections, and “true nature” revealed through how others interact with his work and world. The “masquerade” framing implies identity, performance, and disguise. 613 unique pieces on Ethereum. Spratt has built a coherent universe around Luci; this is another chapter.

## Why It Matters

Masks of Luci extends a recurring mythos. You’re not just buying an image; you’re buying into a story that unfolds across projects. The 613 supply and the narrative layer create a dedicated collector base. Recent sales have ranged into the teens of thousands of dollars (e.g. The Rock of Men, Ash Made Gospels, Liquidity Pool). The project ranks highly among NFT collections by market activity. Spratt’s ambition—art plus worldbuilding plus community—makes it a reference point for “artist-led narrative” NFTs.

## The Art

Digital art. Figurative, symbolic, often mask-like or character-driven. The aesthetic is polished and intentional—fine-art adjacent. Pieces have distinct names and identities (e.g. The Rock of Men, Ash Made Gospels). Check the project page and Verse/OpenSea for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

**The Rock of Men** – ~$16.7K.

**Ash Made Gospels** – ~$16K.

**Liquidity Pool** – ~$15.6K.

Floor has often been around 4.85–6.85 ETH; highest recorded sale ~$20.6K. ~131 owners. Check OpenSea, OKX, and Verse for current activity.

## Context for Collectors

613 supply, fixed. Narrative and community are part of the value. If you care about Luci / The Monument Game, Masks of Luci is core. Verify contract and platform. Liquidity can be concentrated.

## Personal Take

Masks of Luci is serious narrative NFT art. Spratt commits to the bit—story, character, world. The sales and ranking reflect real demand. If you like artist-built universes, it’s a must-know. Not overrated.
