# HOODIES by JakNFT

OpenSea Slug: `jaknfthoodies`

## The Artist

JakNFT is the creator. HOODIES launched in October 2021. Max supply 99—ever. Initial drop was 33 pieces at 1 ETH each. Further releases are unscheduled and random. No roadmap, no traits. Each HOODIE is meant to “look rare” on its own. Utility is art. The vibe is casual, minimalist, slightly meme-adjacent. #HOODIEGANG is the community tag. There’s a companion set, DOS HOODIES: one matching HOODIE per original holder, free to claim. Same 99-max structure.

## Why It Matters

HOODIES is a tight, supply-capped 1/1-ish project. The “no properties, each looks rare” setup pushes against trait-sniper culture. You’re buying the image and the vibe, not a spreadsheet. The 99 cap and random future mints create scarcity and anticipation. JakNFT has kept the project focused—no bloated utility, just art and community. It’s stayed relevant as a “collect what you like” example.

## The Art

Hoodies. Stylised, often minimal. Each piece is unique; the artist controls the look rather than an algorithm. Colours, composition, and style vary. The aesthetic is streetwear-adjacent, internet-native. Easy to recognise as a set.

## Notable Pieces

99 max. Floor has often been around 1–1.5 ETH; volume in the hundreds of ETH. High holder concentration—most aren’t listed. DOS HOODIES add a paired collectible for holders. The random future mints keep the project alive.

## Context for Collectors

99 supply, no planned schedule for the rest. If you want in, you’re buying secondary. No traits to optimise—pick what you like. Creator fees (e.g. 10%) on secondary. DOS claims are for HOODIE holders; check current rules.

## Personal Take

HOODIES is a refreshingly simple project. No fake utility, no trait grind—just art and a hard cap. JakNFT committed to the constraint. It’s not a blue chip in the Punks sense, but it’s a solid “collector favourite” with a clear identity. I like it for that.
