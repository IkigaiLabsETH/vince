# Deadfellaz

OpenSea Slug: `deadfellaz`

## The Artist

Betty and Psych. Betty comes from creative production; Psych is an illustrator (psychedelic influence). Both learned about NFTs in early 2021 via artist collectives. Deadfellaz launched August 2021: 9,999 horror-themed PFPs. They wanted more gender diversity and representation; the characters are deliberately ungendered. Influences: zombie films, 90s animation, streetwear, music, gaming, queer culture. The Fellaz are “cured” undead in quarantined zones; “Dead Zone 13.” DeadFrenz (companion creatures) came later. Betty revealed her identity in 2024; she’d stayed anonymous to avoid “the male gaze” and protect privacy.

## Why It Matters

Deadfellaz proved that horror and queer-coded aesthetics could sustain a blue-chip PFP. The representation angle and the “no assigned gender” approach stood out. The project attracted brand deals and a loyal community. For collectors who care about diversity, horror, and early PFP culture, Deadfellaz is a reference. It’s often cited as a “different” flavour of 2021 success.

## The Art

Horror PFP. Undead, experimental, 300+ traits. The style is cohesive—gritty, character-driven. Meme-friendly but distinct. It’s PFP first, gallery second.

## Notable Pieces

9,999 supply. Rare traits and community favourites trade higher. Floor and volume have fluctuated. Check OpenSea for structure. DeadFrenz and Betty’s reveal can affect narrative.

## Context for Collectors

You’re buying into the Deadfellaz brand and community. Verify you’re on the flagship collection. Liquidity is moderate. This is “horror + representation” PFP as much as “art.”

## Personal Take

Deadfellaz earned its place. The aesthetic and the mission cohere. Not overrated. Worth knowing for horror and representation in NFTs.
