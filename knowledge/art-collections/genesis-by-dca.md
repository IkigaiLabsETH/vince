# Genesis

OpenSea Slug: `genesis-by-dca`

## The Artist

Daniel Calderon Arenas (DCA)—Houston-based educator and generative artist. He’s been doing generative work since 2017, exploring language, meaning, and natural phenomena through code. Genesis was one of his first Art Blocks drops. He’s since done Marfa Yucca (Explorations), Gen 2 and Gen 3 (Playground), and collabs with Bright Moments and Squiggle DAO. He teaches coding and digital processes at K. G. McGovern College of the Arts. His work often reinterprets natural systems—branching, rock formations—with careful colour and algorithmic chance.

## Why It Matters

Genesis was part of Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** Lot 4 (June 2021): 19 Art Blocks works from founders Erick Calderon and Jeff Davis. It was the **second** project in that lot (after Chromie Squiggle). The sale helped legitimise generative NFTs in traditional auctions. Genesis itself interprets block hashes into visual output—grids, gradients, lines, shapes—so each piece is tied to the mint transaction. It’s early Art Blocks Curated and historically significant even if it’s less discussed than Fidenza or Ringers.

## The Art

Algorithmic compositions from hash-derived parameters. Grids, lines, rectangles, trapezoids, triangles; traits like “Grid: Diagonal,” “Line: Pickup-sticks,” “Triangle1: All.” The aesthetic is geometric, abstract, systematic. Palette and structure vary by seed. The work feels minimal and logical—code as composition.

## Notable Pieces

Supply is fixed (Art Blocks Curated, original contract). Genesis #0 and low IDs attract attention. Floor has often sat around 2+ ETH. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks for current structure. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was part of the 19‑work lot.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify you’re on the Genesis-by-DCA project and contract. If you care about Art Blocks history and the Natively Digital moment, Genesis belongs on the list.

## Personal Take

Genesis is an underrated piece of Art Blocks lore. It’s not as flashy as later Curated drops, but it was in the room when generative art crossed into the auction world. Worth knowing for collectors who care about origins.
