# Ethereal Fragments

OpenSea Slug: `ethereal-fragments-by-pplpleasr`

## The Artist

Pplpleasr (Emily Yang)—NFT artist known for DeFi visuals. She made viral animations for Aave, SushiSwap, Uniswap. Her breakout was “x*y=k,” the Uniswap V3 unicorn NFT. PleasrDAO won it for 310 ETH (~$525K); she donated all proceeds to Stand With Asians. That auction spawned PleasrDAO, which later bought Edward Snowden’s first NFT ($5M+), the Doge photo ($4M+), and more. She’s done Fortune covers, Shibuya (interactive NFT video), and Ethereal Fragments. The plugin lists “ethereal-fragments-by-pplpleasr” as DeFi art pioneer, Uniswap collaboration. She prefers Rarible and Foundation over OpenSea.

## Why It Matters

Ethereal Fragments ties DeFi culture to NFT art. Pplpleasr helped define “DeFi aesthetic”—clean, symbolic, protocol-friendly. The Uniswap drop and the PleasrDAO story made her a reference for “artist as ecosystem.” Ethereal Fragments extends that: likely animation, abstraction, or conceptual work linked to DeFi or collaboration. For collectors who care about DeFi art and narrative, pplpleasr is essential.

## The Art

Likely animation, graphic, or conceptual. Her work tends to be polished, symbolic, sometimes whimsical (unicorns, protocols). Verify the specific Ethereal Fragments outputs on her platforms and OpenSea.

## Notable Pieces

Structure depends on the Ethereal Fragments drop. Her Uniswap “x*y=k” and other 1/1s have sold at major levels. Check Foundation, Rarible, OpenSea for activity.

## Context for Collectors

Pplpleasr is multi-platform; she favours Rarible and Foundation. Verify you’re on the Ethereal Fragments collection and contract. You’re buying DeFi-art history and her practice.

## Personal Take

Pplpleasr earned her place. The Uniswap work and the PleasrDAO arc are part of NFT history. Ethereal Fragments fits that story. Not overrated. Essential for DeFi art.
