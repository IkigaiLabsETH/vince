# XCOPY (KnownOrigin)

OpenSea Slug: `xcopy-knownorigin`

## The Artist

XCOPY is a London-based digital artist who’s been anonymous since he started posting work in the mid-2010s. Glitch aesthetics, loops, distortion—death, dystopia, apathy. He was minting NFTs by 2018, before most people had heard the term. KnownOrigin became his primary home. The style is instantly recognisable: chopped visuals, strobe-like motion, a kind of nihilistic clarity. He’s one of the highest-selling NFT artists ever, and he’s been making the same argument about technology and mortality for years. A lot of people still don’t get it.

## Why It Matters

XCOPY helped define what “NFT art” could be beyond PFPs and pump-and-dump projects. He proved you could build a career and a market on 1/1s with a coherent visual language. The KnownOrigin collection—hundreds of pieces—functions as a single body of work: consistent themes, recurring motifs, a clear point of view. Collectors don’t just buy “an XCOPY”; they buy into the project.

He also went CC0 in 2022. All his non-collaborative work, past and future, dedicated to the public domain. No copyright. That move reframed a lot of debates about ownership, derivatives, and what artists owe the space. Love it or hate it, it mattered.

## The Art

Glitch art. Digital distortion, often looping—GIFs or video. Faces, skulls, figures, text. The palette tends toward high contrast, sometimes neon on black. There’s a punk, DIY quality: it feels like it could’ve been made in a bedroom, and it was. The technical skill is in the control of chaos—knowing exactly how much to break. Pieces like “The Deadness,” “The Damage,” “RESIST” revolve around death, resistance, and crypto-culture references. It’s not subtle. It’s not supposed to be.

## Notable Pieces

**Right-Click and Save As Guy** – Sold for around $7M in December 2021. The meme, the statement, the flagship. If you know one XCOPY, it’s probably this one.

The KnownOrigin collection holds the bulk of his output. Floor and total volume are substantial; individual pieces trade on recognisability, theme, and timing. “The Deadness” and “The Damage” are often cited. Big sales tend to be 1/1s with strong narrative or historical weight.

## Context for Collectors

The xcopy-knownorigin set on OpenSea aggregates his KnownOrigin work. Hundreds of items, one artist. Floor has been in the teens (ETH); total volume is in the thousands of ETH. These aren’t cheap.

People collect XCOPY for the aesthetic, the CC0 stance, and the belief that he’s one of the few NFT artists with a real, lasting voice. The anonymity adds to the myth. There’s no “team,” no roadmap—just the work. That appeals to a certain kind of collector.

Watch out for editions vs 1/1s. Know what you’re buying. And if you’re derivative-minded, the CC0 move means you can use the work—but so can everyone else.

## Personal Take

XCOPY has been making the same point about death and tech for years, and it still lands. The work is repetitive by design; the repetition _is_ the point. Not every piece is a banger, but the body of work holds together. I find the best ones unsettling in a good way—they don’t let you look away.

From a market angle, he’s blue-chip 1/1. The KnownOrigin collection is the canonical place to own him. Whether the prices are justified depends on how much you value consistency, concept, and cultural impact over sheer novelty. I think he’s earned it. Overrated? No. Underrated by traditional art? Probably. If you’re building a “greatest hits” NFT art collection, he belongs in it.
