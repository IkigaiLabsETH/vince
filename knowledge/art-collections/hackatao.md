# Hackatao

OpenSea Slug: `hackatao`

## The Artist

Hackatao is an Italian duo—S and N, pseudonymous. They’ve been collaborating since 2007 in Milan. Before NFTs they made Podmorks: small totemic ceramic sculptures, surreal, animated digitally from 2012. They joined the NFT space in 2018. The name fuses “Hack” (penetration into consciousness) and “Tao” (balance). Their work explores humanity, technology, and blockchain. They’ve done 9,000+ tokens, $27M+ in sales, #3 on SuperRare. Sotheby’s and Christie’s have featured them. They stay anonymous and avoid personal exposure.

## Why It Matters

Hackatao are crypto-art pioneers. 2018 puts them in the first wave. Their dualistic, symbolic style—Queens+Kings, totems, ritual—became a reference for “NFT art” before the PFP wave. The combination of tradition (ceramic, myth) and tech (blockchain, digital) landed. For collectors who care about NFT *history* and artist-led work, Hackatao are essential. The “hackatao” slug often aggregates their output across platforms.

## The Art

Symbolic, often dualistic. Characters, totems, ritual imagery. Vibrant colour, clear graphic style. The work ranges from static to animated. Queens+Kings and similar series are benchmarks. Check OpenSea and hackatao.com for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

Thousands of tokens across series. Key works have sold at major houses. Rarity and recognition vary by piece. Check OpenSea and SuperRare for activity. Hackatao’s name supports demand.

## Context for Collectors

“Hackatao” can mean the artist or a specific collection. Verify what you’re buying. They’re multi-platform (SuperRare, OpenSea, etc.). You’re buying pioneering crypto art and symbolic, duo-made work.

## Personal Take

Hackatao earned their place. They were early, consistent, and conceptually clear. Underrated in mainstream NFT discourse; correctly celebrated by historians. Essential for “OG” crypto art.
