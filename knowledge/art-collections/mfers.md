# mfers

OpenSea Slug: `mfers`

## The Artist

Sartoshi. mfers launched late 2021—CC0, no roadmap, no ruler. Simple stick-figure-style characters, “mfer” vibe, meme-native. The project was designed to evolve bottom-up: the community decides. In June 2022, Sartoshi “ended,” transferred the contract to a multi-sig of seven OGs, and restructured royalties (50% to community multi-sig, 25% to Sartoshi, 15% to westcoastnft, 10% to other devs). A final open edition dropped. He later did mfercoin on Base. mfers became a reference for CC0, decentralisation, and “no roadmap” as ethos.

## Why It Matters

mfers proved that a meme-native, CC0 project could build real culture and value. “No roadmap” was the roadmap. The contract handover and royalty split made the community the owner. The aesthetic is deliberately simple—anyone can remix, and they did. For collectors who care about CC0, meme culture, and decentralised ownership, mfers is essential. It’s often cited alongside Nouns and CrypToadz as “culture over utility.”

## The Art

Simple line-drawn characters. “Mfer” poses, vibes. Minimal, meme-ready. The constraint is the joke. Trait variety exists but the point is attitude and CC0.

## Notable Pieces

Supply is fixed at mint. No formal rarity; community favourites and early IDs trade higher. Check OpenSea for structure. mfercoin and Sartoshi’s “return” or adjacent projects can affect sentiment.

## Context for Collectors

CC0—art is in the public domain. You own the token and the meme, not exclusive IP. The contract is community-held. Verify you’re on the canonical mfers collection. Liquidity has varied.

## Personal Take

mfers earned it. The satire, the CC0, the handover—it all coheres. I’d rank it as “essential for CC0 and meme culture” but not as a traditional art collectible. Not overrated. Worth knowing.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
