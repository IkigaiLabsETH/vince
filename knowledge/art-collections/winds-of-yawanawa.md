# Winds of Yawanawa

OpenSea Slug: `winds-of-yawanawa`

## The Artist

Refik Anadol is a prominent new-media artist known for data-driven installations and AI work. The Yawanawá are an Indigenous people of the Brazilian Amazon. Winds of Yawanawa is a collaboration: Anadol’s systems plus cultural and artistic input from the community. The project was commissioned by Impact One, with Scorpios, and launched in July 2023 via Possible Futures. It’s built to direct benefits back to the Yawanawá—land protection, infrastructure, education—through Instituto Nixiwaka.

## Why It Matters

Winds of Yawanawa is one of the highest-profile NFT projects to partner seriously with an Indigenous community. Real-time weather data from the Yawanawá sacred village, Aldeia Sagrada—wind speed, direction, temperature—feeds Anadol’s algorithms. Drawings by young Yawanawá artists Nawashahu and Mukashahu are animated and blended into the outputs. Each piece connects to one of nine origins in Yawanawá cosmology: Sun, Water, Earth, Moon, Forest, Fire, Star, Wind, Sky. Traditional chants appear as sound. The result is hybrid: data painting, AI, and living culture.

Sales reportedly topped $3 million, with proceeds going to the community. The work has been shown at Scorpios Mykonos and Annabel’s in London. It’s a reference point for “NFTs + Indigenous rights + climate” whether you love or critique the format.

## The Art

1,000 unique data paintings plus 3 data sculptures. Flowing, organic visuals—wind and weather translated into form and colour. The aesthetic is recognisably Anadol: lush, immersive, sometimes abstract, sometimes figurative. The Yawanawá drawings add a human, hand-made layer. It’s meditative and dense rather than minimal.

## Notable Pieces

The collection trades as a set; individual standouts are often those with strong cosmological links or striking palettes. Primary sales drove most of the volume; secondary activity depends on the market. The 3 sculptures occupy a distinct tier.

## Context for Collectors

Understand what you’re buying: art tied to a specific community and cause. The ethical framing—funding land and culture—is part of the project’s identity. If that matters to you, it’s a feature. If you only care about flip potential, look elsewhere. Check Possible Futures and Impact One for current info on use of proceeds.

## Personal Take

Winds of Yawanawa is meaningful as both art and model. Anadol’s tech is polished; the collaboration and the flow of benefits are what make it historically notable. It’s not immune to critique—collaborations across power and culture never are—but it’s a serious attempt to route NFT value toward Indigenous stewardship. I’d treat it as a “know this exists” project: significant for the space, regardless of whether you collect it.
