# Monster Soup

OpenSea Slug: `monstersoup`

## The Artist

Des Lucréce is the artist. Monster Soup is a set of 100 soup-can designs, each in his “Monsters” style across four colour ways. The cans riff on Warholian pop appropriation but with a darker, creature-focused twist. The project sold out on primary. Each NFT could be redeemed for a physical, limited-edition print: 20×24 inches, Giclée on Hahnemühle German etching paper, embossed and hand-signed. The print option was time-limited; secondary buyers had a window to redeem before it closed. So you’re buying digital plus the possibility (or past) of a tangible object.

## Why It Matters

Monster Soup sits at the intersection of pop art, NFT editioning, and real-world redemption. The physical component mattered—collectors could hang something on the wall, not just own a token. Des Lucréce’s Monster motif is consistent across his work; this project packaged it in a recognisable, collectible format. The 100-variety × four-colour structure gave clear scarcity. For people who want “something real” with their NFT, Monster Soup was a concrete example.

## The Art

Soup cans. Monsters. Four palettes per design. Graphic, bold, slightly unsettling. The aesthetic is pop-meets-horror—familiar format, unfamiliar content. Each can is a distinct composition within that system.

## Notable Pieces

100 designs, four colours each. Sold out on primary; secondary on OpenSea. Print redemptions are over, but the NFTs remain. Rarity and demand depend on design and colour. Check secondary for current activity.

## Context for Collectors

Print redemption has ended. You’re buying the NFT only. Verify which design and colour you’re getting. The project has a dedicated collector base; liquidity depends on the market. Creator royalties may apply.

## Personal Take

Monster Soup is a tidy, concept-driven project with a real physical hook. The Warhol reference is obvious but not lazy—Des Lucréce makes it his own. If you like pop appropriation and redemption models, it’s worth knowing. Not a blue chip, but coherent and memorable.
