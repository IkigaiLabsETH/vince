# Beeple Genesis

OpenSea Slug: `beeple-genesis`

## The Artist

Beeple is Mike Winkelmann—digital artist, designer, and arguably the person who forced the traditional art world to take NFTs seriously. He’d been posting a new digital work every single day since May 2007, long before “NFT” was a buzzword. The Genesis piece is the Christie’s 1/1 that changed everything: **Everydays: The First 5000 Days**. A single composite image of 5,000 daily works, arranged chronologically. Political satire, sci‑fi, pop culture, abstraction—over a decade of output collapsed into one token. MakersPlace generated the NFT; Christie’s auctioned it. March 2021.

## Why It Matters

The $69.3M sale was a hinge moment. Christie’s first NFT auction. First time a major house accepted Ether. It made Beeple the third-most-expensive living artist at auction and reset how galleries, collectors, and normies thought about digital art. The buyer was MetaKovan (Vignesh Sundaresan), 42,329 ETH. Whether you think it was genius or a coordinated flex, it happened. The work itself is a document: 5,000 days of discipline, evolution, and internet-native visual language. You can dispute the aesthetic—plenty have—but you can’t dispute the impact.

## The Art

A massive digital collage. Each tile is one “Everyday”—varying style, subject, and finish. The whole reads as a single image but rewards zooming. Beeple’s signature mix: 3D, graphic design, meme sensibility, sometimes dark or absurd. The art lives as a high-res file; the NFT attests ownership and provenance. Beeple kept copyright; he gets royalties on secondary. Display rights went to the buyer.

## Notable Pieces

**Everydays: The First 5000 Days** — The one. $69,346,250 incl. premium. Christie’s, March 2021. The token that broke the record. Still the reference point when anyone asks “how much can an NFT go for?”

## Context for Collectors

Genesis is the 1/1. There’s no “floor”—there’s the work and whoever holds it. The Beeple ecosystem includes other drops (e.g. Everydays series, Crap, etc.), but Genesis is the icon. Controversy followed: MetaKovan’s B20 token, questions about the sale’s nature. None of that undoes the cultural fact. If you’re collecting “moments that defined NFTs,” Genesis is non-negotiable.

## Personal Take

Genesis is less interesting to me as a standalone image than as a cultural bomb. The sale did what it was supposed to do: it forced the conversation. From a pure art perspective, I’m more drawn to generative and on-chain work—but you don’t write the history of NFTs without Beeple and that Christie’s hammer. Overrated as art? Debatable. Underrated as a historical object? No. It earned its place.
