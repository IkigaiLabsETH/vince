## The Artist

Dmitri Cherniak is a Canadian artist and computer scientist. He’s been in generative art for years; Ringers dropped on Art Blocks in January 2021 and quickly became one of the platform’s flagship projects. The idea is simple: strings wrapped around pegs. The execution is not. The algorithm generates a huge variety of configurations—peg count, layout, wrap direction, colours—from that single constraint. Each output is driven by the token’s transaction hash, so what you get is unique and verifiable. Cherniak’s other work (including The Eternal Pump) explores similar ideas: simple rules, rich variation, clean code.

## Why It Matters

Ringers broke records. Ringers #879—“The Goose”—sold for $6.2M at Sotheby’s in June 2023, then one of the top generative art auction results ever. #109 had already gone for ~2,100 ETH (~$7.1M) in late 2021. The collection’s secondary volume is in the tens of thousands of ETH. It’s proof that algorithmic art can sit in the same room as traditional high art and hold its own.

It also matters technically. The string-and-peg concept is easy to grasp; the outputs feel like a shared visual language. That accessibility, plus the rigor of the algorithm, helped push “generative” into a broader collector base. LACMA acquired #962 as its first blockchain art piece. Ringers are now part of the canon.

## The Art

Strings wrapped around pegs. The algorithm varies peg count, size, arrangement, wrap direction, background, peg style, and string colour. From that you get an enormous range: sparse and minimal, dense and knotted, symmetric or chaotic. The aesthetic is geometric and precise—no loose brushstrokes, just clear formal decisions. Some read as optical illusions; others like abstract diagrams. All of them feel like one coherent system.

## Notable Pieces

**Ringers #879 (“The Goose”)** – Sold for $6.2M at Sotheby’s, June 2023. The name stuck; it’s the iconic Ringers sale.

**Ringers #109** – ~2,100 ETH (~$7.1M) in October 2021. One of the highest NFT sales of the era.

**Ringers #962** – Acquired by LACMA as the museum’s first blockchain art acquisition.

**Ringers #375** – Featured at Sotheby’s Contemporary Day Auction 2023.

Collectors pay up for rare peg counts, distinctive compositions, and historically significant numbers (#1, etc.). Total secondary volume north of 30,000 ETH.

## Context for Collectors

1,000 pieces. Art Blocks Curated. Supply is fixed. Floor has often sat in the single‑digit to low double‑digit ETH range; top pieces trade in a different league.

People collect Ringers for the algorithm, the auction pedigree, and the belief that Cherniak’s work will age well. Trait rarity exists but aesthetic preference matters as much—certain layouts and colour combos command premiums. Ownership and provenance are on-chain.

If you’re building an Art Blocks–centric collection, Ringers are essential. They’re expensive because the market has decided they’re foundational.

## Personal Take

Ringers deserve the hype. The concept is elegant, the outputs are strong, and the sales trajectory reflects real demand from both crypto-natives and traditional collectors. Cherniak didn’t need gimmicks—just a good idea, executed well.

Is it overrated? I don’t think so. The Goose sale was a moment. LACMA’s acquisition was another. Ringers sit alongside Fidenza and Squiggles as “you need to know this” generative art. If you’re deep in Art Blocks, you already do. If you’re not, Ringers are a good place to start understanding why people care.
