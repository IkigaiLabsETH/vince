# Sightseers

OpenSea Slug: `sightseers-by-norman-harman`

## The Artist

Norman Harman is a generative artist. Sightseers launched on Art Blocks in February 2023—1,111 pieces, mint price 0.333 ETH. The project was linked to initiatives like the byteGANs allowlist via SOVRN OPEN, aimed at emerging AI and generative artists. Harman’s work tends to sit at the intersection of algorithm and image; Sightseers fits that lane.

## Why It Matters

Sightseers arrived as a mid-supply Art Blocks project with a clear mint structure and community hooks. The byteGANs tie-in highlighted support for newer artists. It’s not a platform-defining drop, but it’s a solid entry in the “generative art on Art Blocks” catalogue. Collectors who track Curated and adjacent drops know it.

## The Art

Generative outputs driven by the token hash. The aesthetic varies by seed; the project name suggests travel, place, observation. For specifics, check the Art Blocks project page and secondary market examples—layout, palette, and composition differ piece to piece.

## Notable Pieces

1,111 supply. Secondary activity and floor depend on market conditions. Early mints and visually strong outputs typically command more. Trait rarity exists but isn’t as dominant as in PFPs.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks. Fixed supply. If you’re building a broad generative art set, Sightseers is a reasonable inclusion. Look at a range of outputs before buying; preference is largely aesthetic.

## Personal Take

Sightseers is a steady, unflashy Art Blocks project. It won’t grab headlines like Ringers or Fidenza, but it has a clear identity and a defined supply. Worth knowing if you follow the platform; worth owning if you like Harman’s work or the byteGANs/SOVRN context.
