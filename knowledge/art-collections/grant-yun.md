# Grant Yun

OpenSea Slug: `grant-yun`

## The Artist

Grant Yun—Milwaukee-based digital artist. He works on a MacBook trackpad in Illustrator, building images from vector shapes “like a puzzle.” He coined “Neo-Precisionism”: sharp lines, geometric form, early-20th-century Precisionism meets digital. The work explores philosophical and religious themes; he sees it as the future of digital art in Web3. His art has appeared at Sotheby’s, Christie’s, and in PROOF’s Grails. Key 1/1s live on SuperRare and OpenSea (“Citrus,” “Twilight in the Tetons,” “Starry Night Over Sausalito”). “Life in Japan” dropped on Solana (Exchange.art, 250 editions). The “grant-yun” slug often groups his work across platforms.

## Why It Matters

Grant Yun proved that hyperrealistic, precisionist digital art could hold its own in NFTs. The trackpad-to-vector process and the Neo-Precisionist frame gave him a clear identity. Auctions and Grails placement validated him. For collectors who care about illustration, geometry, and “digital painting,” Yun is a reference. The work is accessible but rigorous.

## The Art

Neo-Precisionist. Sharp geometry, minimal palette, often monochrome or limited colour. Landscapes, still lifes, architectural elements. The aesthetic is clean, deliberate, almost graphic-design-adjacent. Check his platforms for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

1/1s and editions. “Citrus,” “Twilight in the Tetons,” “Starry Night Over Sausalito,” “Life in Japan.” Auction and Grails results support demand. Check OpenSea, SuperRare, Exchange.art for structure.

## Context for Collectors

Yun is multi-platform (Ethereum, Solana). Verify which collection or piece you’re buying. You’re buying the artist and the aesthetic. Liquidity varies by piece.

## Personal Take

Grant Yun is a serious digital artist. Neo-Precisionism gives him a hook; the execution backs it up. Underrated in PFP-heavy discourse. Essential for “digital painting” and precisionist NFT art.
