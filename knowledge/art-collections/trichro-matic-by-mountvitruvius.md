# Trichro-matic

OpenSea Slug: `trichro-matic-by-mountvitruvius`

## The Artist

MountVitruvius again. Trichro-matic is on Art Blocks Curated. The name plays on “trichromatic” (perceiving three primary colours) and “-omatic” (machinery, systems). The work “meditates on perception”: rhythm, colour, form, displacement, juxtaposition. Elements shift as you look—flat becomes deep, adjacent forms occlude each other. Depth and reading are unstable. Palettes mix hand-picked and algorithmic choice. MountVitruvius has said it’s his most technically complex release, using custom GPU rendering that’s computationally heavy even when outputs look simple. He dedicated it to his father, who lost vision after a stroke in September 2023. Physical prints are available for holders.

## Why It Matters

Trichro-matic ties perception, memory, and loss to generative form. The technical ambition (GPU, custom pipeline) and the emotional dedication make it more than a formal exercise. It’s done over 1,300 ETH in volume, with a committed holder base and low listing rates. The project pushes what “generative” can do on Art Blocks—both visually and conceptually. For MountVitruvius collectors, it’s a flagship.

## The Art

Geometric, rhythmic, colour-forward. Forms that seem to shift—depth, overlap, occlusion. The “trichro” idea surfaces in the palette logic. Outputs range from minimal to dense. The aesthetic is precise and optical; you’re meant to look twice.

## Notable Pieces

Supply is fixed (Art Blocks Curated). Floor has often been around 0.27–0.3 ETH. Certain palettes and compositions trade higher. The print option adds a physical dimension. Check the Art Blocks project page and OpenSea for structure and activity.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify supply and contract. The print offer is holder-specific; confirm current terms. If you collect MountVitruvius or perception-driven generative art, Trichro-matic is essential.

## Personal Take

Trichro-matic is MountVitruvius at his best: technically ambitious and emotionally grounded. The dedication to his father adds weight without overshadowing the work. It deserves more attention in “best of Art Blocks” conversations. Not overrated.
