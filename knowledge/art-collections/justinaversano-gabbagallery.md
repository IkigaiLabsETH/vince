# Justin Aversano — Gabba Gallery

OpenSea Slug: `justinaversano-gabbagallery`

## The Artist

Justin Aversano (b. 1992) is an American artist and portrait photographer who helped put photography on the NFT map. His Twin Flames series—100 twin portraits exploring kinship and identity—started as physical work in 2018 and became NFTs in February 2021. It’s one of the earliest major photography projects on-chain. Twin Flames #83 sold for $1.1M at Christie’s in October 2021; the series has done thousands of ETH in volume. He’s since done Smoke & Mirrors (tarot-inspired, 78 silkscreen-on-papyrus portraits, Gabba Gallery LA), plus polaroids, cyanotypes, and other analog processes alongside NFT drops. Gabba Gallery is his LA space (e.g. 3126 Beverly Blvd); the “gabbagallery” slug often groups his gallery-associated work and drops.

## Why It Matters

Aversano showed that photography could hold its own in NFTs—not as a side note, but as a primary medium. Twin Flames is the proof. The Gabba Gallery shows (Smoke & Mirrors, etc.) and related NFT releases extend that: physical exhibitions, limited editions, then on-chain. He bridges analog and digital, portrait and concept. For anyone collecting photography NFTs, he’s essential. The Gabba connection ties NFTs to a real place and program.

## The Art

Photography. Portrait-focused—twins, tarot figures, identity. Traditional techniques (silkscreen, polaroid, cyanotype) plus NFT editioning. The aesthetic is fine-art photography: considered, symbolic, sometimes mystical. Each series has its own look; Twin Flames and Smoke & Mirrors are the anchors.

## Notable Pieces

**Twin Flames #83** – $1.1M at Christie’s. The flagship sale.

**Twin Flames** – 100 pieces, 6K+ ETH total volume. The core set.

**Smoke & Mirrors** – 78 works, Gabba debut, sold out on OpenSea. Tarot on papyrus.

Gabba-associated drops may use the justinaversano-gabbagallery slug; verify which specific collection you’re buying.

## Context for Collectors

Twin Flames trades on its own collection (e.g. twinflames); Gabba-related work may be under different slugs. Confirm artist, series, and contract. Photography NFT liquidity can be thinner than PFP; you’re often buying the artist and the image.

## Personal Take

Aversano is a pioneer of photography NFTs. Twin Flames deserves its place in the canon. The Gabba work extends the practice without diluting it. If you collect photo NFTs, he’s non-negotiable. Not overrated—correctly recognised.
