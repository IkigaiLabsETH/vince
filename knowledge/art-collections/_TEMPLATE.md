# Collection Name

OpenSea Slug: `collection-slug`

## The Artist

[Who made this? Their background, influences, other notable work. Write it like you're introducing them to a friend who hasn't heard of them.]

## Why It Matters

[What makes this collection significant? Be specific about the innovation, the moment it captured, or why collectors care. This is your take, not marketing copy.]

## The Art

[What does the work actually look like? What's the aesthetic? For generative projects: what's the algorithm doing? For photography/1-1s: what's the visual language?]

## Notable Pieces

[If there are specific pieces worth calling out, mention them. The rare traits, the grails, the ones that sold for big numbers and why.]

## Context for Collectors

[What should someone know before collecting this? What makes certain pieces more desirable? Any gotchas or things to watch for?]

## Personal Take

[Your honest opinion. Is it good? Overrated? Underrated? What do you think the future holds?]
