OpenSea Slug: `moonbirds`

## The Artist

PROOF Collective—Kevin Rose (Digg, early Web3) and team. Moonbirds launched April 2022: 10,000 pixelated owl PFPs. PROOF’s thesis: “Art is proof of our collective humanity.” The collection followed Grails and became PROOF’s flagship PFP. Owls wear witch hats, monocles, astronaut helmets. Holders get PROOF Discord, Parliament, drops, IRL events. “Nesting” locked Birds in-wallet to accrue benefits and tier upgrades. The art was later released CC0; Yuga now holds broader IP, though holders keep rights to derivatives they create while owning. Moonbirds traded at six figures early, then fell sharply in the crash—one of the defining “blue chip that got hit” stories.

## Why It Matters

Moonbirds proved that a collector-focused brand (PROOF) could launch a major PFP. The nesting mechanic and the tie to PROOF access created stickiness. Kevin Rose’s name brought credibility. The CC0 move and the Yuga IP deal later complicated the story. The project remains a reference for “2022 PFP mania” and “bear market reckoning.” For anyone tracking PROOF, Kevin Rose, or PFP boom–bust, Moonbirds is essential.

## The Art

Pixel owls. Cute, trait-driven, slightly retro. Accessories and backgrounds vary. The style is clean and recognisable. It’s PFP art—identity and membership first.

## Notable Pieces

10,000 supply. Rare traits and early IDs command premiums. Floor and volume have dropped from peaks. Check OpenSea for structure. PROOF drops and Mythics can affect sentiment.

## Context for Collectors

You’re buying PROOF access and the Moonbirds brand. The collection is sometimes referred to as "proof-moonbirds"; we use the slug `moonbirds` (same project). CC0 and Yuga IP mean legal nuance—verify current terms. Nesting is a mechanic; understand it before locking. Liquidity exists but has cooled. This is “community + PFP” as much as “art.”

## Personal Take

Moonbirds captured 2022 PFP hype and then the crash. The project isn’t dead—it’s just no longer untouchable. I’d rank it as “essential for PROOF and 2022 narrative” but not as a timeless art object. Not overrated at peak; possibly overrated in hindsight. Worth knowing.
