# Neural Sediments

OpenSea Slug: `neural-sediments-by-eko33`

## The Artist

Eko33 is Jean-Jacques Duclaux, a French generative artist with three decades of work bridging traditional and digital practice. He’s been experimenting with digital art since 1999 (including early work on a Commodore SX-64) and has shown at Seoul Museum of Art’s Media Art Biennial, Art Basel Miami, Venice Biennale, and Art Basel. His process combines hand-coded algorithms, custom AI trained on his own generative series, and vintage hardware. References run to mid-century design, environmental themes, and artists like Alberto Burri and František Kupka. Neural Sediments landed on Art Blocks Presents in 2023.

## Why It Matters

Neural Sediments uses algorithmically generated colour and form to confront viewers with their own biases. It’s immersive and conceptually pointed—not just “pretty code.” Eko33’s long career and institutional presence give it a different kind of weight than most NFT-native drops. The project fits his interest in systems, perception, and the boundary between human and machine. For collectors who care about generative art with a fine-art pedigree, Neural Sediments is a serious pick.

## The Art

Generative. Colour fields, organic and geometric form. The “sediments” idea suggests layering, accumulation, drift. Outputs vary by seed; the overall feel is contemplative and structured. Check the Art Blocks project page for exact behaviour. Eko33’s work is also on SuperRare, Foundation, fx(hash), Objkt, and Solana.

## Notable Pieces

Supply and structure depend on the Art Blocks release. Secondary activity on OpenSea. Eko33’s name and institutional history support demand. Certain seeds and palettes will attract premiums.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Presents. Verify supply and contract. If you collect generative art with a strong conceptual or art-world lineage, Neural Sediments belongs on the list. Eko33’s multichain presence means other work may live elsewhere.

## Personal Take

Neural Sediments is underrated in typical “Art Blocks canon” discussions. Eko33’s résumé and the bias/perception angle make it more than a vibes project. Worth a close look if you like generative art that engages with how we see and judge.
