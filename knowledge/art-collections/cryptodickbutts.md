# CryptoDickbutts

OpenSea Slug: `cryptodickbutts`

## The Artist

CryptoDickbutts is a deliberately absurdist NFT collection. The creators are pseudonymous; the project openly frames itself as “all seemingly about having a laugh.” The backstory is minimal: “Once a utopia, Gooch Island has fallen and CryptoDickbutts have been evacuated.” The site is intentionally low-fi—famously described as something you’d pay a junior designer fifty bucks on Fiverr to make. There’s no utility, no roadmap, no serious pretence. And yet pieces have sold for real money. CryptoDickbutt #181 went for 2.9 ETH. BlackRock’s Ethereum fund wallet has been spotted holding CryptoDickbutts and meme coins. The project has become a reference point for “NFTs at their most ridiculous.”

## Why It Matters

CryptoDickbutts matters precisely because it doesn’t take itself seriously. It’s a Rorschach test: either you think it’s funny and slightly profound (meme as value, absurdity as culture) or you think it’s proof that NFTs are a greater-fool circus. Critics use it as a punchline; believers use it as a badge. The market has spoken—people buy and hold. It’s in the “cultural artifact” bucket whether you like it or not. You can’t tell the story of 2021–2022 NFTs without it.

## The Art

Phallic-themed, cartoonish, meme-native. The aesthetic is deliberately crude. Trait variety exists but the point isn’t rarity optimisation—it’s the joke. Each piece is a Dickbutt variant. You know what you’re getting.

## Notable Pieces

#181 sold for 2.9 ETH. Other sales have occurred. The “grail” is whatever the community decides is the funniest or most iconic. BlackRock’s inadvertent embrace added a layer of meme lore.

## Context for Collectors

You’re buying a joke with a market. There’s no utility, no roadmap. Condition is irrelevant; provenance is the chain. If you’re in it for lolz or as a tradeable meme, you know what you’re doing. If you’re in it for “art,” you’re either trolling or you have a very specific definition.

## Personal Take

CryptoDickbutts is what it is. It’s not overrated—it never pretended to be high art. It’s underrated as *culture*. Love it or hate it, it’s part of the NFT story. I wouldn’t put it in a “greatest art collections” list, but I’d put it in a “you need to know this exists” list. Collect at your own risk and sense of humour.
