# Urban Transportation: Red Trucks

OpenSea Slug: `urban-transportation-red-trucks`

## The Artist

The collection centres on urban transportation and red trucks as a documentary and aesthetic motif. Photographers and artists have long used transit—taxis, buses, trucks—to capture city life, labour, and colour. Red trucks in particular read as strong graphic elements: bold, industrial, sometimes vintage. The project fits into a broader tradition of urban and transportation photography in NFTs (e.g. Alejandro Cartagena’s carpoolers, NYC365, transit-themed collections). The exact artist and platform can vary by slug and marketplace; verify the specific contract and creator.

## Why It Matters

Urban transportation NFTs document infrastructure, work, and place. Red trucks add a clear visual anchor—colour, form, context. For collectors who care about documentary photography, street photography, or city-as-subject, transportation-focused projects offer a distinct niche. They’re often under the radar compared to PFPs or headline generative art, but they hold a clear conceptual lane.

## The Art

Photography. Urban scenes, trucks, transit. Red as a recurring element. Style can range from straight documentary to more composed or cinematic. Verify individual pieces for tone and format.

## Notable Pieces

Supply, structure, and secondary activity depend on the specific collection. Check OpenSea and project pages for the exact “urban-transportation-red-trucks” contract, edition sizes, and market data.

## Context for Collectors

Confirm you’re buying the intended collection—slugs can overlap with broader “urban” or “transport” sets. Photography NFT liquidity is often thinner than PFP or generative. You’re often buying the image and the theme more than flipped utility.

## Personal Take

Urban transportation–focused NFT photography is a solid “documentary + art” corner. Red trucks give it a clear hook. If you like street or transit photography, it’s worth tracking. Niche but coherent.
