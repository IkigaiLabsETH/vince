# ripcache

OpenSea Slug: `ripcache`

## The Artist

Ripcache is a digital artist who focuses on fully on-chain and animated NFT work. Themes run to surveillance, data, and digital aesthetics. He’s released multiple collections: Pattern Recognition (1/1/64, fully on-chain), Dronekiller, Birds, Public//Private, and others on SuperRare, Manifold, etc. His work has been in Christie’s Post-War and Contemporary Art Day Sale, Cozomo de’ Medici’s “12 Most Iconic Artworks of 2023,” NFT Now’s NFT 100, and physical shows (e.g. “Metal Metamorphosis” with HR Giger in Paris). He’s well respected in the on-chain art community.

## Why It Matters

Ripcache is a reference point for “fully on-chain” as a practice. No IPFS thumbnails, no off-chain renders—the art lives in the contract. Pattern Recognition and similar projects push that further. The institutional and curator recognition (Christie’s, Cozomo, NFT 100) has cemented him as a serious artist in the space. If you care about on-chain purity and conceptual clarity, his work matters.

## The Art

Varies by project. Pattern Recognition and related work often lean into data viz, glitch, and systematic abstraction. Surveillance and systems show up repeatedly. The technical constraint—everything on-chain—shapes the aesthetic: efficient, precise, sometimes minimal. Animation when applicable.

## Notable Pieces

Pattern Recognition and other 1/1 or small-edition drops have traded at meaningful levels. Cozomo’s “12 Most Iconic” inclusion and Christie’s presence signal institutional interest. Check OpenSea and project-specific pages for current activity.

## Context for Collectors

“ripcache” as a slug can point to the artist’s body of work or specific collections (e.g. Pattern Recognition). Verify which contract or set you’re buying. His work appeals to on-chain purists and collectors who care about technical and conceptual rigor.

## Personal Take

Ripcache is one of the artists I’d point to when someone asks “who’s doing interesting fully on-chain work?” The Christie’s and Cozomo nods are earned. Not every piece will suit every taste, but the project is coherent and historically relevant. Worth following.
