# Life and Love and Nothing

OpenSea Slug: `life-and-love-and-nothing-by-nat-sarkissian`

## The Artist

Nat Sarkissian is a generative artist focused on impressionistic, abstract, and simulated systems—representational work, geometry, light, colour. He has other Art Blocks projects: Sunset from the Bluffs (100), Never the Same (200). Life and Love and Nothing dropped on Art Blocks Presents in October 2023: 200 pieces. The title suggests the big themes—existence, connection, absence—without spelling them out. His work tends to be atmospheric and considered rather than noisy or flashy.

## Why It Matters

Life and Love and Nothing is a small, focused Presents project. 200 supply means each output carries weight. The title invites reflection; the aesthetic supports it. Sarkissian’s reputation and the “life / love / nothing” frame make it a “collect the artist” and “collect the mood” play. It hasn’t had Fidenza-level volume, but it has a dedicated following. For anyone building a thoughtful generative-art set, it’s a solid inclusion.

## The Art

Generative. Likely impressionistic, abstract—light, colour, soft form. Check the Art Blocks project page for exact behaviour. The vibe is contemplative rather than chaotic. Palettes and composition probably vary widely within a coherent system.

## Notable Pieces

200 supply. Art Blocks Presents. Secondary activity and floor depend on Sarkissian’s market and broader Presents demand. Early mints and strong compositions typically trade higher.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Presents. 200 fixed. If you like Sarkissian or meditative generative work, Life and Love and Nothing fits. Verify project page and contract.

## Personal Take

Life and Love and Nothing is a quiet, serious project. The title does a lot of work—you bring your own reading. Sarkissian’s practice supports it. Underrated next to bigger Curated drops. Worth a look.
