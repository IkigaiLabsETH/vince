# 100 Sunsets

OpenSea Slug: `100-sunsets-by-zach-lieberman`

## The Artist

Zach Lieberman is a New York–based artist, educator, and programmer. He co-created openFrameworks and co-founded the School for Poetic Computation. His work connects gesture, interaction, and code—installations, performances, tools. He’s been in creative coding for years. 100 Sunsets landed on Art Blocks via Bright Moments. The project bottles “sunset” into 100 generative moments: colour, light, transition. Lieberman’s practice often finds the human in the algorithmic; 100 Sunsets fits that.

## Why It Matters

100 Sunsets is Lieberman doing generative art with a clear, universal hook. Everyone knows a sunset; the algorithm varies the experience. Bright Moments’ IRL/community layer adds context. The small supply (100) and the artist’s reputation make it a serious collectible. Floor has often sat around 2 ETH; individual pieces have traded in the 2–2.5 ETH range. It’s a reference point for “artist-led, small-edition” Art Blocks work.

## The Art

Generative sunsets. Colour gradients, light, maybe motion or transition. The aesthetic is likely warm, atmospheric, and recognisably “sunset” while still abstract. Check the Art Blocks / Bright Moments project page for exact outputs. Lieberman’s touch tends toward clarity and emotion over noise.

## Notable Pieces

100 supply. Each piece is a distinct “sunset.” Secondary favours early mints and visually striking outputs. Floor and volume track Lieberman’s market and Bright Moments demand.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks, Bright Moments. 100 fixed. If you collect Lieberman or poetic/computational art, 100 Sunsets is essential. Verify contract and platform.

## Personal Take

100 Sunsets is one of those projects that feels both simple and deep. The constraint is clear; the execution matters. Lieberman’s name and the tiny supply justify the premium. Not overrated. If you like generative art with a human, almost nostalgic feel, it’s a must-know.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs
