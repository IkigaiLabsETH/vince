# Meridian

OpenSea Slug: `meridian-by-matt-deslauriers`

## The Artist

Matt DesLauriers is a generative artist and creative coder. He’s done games, tools, and art; his work tends to be technically crisp and visually clear. Meridian landed on Art Blocks in September 2021. He’s also behind Subscapes and other projects. He’s been generous with process—blog posts, high-res export tools, interactive playgrounds—so collectors can go deep on how the work is made. That openness is part of the project’s identity.

## Why It Matters

Meridian showed that generative art could feel like *landscape* without being literal. Topographic strata, built from hundreds of thousands of small colour strokes—it reads as terrain, horizon, depth. The algorithm is a ~15kb JavaScript program; each token’s hash maps to a point in a high-dimensional generative space. The result is a thousand distinct “places,” all from one system.

It also matters that DesLauriers made the outputs usable. Token holders can export high-res files for prints; there’s an open playground to explore the algorithm. The value isn’t locked in a black box. That shifted how some people think about generative NFT art—ownership of the token vs. access to the output.

## The Art

Layered, stratified landforms. You see contour-like bands of colour, shifting hue and density. Some pieces feel like mountains at golden hour; others like abstract cross-sections. The stroke-based construction gives texture rather than smooth gradients. Palette and composition vary widely—serene, dramatic, minimal, busy. It’s all clearly the same family.

## Notable Pieces

**Meridian #943** – Offered at Sotheby’s Digital Art Day Sale, April 2024, estimate $8K–$12K. Solid auction representation.

The collection has traded in the thousands of ETH total volume; floor has often been in the low single‑digit ETH range. Certain colour schemes and compositions trade at a premium. DesLauriers has discussed token-limited signed prints and open-edition unsigned prints for select outputs, which adds another dimension for collectors.

## Context for Collectors

1,000 pieces. Art Blocks. Supply fixed. Strong holder base—hundreds of unique owners—and decent liquidity for a Curated project.

People collect Meridian for the aesthetic, the “landscape without photograph” idea, and the artist’s transparency. It’s a good fit if you like topography, colour fields, and clear technical execution. Check the Art Blocks site and meridian.mattdesl.com for exploration and export tools.

## Personal Take

Meridian holds up. The aesthetic is distinctive, the system is elegant, and DesLauriers’ willingness to share process and enable prints makes it feel like a lasting project rather than a one-off drop. It’s not as headline-grabbing as Ringers or Fidenza, but it’s consistently respected.

I’d put it in the “should know” tier of Art Blocks. Not overrated—if anything, a bit under the radar next to the record-setters. If you like generative landscapes and thoughtful tooling, Meridian is worth a close look.
