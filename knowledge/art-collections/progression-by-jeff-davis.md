# Progression

OpenSea Slug: `progression-by-jeff-davis`

## The Artist

Jeff Davis (b. 1972) is a generative artist and Strategic Advisor to Art Blocks. He’s been making abstract work with algorithms for years—geometry, colour, sequence. He’s exhibited with Bright Moments in Tokyo, Mexico City, London, Berlin, NYC, LA, and his work has appeared at Sotheby’s, Phillips, and the Venice European Cultural Center. On Art Blocks he’s done Framework, Construction Token, Reflection, Neighborhood, and others. Progression landed on Art Blocks Studio in March 2025. He’s firmly in the “artist-first, platform-second” camp: the work drives the medium.

## Why It Matters

Progression explores “the visual effects of colours in sequence.” It’s a colour-and-structure project—how order and progression create meaning. The collection sold out at release; 50% of proceeds went to the Generative Art Foundation. That’s a signal: artist and platform both putting weight behind institutional support for the field.

Davis has long been adjacent to the Art Blocks ecosystem. Progression is him planting a flag directly on the platform. For anyone tracking “serious” generative art—museum-adjacent, foundation-backed—Progression is part of that conversation.

## The Art

Abstract. Colour progressions, geometric arrangements. The algorithm produces 777 unique outputs; each is driven by the token’s parameters. The emphasis is on sequence and relationship—how one hue or form leads to the next. The aesthetic is clean and contemplative, more gallery than meme. No narrative imagery; pure structure and colour.

## Notable Pieces

777 pieces. Recent release (2025), so the secondary market is still forming. Sell-out at mint and the GAF donation gave it immediate credibility. Expect certain progressions and colour schemes to become favourites over time; it’s early for a definitive “grail” list.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Studio. 777 supply. Fixed. If you collect Davis already, Progression is a core piece of his Art Blocks presence. If you care about the Generative Art Foundation and where grant money goes, the 50% donation is part of the story. Aesthetic-wise, it suits anyone who likes refined, sequential abstraction.

## Personal Take

Progression feels like a mature artist making a clear statement on Art Blocks. It’s not trying to break the internet; it’s trying to add a coherent, colour-focused project to the canon. The GAF tie-in matters for the ecosystem.

Too early to call it over- or underrated. I’d treat it as a “watch” project: strong artist, clear concept, institutional links. If you like Jeff Davis or colour-field generative art, it’s worth owning. If you’re only in for flip potential, you’re looking at the wrong collection.
