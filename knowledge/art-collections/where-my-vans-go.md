# Where My Vans Go

OpenSea Slug: `where-my-vans-go`

## The Artist

Isaac Wright—DrifterShoots. Former paratrooper, urban explorer, photographer. He climbs buildings, cranes, bridges and shoots from dangerous heights. The work started as escape and healing; he’s talked about PTSD, depression, and finding “humility, wonder, and love” up there. Where My Vans Go launched August 2021: 131 NFTs. Houston, New York, forbidden rooftops and structures. The project migrated to his own Manifold contract. Proceeds support his non-profit (bail relief, reentry). His arrest story made the front page of the New York Times (June 2021).

## Why It Matters

Where My Vans Go is one of the highest-selling photography NFT projects. Floor has often sat around 2 ETH; total volume in the thousands of ETH. Wright proved that documentary, risk, and story could hold their own in a PFP-dominated market. The imagery is literal—edges, drops, cityscape—but the _why_ (veteran, healing, defiance) gives it weight. For collectors who care about photography NFTs and narrative, it’s essential.

## The Art

Urban exploration photography. Rooftops, cranes, bridges. Feet over void, city below. The aesthetic is raw, vertigo-inducing, sometimes triumphant. Each piece is a specific place and moment. The constraint is access and risk.

## Notable Pieces

131 supply. Individual pieces have sold in the 3–9 ETH range. Floor ~2 ETH. Check OpenSea and wheremyvansgo.com for structure. The collection is one of the most liquid photo NFT sets.

## Context for Collectors

131 fixed. Verify you’re on the canonical contract (Manifold). You’re buying the image and the story. Liquidity is strong for photography. Wright’s non-profit and his arc are part of the narrative.

## Personal Take

Where My Vans Go earned it. The work is visceral; the backstory matters. Wright didn’t just mint photos—he built a body of work and a cause. Not overrated. Essential for photo NFT collectors.
