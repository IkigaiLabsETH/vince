# The Eternal Pump

OpenSea Slug: `the-eternal-pump-by-dmitri-cherniak`

## The Artist

Dmitri Cherniak again. The Eternal Pump dropped 22 February 2021 on Art Blocks Presents: 50 pieces. JavaScript + GLSL. The project is often read as commentary on market cycles—pump, repetition, the “eternal” loop of crypto. Rings, walls, vibes (smooth/textured), view, palette, animation. 90% ring shapes, 82% smooth. Highest sale ~$1.6M. Cherniak’s later work (Ringers, The Wrapture) extends similar themes. We have Ringers; Eternal Pump is the smaller, earlier, mechanism-focused sibling.

## Why It Matters

The Eternal Pump showed that Cherniak could pack concept and mechanism into a tight edition. The 50 supply and the market-cycle reading made it a collector favourite. The formal clarity (rings, walls, motion) holds up. For Cherniak collectors, it’s a key early piece. The project proved that generative art could carry explicit commentary and still trade at serious levels.

## The Art

Generative. Rings, walls, limited perspective. Smooth or textured; palette and animation vary. The look is minimal, geometric, almost architectural. Check the Art Blocks project for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

50 supply. Secondary has been active; highest ~$1.6M. Certain configurations command premiums. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Presents. 50 fixed. If you collect Cherniak, Eternal Pump is essential. Supply is tiny. Verify project and contract.

## Personal Take

The Eternal Pump is Cherniak doing concept with constraint. The market-cycle angle lands for those who care. Not as headline as Ringers, but sharp. Underrated.
