# FVCKRENDER

OpenSea Slug: `fvckrender`

## The Artist

FVCKRENDER—self-taught digital artist from Vancouver. Crystalline, futuristic, hyper-idealised 3D work. He’s done FVCK_CRYSTAL// (4,169 NFTs, precious-stone imagery), client work for Supreme, Dior, Columbia, Spotify, and exhibitions (e.g. “Catch the Light,” W1 Curates London—immersive LED, meditative). His art touches anxiety, trauma, and emotional transformation through light and structure. Major sales on OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, SuperRare; Sotheby’s and Christie’s have featured him. The “fvckrender” slug often aggregates his output; FVCK_CRYSTAL// is a flagship collection.

## Why It Matters

FVCKRENDER proved that hyper-detailed 3D crystal art could scale in NFTs. The aesthetic is distinct—geometric, luminous, sometimes unsettling. The commercial work and the auction presence gave him crossover credibility. For collectors who care about 3D, crystal, and “digital sculpture,” FVCKRENDER is a reference. The “fvckrender” brand extends across drops and platforms.

## The Art

3D. Crystals, architecture, futuristic landscapes. Sharp geometry, refined lighting. The work ranges from static to animated. FVCK_CRYSTAL// ties that to stone and rarity. Check OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, fvckrender.xyz for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

FVCK_CRYSTAL//: 4,169 supply; holders get LVCIDIA// access, events, raffles. Other 1/1s and editions trade on various platforms. Check OpenSea and his NFT pages for structure.

## Context for Collectors

“Fvckrender” can mean the artist or specific collections (e.g. FVCK_CRYSTAL//). Verify what you’re buying. Multi-platform. You’re buying the artist and the aesthetic. Liquidity varies by piece.

## Personal Take

FVCKRENDER has a clear visual language. The crystal work is recognisable. Not overrated. Essential for 3D and crystal NFT art.
