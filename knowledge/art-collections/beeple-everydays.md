# Beeple Everydays

OpenSea Slug: `beeple-everydays`

## The Artist

Beeple (Mike Winkelmann) has been making and posting one new digital artwork every day since 1 May 2007. The Everydays project is the practice itself—thousands of pieces over more than a decade. No breaks. The output ranges from quick sketches to elaborate 3D scenes: political commentary, sci‑fi, gross-out humour, corporate satire, whatever the day demanded. The project predates NFTs; it became a pillar of the “digital art” narrative when the space exploded. Beeple also does commercial work (concert visuals, album art) and other NFT drops, but Everydays is the spine.

## Why It Matters

Everydays proved that sustained daily practice could translate into cultural and market impact. The discipline is the point—the body of work matters as much as any single image. When “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” sold at Christie’s for $69M, it wasn’t just one collage; it was 5,000 days of that practice commodified. The broader Everydays corpus lives on OpenSea and elsewhere as a mix of 1/1s and editions. Collectors aren’t just buying a JPEG; they’re buying into the streak, the lore, and the idea that consistency compounds.

## The Art

Highly variable. 3D renders, 2D illustration, typography, memes, abstract forms. The throughline is Beeple’s sensibility: sharp, often cynical, visually dense. Some pieces are粗糙 and throwaway; others are technically impressive. The “everyday” constraint means you get the full range—good, bad, weird. The collection as a whole is the artwork.

## Notable Pieces

**Everydays: The First 5000 Days** — The Christie’s 1/1 (see beeple-genesis). Other standout days have been minted or sold individually; the market tends to elevate specific dates or themes. Early Everydays (2007–2012) carry historical weight. Check secondary for structure and activity.

## Context for Collectors

The “beeple-everydays” slug can refer to the ongoing series, specific drops, or the broader corpus. Supply and format vary by drop. You’re buying Beeple’s practice as much as a discrete image. Liquidity and pricing depend on which piece and which platform. Verify what you’re buying.

## Personal Take

Everydays is more compelling as a project than as a set of individual images. The longevity and the habit are the story. I respect the grind; I’m not equally interested in every output. For collectors who care about digital-art history and “creator as institution,” Everydays belongs in the conversation. Not overrated as a phenomenon—possibly overrated piece by piece. Your mileage will vary.
