# Chromie Squiggle

OpenSea Slug: `chromie-squiggle-by-snowfro`

## The Artist

Snowfro is Erick Calderon—artist, tinkerer, founder of Art Blocks. He ran a ceramic tile company in Houston for nearly two decades before CryptoPunks sent him down the NFT rabbit hole. He built Art Blocks because he wanted a place where generative art could live *as* generative art: algorithm in, unique output out, no curator picking favourites. Chromie Squiggle, released in November 2020, was the first project on the platform. He’s called it “the soul of Art Blocks” and his personal signature. It’s the genesis. Everything else came after.

## Why It Matters

Squiggles *are* Art Blocks in distilled form. Simple idea—a single colourful squiggle—massive variation. They’re recognisable, shareable, and they proved that generative art could scale. MoMA acquired eight Squiggles (plus eight Punks) in late 2025. LACMA got Squiggles in the Cozomo de’ Medici donation and minted the final Squiggle into its collection in 2024. When institutions tell the story of on-chain art, Squiggles are in the first chapter.

They also built community. Squiggle DAO, collectors, derivatives—the project became a hub. It’s not just a set of images; it’s a reference point for a whole segment of NFT culture.

## The Art

One wavy line. Colours vary. The squiggle can be tight or loose, busy or spare. The algorithm produces 10,000 unique outputs; each is stored on-chain. On the Art Blocks site they’re interactive—click for colour animation, arrow keys for speed, spacebar for background. They’re intentionally simple. No elaborate scenery, no hidden complexity. The constraint is the point.

Roughly 9,200–9,700 were minted before public minting was paused; the rest were reserved for community and manual distribution. Supply is effectively fixed.

## Notable Pieces

**MoMA acquisition** – Eight Chromie Squiggles entered MoMA’s permanent collection in December 2025, alongside eight CryptoPunks.

**LACMA** – Squiggles included in the 22-piece Cozomo de’ Medici donation; the final Squiggle was minted directly to LACMA in August 2024.

**Secondary sales** – Notable trades in the 7–9 ETH range (e.g. #7676, #7654 in March 2022). Floor and volume have fluctuated with the market, but Squiggles consistently sit among the most traded Art Blocks projects.

## Context for Collectors

~10K possible, ~9.2K–9.7K in circulation. The rest are reserved. You’re buying history as much as image—genesis Art Blocks, Snowfro’s signature project, now in MoMA and LACMA.

People collect Squiggles for the narrative, the platform story, and the institutional validation. Trait-based rarity exists but matters less than “it’s a Squiggle.” Fairly liquid for generative art; good entry point if you want exposure to Art Blocks OGs without Fidenza/Ringers-level price tags.

## Personal Take

Squiggles are the friendly face of Art Blocks. They’re approachable, they’re iconic, and they’ve aged well. Snowfro made something that *looks* simple and *is* simple, and that’s why it works. No overdesign.

I don’t think they’re overrated. The museum acquisitions say everything. If you’re putting together a “foundational NFT art” set, Squiggles belong next to Punks, Autoglyphs, and a handful of Art Blocks heavy hitters. They’re not the fanciest algorithm, but they’re one of the most important.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the core thesis and its implications
- Evaluating risk/reward in context of current conditions
- Applying the framework to your own analysis

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
