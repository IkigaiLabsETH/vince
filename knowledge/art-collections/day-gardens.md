# Day Gardens

OpenSea Slug: `day-gardens`

## The Artist

Tyler Hobbs. Day Gardens dropped in June 2025 on Art Blocks: 51 generative pieces. Hobbs is the force behind Fidenza and QQL; Day Gardens is a smaller, more intimate project. The name suggests daylight, growth, cultivated space— gardens as subject and mood. The algorithm likely explores colour, form, and spatial arrangement within that frame. Supply is tight (51); the artist’s name alone drives substantial interest. Floor has often been around 4–4.5 ETH; volume over 100 ETH. 35 unique owners, ~69% of supply.

## Why It Matters

Day Gardens is Hobbs doing a small, focused run. No 999-piece scale, no QQL-style open mint—just 51 outputs. That scarcity and the “garden” concept create a distinct niche. For Hobbs collectors, it’s a must-have. For generative-art fans, it’s proof he can ship coherent work at different scales. The project hasn’t been around long, but the sell-out and secondary activity suggest it’s landing.

## The Art

Generative. Likely organic, colour-forward, “garden”-like—growth, light, arrangement. Hobbs’ touch tends toward flow and structure; expect something between Fidenza’s flow fields and something more botanical or landscape-adjacent. Check the Art Blocks project page for exact behaviour.

## Notable Pieces

51 supply. Each piece matters. Early mints and strong compositions will likely command premiums. Hobbs’ name supports floor and liquidity. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks for current activity.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks. 51 fixed. If you collect Hobbs, Day Gardens is core. Supply is tiny; entry is relatively expensive. Verify project page and contract.

## Personal Take

Day Gardens is Hobbs in “small and precious” mode. The constraint works. It’s early to call it over- or underrated, but it’s already a serious collectible. If you like Fidenza or QQL, it belongs on your radar.
