# Opepen Edition

OpenSea Slug: `opepen-edition`

## The Artist

Jack Butcher—Visualize Value founder, ex-ad strategist, creator of Checks and Opepen. He’s known for minimal, high-concept work: black and white, clear ideas, “make it easier to learn, teach, build, sell.” Opepen Edition launched in 2023: 16,000 pieces that mash Pepe meme culture with community-driven art. Collectors opt into different drops and influence how their NFTs reveal. Butcher has released multiple artist sets—e.g. “8x8,” “Brought to Light,” “Checkmate”—so Opepen functions as a platform as much as a single image set. It’s Pepe through a Visualize Value lens.

## Why It Matters

Opepen turned a meme into a programmable canvas. The opt-in drops and collector-driven reveals make it participatory. Butcher’s aesthetic (minimal, purposeful) contrasts with typical Pepe chaos—that tension is the point. The scale (16K) and the ongoing artist sets keep it alive. Opepen Edition is often cited alongside Checks as proof that Butcher can ship culture as much as graphics. The “Opepen” character has become a recurring motif in his universe.

## The Art

It varies by set and drop. Reinterpretations of Pepe—sometimes stripped down, sometimes layered with Butcher’s geometric and typographic language. Artist sets introduce new visual rules. The overall vibe is meme-native but deliberately designed.

## Notable Pieces

16,000 supply. Drops and artist sets create subsets (e.g. 8x8, Checkmate). Rarity and demand depend on set, edition, and reveal. Butcher’s name and the ongoing program support secondary interest. Check opepen.art and OpenSea for current structure.

## Context for Collectors

Opepen is actively evolving. New drops and sets change the composition of the project. Understand which edition or set you’re buying. The community and the “opt-in” mechanic are part of the value. Verify contract and drop rules.

## Personal Take

Opepen is Butcher doing “meme as system.” The 16K scale and the artist-set model make it more than a one-off. If you like Checks or Visualize Value, Opepen is a core piece. Not overrated—it’s meme culture filtered through a precise design sensibility.
