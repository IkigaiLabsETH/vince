# Incomplete Control

OpenSea Slug: `incomplete-control-by-tyler-hobbs`

## The Artist

Tyler Hobbs again. Incomplete Control dropped December 2021 on Art Blocks: 100 pieces, minted over four days at Bright Moments NYC. The project explores *imperfection* in digital art—contrasting algorithm precision with the warmth and flaw of analog mark-making. Hobbs wanted to “give up control” and let the algorithm define “an entire space of potential existence.” The result: brushstroke-like gestures, organic flow, often compared to Cy Twombly. No trait metadata; Hobbs felt categories would reduce the emergent balance, harmony, and rhythm. The collection sold out for ~$7M.

## Why It Matters

Incomplete Control is Hobbs doing “human” inside the machine. Post-Fidenza, he pushed toward analog feel—layered complexity, purposeful imperfection. The 100-piece cap and the Bright Moments mint made it an event. For Hobbs collectors, it’s a key pivot: less flow-field, more gesture. The project proved that generative art could carry the texture of hand work without losing algorithmic rigor.

## The Art

Generative brushstrokes. Organic, flowing marks—pencil-like, paint-like. The algorithm introduces “flaws” that follow patterns and probabilities. Palette and density vary. The look is contemplative, abstract, gestural. Check the Art Blocks project page for the full range.

## Notable Pieces

100 supply. No traits—collectors choose by eye. Secondary activity and floor track Hobbs’ market. Certain compositions command premiums. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks, Bright Moments. 100 fixed. If you collect Hobbs, Incomplete Control is essential. Supply is tiny; entry is relatively expensive. Verify project and contract.

## Personal Take

Incomplete Control is Hobbs at his most introspective. The constraint (imperfection, no traits) works. It’s not as iconic as Fidenza, but it’s a serious project. Underrated next to his flow-field work. Worth a look.
