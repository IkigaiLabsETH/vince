# Ignition

OpenSea Slug: `ignition-by-ge1doot`

## The Artist

ge1doot. Ignition is an Art Blocks Curated project from 2020. It was **lot 8** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks. The project uses traits such as hue, cube count, laser effects, and fractal subdivisions. The name suggests ignition as launch or transformation; the output is algorithmic and generative.

## Why It Matters

Ignition belongs to the canonical Natively Digital set. That sale marked generative art’s entry into major auctions; every project in the lot shares that legacy. It’s less discussed than Chromie Squiggle or Ringers but historically part of the same moment.

## The Art

Generative. Cubes, lasers, fractal elements. Hue and structure vary by seed. The look is likely geometric, often kinetic or light-oriented. Check Art Blocks and OpenSea for traits and range.

## Notable Pieces

Art Blocks Curated. Supply fixed. Check secondary for activity. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Important for Natively Digital completeness.

## Personal Take

Ignition is a supporting piece of the 2021 story—underrated but part of the set.
