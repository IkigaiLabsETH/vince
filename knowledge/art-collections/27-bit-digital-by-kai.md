# 27-Bit Digital

OpenSea Slug: `27-bit-digital-by-kai`

## The Artist

kai. 27-Bit Digital dropped on Art Blocks Curated 19 February 2021: 1,024 pieces. The project uses only **27 bits** of information—8‑bit colour plus 7‑segment LED–style display—as a tribute to digital heritage. Each piece is rendered entirely in code. Traits include Black & White, Glyph (e.g. Glitch, Ghost), Pattern, Resolution (often VGA 16×16). The project was **lot 14** in Sotheby’s **Natively Digital** sale (June 2021)—one of the 19 Art Blocks.

## Why It Matters

27-Bit Digital is part of the foundational Natively Digital set. The 27‑bit constraint is a clear conceptual hook: minimal information, maximum structure. It showed that Art Blocks could host constraint-driven, almost nostalgic digital work. The code is on GitHub (kaigani/artblocks-27-bit-digital), which adds transparency and appeal for creative coders.

## The Art

Generative. 8‑bit colour, 7‑segment–inspired forms. Lo-fi, systematic, occasionally glitchy. Traits shape glyph, pattern, and resolution. The look is deliberately low‑fi and digital-native.

## Notable Pieces

1,024 supply. Floor has often sat around ~0.07 ETH. Certain traits trade higher. Check OpenSea and Art Blocks. The Sotheby’s 2021 token was one of the 19.

## Context for Collectors

Art Blocks Curated. Verify project and contract. Open-source code available. Essential for Natively Digital and constraint-based generative art.

## Personal Take

27-Bit Digital is a sharp, underrated project. The constraint does real work. Worth a look for collectors who care about concept and digital heritage.
