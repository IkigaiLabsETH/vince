# Pop Wonder (SuperRare)

OpenSea Slug: `pop-wonder-superrare`

## The Artist

Pop Wonder is the artist. On SuperRare (@popwonder) they release 1/1 NFTs—single-edition works distinct from the higher-supply Pop Wonder Editions on OpenSea. Pop Wonder’s practice spans “Life Death & Cryptoart,” pop appropriation, and collaborations (e.g. VeeFriends, Puma). They’re on Ethereum, Base, Tezos, Polygon, and Bitcoin, with a hub at popwonder.art. Pop Wonder Perks and other drops tie into “Pop Wonder World.” The SuperRare slice is the 1/1, gallery-style layer.

## Why It Matters

Pop Wonder SuperRare is the premium, single-edition arm of the brand. Editions gave scale and accessibility; SuperRare gives scarcity and “art” positioning. The 1/1s tend to be the most visible in auctions and high-end collecting. If you’re building a Pop Wonder–centric set, the SuperRare work is the flagship tier. The “pop-wonder-superrare” slug often groups these 1/1s for discovery and tracking.

## The Art

Pop-inflected, crypto-aware. Bold colour, graphic style, life/death and meme-adjacent themes. Each 1/1 is unique. The vibe is consistent with Pop Wonder Editions but typically more refined or singular. Check SuperRare and OpenSea for examples.

## Notable Pieces

1/1s. Rarity is built in. Secondary activity and prices depend on piece, timing, and collector demand. Pop Wonder’s broader audience supports interest. Check SuperRare profile and OpenSea (if mirrored) for activity.

## Context for Collectors

SuperRare vs Editions vs other Pop Wonder drops—confirm which you’re buying. 1/1 liquidity is thinner than editions. You’re buying the image and the artist. Verify platform and contract.

## Personal Take

Pop Wonder SuperRare is the “serious collector” entry point for Pop Wonder. The 1/1s hold up as art objects. If you like the artist, the SuperRare work is the top tier. Not overrated.
