## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- **Bridges are high-value honeypots.** Cross-chain bridges custody enormous asset pools and operate across trust boundaries, making them the most attacked infrastructure in crypto. A bridge compromise doesn't just drain one protocol — it can destabilize entire ecosystems by creating unbacked wrapped assets.
- **Trust model taxonomy:** Bridges range from fully trusted (centralized multisig) to trust-minimized (light client + fraud/validity proofs). The trust model determines the attack surface: compromising validators vs. exploiting smart contract logic vs. manipulating message verification.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Map the bridge's message verification pathway: Who attests that a deposit on Chain A occurred? How many validators/relayers/guardians must agree? What's the threshold for compromise?
- Evaluate the validator set: How many, who are they, how are keys managed, what's the slashing/accountability mechanism?
- Examine historical incident response: How quickly was the exploit detected? Was there a pause mechanism? How were affected users compensated?

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Validator key compromise** is the dominant attack vector. Ronin ($625M, March 2022): 5 of 9 validators compromised, including 4 controlled by Sky Mavis + 1 Axie DAO validator whose access hadn't been revoked. Social engineering + poor key management, not a code bug.
- **Smart contract logic errors** enable message forgery. Wormhole ($320M, February 2022): Attacker bypassed signature verification on Solana by exploiting a deprecated `verify_signatures` function, minting 120K wETH without a corresponding Ethereum deposit.
- **Chaotic mint exploits** emerge from weak message validation. Nomad ($190M, August 2022): A routine upgrade initialized a trusted root as 0x00, meaning any message could be proven valid. Once one attacker demonstrated the exploit, hundreds copied the transaction — a "crowd-sourced" hack.

**Decision Framework:**
- **Validator count and distribution:** Higher threshold (e.g., 13-of-19 vs. 5-of-9) with independent, geographically distributed validators reduces key compromise risk.
- **Proof mechanism:** Optimistic bridges (fraud proofs with challenge period) and ZK bridges (validity proofs) are structurally safer than pure multisig attestation, though newer and less battle-tested.
- **TVL concentration:** Avoid bridges where the majority of an asset's cross-chain supply flows through a single bridge. If that bridge fails, the wrapped asset depegs.
- **Pause mechanisms:** Can the bridge be halted in an emergency? Fast pause capability limits exploit damage.

### Major Exploit Case Studies

**Ronin Bridge ($625M):** Attack vector was entirely off-chain — compromised private keys of validators. The exploit went undetected for 6 days until a user couldn't withdraw. Lesson: validator key management is as critical as smart contract security. Rotating keys, hardware security modules (HSMs), and anomaly detection on large withdrawals are essential.

**Wormhole ($320M):** On-chain exploit targeting Solana's verification logic. Jump Crypto (Wormhole's backer) backstopped the losses. Lesson: cross-VM bridges (EVM ↔ Solana) have expanded attack surfaces because each VM has different security assumptions and library behaviors.

**Nomad ($190M):** The simplest exploit conceptually — a misconfigured initialization made every message provably valid. The "crowd-sourced" nature (hundreds of copycats within hours) demonstrated that once an exploit pattern is public, speed of pause is everything.

### Safer Bridging Practices

**Minimize bridge exposure:** Bridge only what you need. Don't park large holdings in wrapped assets. If you need exposure on another chain, consider native assets or protocols that don't require bridging.

**Prefer canonical bridges** where they exist (Ethereum ↔ L2 rollup bridges like Arbitrum/Optimism native bridges). These inherit the security of the L1 and use fraud/validity proofs rather than external validator sets. Trade-off: withdrawal periods (7 days for optimistic rollups).

**Diversify bridge paths:** If you must bridge significant value, split across multiple bridges and multiple transactions. A single bridge failure then doesn't wipe out the full position.

**Monitor after bridging:** Watch for bridge incident reports (DeFi Llama hacks tracker, Rekt News). If a bridge you've used is compromised, wrapped assets may depeg before you can react. Speed matters.
