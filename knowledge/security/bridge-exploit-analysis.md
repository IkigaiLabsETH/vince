### Major Exploit Case Studies

**Ronin Bridge ($625M):** Attack vector was entirely off-chain — compromised private keys of validators. The exploit went undetected for 6 days until a user couldn't withdraw. Lesson: validator key management is as critical as smart contract security. Rotating keys, hardware security modules (HSMs), and anomaly detection on large withdrawals are essential.

**Wormhole ($320M):** On-chain exploit targeting Solana's verification logic. Jump Crypto (Wormhole's backer) backstopped the losses. Lesson: cross-VM bridges (EVM ↔ Solana) have expanded attack surfaces because each VM has different security assumptions and library behaviors.

**Nomad ($190M):** The simplest exploit conceptually — a misconfigured initialization made every message provably valid. The "crowd-sourced" nature (hundreds of copycats within hours) demonstrated that once an exploit pattern is public, speed of pause is everything.

### Safer Bridging Practices

**Minimize bridge exposure:** Bridge only what you need. Don't park large holdings in wrapped assets. If you need exposure on another chain, consider native assets or protocols that don't require bridging.

**Prefer canonical bridges** where they exist (Ethereum ↔ L2 rollup bridges like Arbitrum/Optimism native bridges). These inherit the security of the L1 and use fraud/validity proofs rather than external validator sets. Trade-off: withdrawal periods (7 days for optimistic rollups).

**Diversify bridge paths:** If you must bridge significant value, split across multiple bridges and multiple transactions. A single bridge failure then doesn't wipe out the full position.

**Monitor after bridging:** Watch for bridge incident reports (DeFi Llama hacks tracker, Rekt News). If a bridge you've used is compromised, wrapped assets may depeg before you can react. Speed matters.
