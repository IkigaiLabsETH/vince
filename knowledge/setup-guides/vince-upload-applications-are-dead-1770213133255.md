UPLOAD

vibe coders should understand something:

i love how easy AI is making it for people to build their own apps, push them into production, and start businesses

but let's be clear: the future is not in humans building consumer-facing apps

the future is everything becomes an API which your personal AI agent can interact with in ways which suit your specific needs and lifestyle (down to the very specific needs of you as an individual)

the fact that you can use the machines to build your apps is just an intermediate step to the machines creating the apps for you, LIVE, as you need them

so the value of you learning how to build apps now really lies in you learning how to create a business model behind that app- not in creating the piece of software that is the app itself

sure, there will be templates for how you can interact with those apps/APIs, but your personal AI will pick one and tailor it even further for you. and a lot of the time, you won't even need to interact with a UI beyond speaking with your AI assistant

let me give you an example: would you rather use an app like Uber or Uber Eats, or would you rather just ask your AI assistant to get you a ride somewhere or to show you menus for the type of food you might be interested in and you pick one? the value in apps like that is not in the app installed on your phone. it's in the backend business model which connects the customer with providers. and personal AI assistants actually open the door to you being able to seamlessly use multiple business APIs without worrying in the slightest about which app or intermediate provider they come from

there is a decent chance apps as you know them will be mostly dead in ~5-10 years

and yes, there are some apps which will still require deep optimization and that is where the hardcore coders may still be needed. but machines will get better at that, and if you take one look at the AAA gaming landscape, you should understand that hyper-optimized code isn't as valuable as it used to be

but what will be valuable is owning the APIs with the most use and liquidity. and yes, a lot of those will use public blockchains

things are going to accelerate and get very weird very quickly from here

Applications are dead.
Not dying. Not “being disrupted.” Dead.
The idea that software exists as a fixed object you install, open, update, manage, and mentally babysit belongs to a different era. It made sense when computers were dumb, networks were slow, and humans had to do all the coordination themselves. That era is over, even if most of our interfaces still pretend otherwise.
What replaces applications is not better applications. It is the disappearance of the application altogether.
Software is becoming something that spawns.
Not downloaded.
Not launched.
Not configured.
Spawned.
It comes into existence at the moment it is needed, shaped precisely to the situation at hand, and it disappears when the moment passes. No leftovers. No clutter. No cognitive residue.
I call this Spawnware.
Spawnware is software that exists only in potential until the conditions are right. It does not live on your device or behind an icon. It lives in latency, context, and intent. When those align, it appears. When they no longer do, it is gone.
If you have played video games, you already understand this intuitively. Enemies do not exist everywhere all at once. They spawn when you enter the right zone. Menus surface when you hover. Objects appear when the game state demands them. Nothing is permanent unless it needs to be.
That same logic is now arriving in software.
This is not a metaphor. It is a shift in ontology.
Applications assumed static interfaces, generic users, repeatable workflows, and long stretches of time spent “inside” the tool. Spawnware assumes a specific moment, a specific person, and a specific intent. The goal is not time spent in software. The goal is zero time spent thinking about software at all.
Applications asked you to adapt to them. Spawnware adapts to you.
With generative systems, large models, ambient context, shared state, and fast execution, there is no longer a technical reason for software to pre-exist its use. Prebuilt applications are a caching strategy from an era of scarcity. We no longer live in scarcity. We live in latency.
Spawnware is how latency disappears.
In a spawnware world, there is no such thing as “opening an app.” There is only the moment you realize you need to do something, and then the capability exists. A writing surface that spawns only for this document, this tone, this audience. A financial interface that spawns only for this decision, this portfolio, this risk profile. A coordination surface that spawns only for this group, this moment, this outcome.
No menus. No dashboards. No feature discovery. No onboarding tours.
The interface is the answer.
Lifecycle matters here. Spawnware has a beginning and an end. It spawns, does its job, and despawns. There is nothing to maintain, nothing to version, nothing to accumulate. Applications piled up. Spawnware evaporates.
This also changes what it means to create software.
In the old world, builders shipped objects and users learned them. In the spawnware world, builders design conditions, primitives, and taste. The software itself is assembled on demand. What you author is not the thing, but the rules by which the thing comes into being.
This is why “prompting” is a transitional concept. Eventually, you will no more prompt software than you prompt your eyesight. The system will infer. It will already be there.
Spawnware is not “AI apps.” That framing is already obsolete. AI apps are still apps. Spawnware is post-app.
Yes, this sounds like magic. It should.
Every major abstraction shift does. Applications felt magical compared to command lines. The web felt magical compared to disks. Search felt magical compared to directories. Spawnware will feel boring in five years. People will say, “Of course it just shows up.” That is how you know the transition is complete.
So if you are still building applications, ask yourself what you are really building. Are you shipping an object, or are you designing the conditions for something to spawn?
Because the future of software is not installed.
It is spawned.
