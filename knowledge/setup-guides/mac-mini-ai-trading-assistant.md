# Building a 24/7 AI Trading Assistant with ClawdBot on Mac Mini

**Source**: Direct Input - January 27, 2025

## Summary

A comprehensive guide to setting up ClawdBot, an open-source AI agent, as a dedicated 24/7 trading assistant running on a Mac Mini. The framework transforms trading workflows through automated Discord monitoring, frictionless trade journaling, research automation, and backtesting capabilities. The setup costs ~$800 upfront plus $200/month for Claude Max, positioning it as a structural advantage for serious traders who can synthesize information faster and maintain behavioral consistency through automation.

The core insight is isolation - running the AI agent on a dedicated machine with read-only permissions to sensitive data, while leveraging its ability to control everything on the computer: browse web, open apps, write code, send emails, manage files. The agent becomes a true AI employee that works while you sleep, not just another chatbot tool.

## Key Points

• **Dedicated Hardware Approach**: Mac Mini ($599) provides isolated environment preventing AI from accessing main trading machine or sensitive accounts
• **Discord Intelligence Edge**: Bot monitors 15+ trading Discord servers continuously, flags relevant messages, and provides curated summaries instead of scrolling through hundreds of messages
• **Frictionless Trade Journaling**: Single text message logs trades with automatic market context, timestamps, and detailed analysis - removes friction that kills consistency
• **Automated Research Pipeline**: 7am daily briefs with overnight futures, technical levels, earnings calendar, gaps, and fintwit aggregation tailored to personal trading style
• **Natural Language Backtesting**: Text simple questions like "backtest SPY gap downs >1%" and bot writes Python, pulls data, runs analysis, and delivers results
• **Infinite Memory System**: Unlike ChatGPT, stores all observations, trade thoughts, and market synthesis permanently for searchable reference
• **Overnight Work Capability**: Assign research tasks before bed, wake up to completed analysis and dashboards
• **Information Processing Advantage**: Synthesizes data from multiple sources faster than manual monitoring while maintaining behavioral consistency through automated good habits

## Quotes

> "Not a chatbot. Not another AI tool you forget about. A fulltime AI employee that controls a computer, remembers everything I say, and works while I sleep."

> "The information edge in trading often comes from synthesis — connecting dots across multiple sources faster than others. An AI agent that aggregates and filters in real-time is a genuine workflow improvement."

> "I almost don't want to share this because of the sheer amount of edge here. The truth is 99% of people reading this won't take action anyway."

> "The traders who figure out how to integrate this into their workflow are going to have a structural advantage. Not because the AI makes their decisions — it doesn't, and shouldn't — but because it handles the 80% of work that isn't decision-making."

> "In 2-3 years when everyone catches on, I think traders who haven't adapted — especially in small caps — are going to get blown out. Hard."

## Implications

This represents a fundamental shift in trading infrastructure where individual traders can access institutional-level information processing and behavioral consistency tools. The framework attacks both pillars of trading edge: faster information synthesis and automated execution of good habits that typically get skipped due to friction.

The setup enables compound learning through persistent memory and automated pattern recognition across all market observations. Instead of losing insights to scattered notes or forgotten thoughts, every observation builds into a searchable database of personal market intelligence.

Early adopters gain structural advantages in information processing speed, research depth, and behavioral consistency - advantages that compound over time as the system learns preferences and optimizes workflows.

## Action Items

• **Hardware Setup**: Purchase Mac Mini ($599 base model) and set up isolated environment with separate Gmail and accounts
• **Security Configuration**: Implement read-only permissions for sensitive data like Notion and brokerage accounts
• **Discord Integration**: Configure bot to monitor relevant trading Discord servers with custom filtering criteria
• **Journaling Workflow**: Create trade logging template with screenshot capability and automatic market context
• **Research Automation**: Build 7am daily brief pipeline with futures, technicals, earnings, gaps, and fintwit monitoring
• **Memory Training**: Begin feeding bot with 5+ years of existing trade writeups and playbooks for context learning
• **Backtesting Framework**: Test natural language backtesting capabilities with simple strategies first
• **Risk Management**: Establish verification protocols for all bot-generated research before acting on insights
