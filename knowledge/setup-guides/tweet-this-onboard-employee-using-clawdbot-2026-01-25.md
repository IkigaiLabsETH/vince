## Key Insights

• **Structured AI Onboarding**: Treating AI agents like human employees with formal documentation requirements
• **Four Core Files Framework**:
  - `IDENTITY.md` = defines the AI's role and persona
  - `USER.md` = captures user preferences and working style
  - `SOUL.md` = establishes tone, personality, and operational boundaries
  - `AGENTS.md` = sets operating rules and protocols
• **Professional AI Management**: Moving beyond ad-hoc prompting to systematic AI workforce management
• **Consistency Through Documentation**: Standardized onboarding ensures reliable AI behavior across sessions

## Context for Trading/Investing

This framework addresses a critical gap in crypto trading operations where AI agents are increasingly used for:
- Market analysis and research
- Trade execution assistance
- Portfolio monitoring
- Content creation and communication

Without proper "onboarding," AI agents provide inconsistent results, miss context, and fail to align with trading philosophies or risk management approaches.

## Actionable Takeaways

• **Implement Structured AI Onboarding**: Create the four core documentation files for any AI trading assistants
• **Define Trading Identity**: Clearly specify the AI's role (analyst, executor, researcher) in `IDENTITY.md`
• **Document Trading Preferences**: Include risk tolerance, preferred strategies, and communication style in `USER.md`
• **Set Operational Boundaries**: Define what the AI can/cannot do regarding trades and recommendations in `SOUL.md`
• **Establish Trading Rules**: Create clear protocols for market analysis, position sizing, and risk management in `AGENTS.md`
• **Version Control**: Treat AI documentation like code - track changes and improvements over time
