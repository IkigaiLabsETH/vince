## Audit Summary

### Deleted (3 files)

- `kelly-btc/satoshis-knowledge/bitcoin/latest.md` — 127 bytes, stale "July 2025" MicroStrategy data
- `art-collections/vince-upload-to-our-knowledge-base-let-s-try-if-you-can-read-th-1770206290303.md` — failed ingestion, just a broken URL with no content
- `clawterm/OPENCLAW_RELEASES.md` — 290 bytes, just a URL pointer with no substance

### Not deleted but low-content (have methodology boilerplate only)

Most "low content" files (75+) actually contain useful curated lists (wine, hotels, restaurants, lifestyle rules) behind the methodology template. These were **kept** because the methodology section + curated content together provide value.

## Stale Content Categories

### High priority — contain specific prices/metrics that are outdated

| Category           | Files | Notes                                                                  |

## Recommendations

1. **Refresh `kelly-btc/satoshis-knowledge/`** — MicroStrategy data, BTC cycle projections, and "2025" predictions need current numbers
2. **Refresh `ai-crypto/`** — AI token landscape has evolved significantly; market caps and project status outdated
3. **Refresh `rwa/rwa-overview-2026.md`** — Despite the filename, contains 2024 data
4. **Refresh `macro-economy/calendar.md`** — Economic calendar likely stale
5. **Refresh `altcoins/top100-altcoins.md`** — Rankings shift quarterly
6. **Leave essay/opinion files alone** — They have the "historical examples" disclaimer and methodology framework; the thinking is the value, not the numbers
7. **Leave `the-good-life/`** — Curated lifestyle content is mostly timeless; Michelin stars change annually but the restaurant lists are still useful as starting points

> **Note:** Most files already carry the "Numbers, prices, and metrics are OUTDATED" disclaimer via the methodology framework template. This is working as designed — the knowledge base prioritizes _how to think_ over _what the numbers were_.
