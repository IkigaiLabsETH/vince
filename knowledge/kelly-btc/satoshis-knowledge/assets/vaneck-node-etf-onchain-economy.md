# VanEck NODE ETF: Onchain Economy Investment Strategy

## Overview
The VanEck Onchain Economy ETF (NYSE: NODE) represents a strategic investment approach to the emerging onchain economy. Rather than direct cryptocurrency exposure, NODE provides equity-based access to companies building, enabling, or leveraging blockchain infrastructure.

**Key Thesis**: The onchain economy represents a foundational shift toward decentralized, blockchain-based infrastructure for value exchange, data coordination, and trustless computation.

## What is the Onchain Economy?

### Definition
The onchain economy is an emerging digital system where economic activity occurs natively on blockchain networks, replacing centralized intermediaries with transparent, autonomous code execution.

### Core Components
- **Crypto-native companies**: Pure-play blockchain businesses
- **Blockchain-enabled infrastructure**: Physical and digital infrastructure supporting blockchain networks
- **Traditional enablers**: Established companies facilitating tokenized finance
- **Consumer-facing platforms**: Applications bringing blockchain technology to mainstream users
- **Decentralized computing**: Storage and finance protocols

### Key Capabilities
- Programmable finance
- Borderless asset transfers
- Tokenized infrastructure
- Decentralized coordination
- Trustless computation

- **Growth exposure**: To emerging digital economy trends

This represents a sophisticated approach to investing in the blockchain revolution through established equity markets rather than direct cryptocurrency exposure.
