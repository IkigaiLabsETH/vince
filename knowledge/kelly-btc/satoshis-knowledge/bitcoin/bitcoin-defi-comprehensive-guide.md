## Market Intelligence

### Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR)
**Critical Market Indicator for Bitcoin DeFi**

**Current Alert: SSR at 0.94 and Rising**

**What is SSR:**
- Ratio between Bitcoin's market cap and total stablecoin supply
- Measures "dry powder" (capital waiting for deployment)
- **Low SSR**: Abundant buying power (lots of stablecoins relative to BTC)
- **High SSR**: Depleted reserves and limited upside fuel
- **Trend Changes**: Direction shifts often precede major market moves

**Current Market Context:**
- Markets showing strong green trends
- Meme coin season in full swing
- General market euphoria
- SSR beginning to trend upward (warning signal)

**Smart Money Strategy:**
- While retail celebrates "Alt Season," institutions watch SSR for exit signals
- Rapid SSR increase could indicate smart money scaling out
- Track SSR on TradingView for real-time monitoring

**Investment Implications:**
- Rising SSR may signal reduced buying power
- Smart money often exits during retail euphoria
- Monitor SSR trends for position sizing decisions
