# Bitcoin-Backed Loans and the Bitcoin-First Lifestyle

## Overview
Bitcoin-backed loans represent a revolutionary approach to liquidity that allows Bitcoin holders to access cash without selling their BTC. This strategy, popularized by companies like MicroStrategy and platforms like Strike, enables individuals and businesses to maintain their Bitcoin conviction while accessing necessary liquidity for operations and lifestyle.

## Strike's Bitcoin-Backed Loans

### Key Features
- **Loan Range**: Starting at $10K with no maximum limits
- **Multiple Loans**: Up to 3 active loans simultaneously
- **Interest Rates**: 9.5%–13% APR depending on loan size
- **Payment Structure**: Interest-only payments
- **No Fees**: No origination fees, early repayment penalties, or credit checks
- **Secure Storage**: BTC held securely, not rehypothecated (per current policy)
- **Management**: Fully managed through Strike's mobile app

### Operational Benefits
- **Unlimited Bitcoin transactions**: Facilitate large-scale purchases and sales
- **Fiat integration**: Seamless conversion between BTC and USD
- **Enterprise-grade custody**: Secure storage of digital assets
- **API integration**: Programmatic automation of financial processes
- **Global reach**: Enable fast, low-cost Lightning payments worldwide

## Re-hypothecation Risks and Considerations

### What is Re-hypothecation?
Re-hypothecation occurs when a platform sends customer collateral to another party to generate additional revenue. Each re-hypothecation layer increases risk exposure.

### Strike's Current Terms
- Single re-hypothecation is permitted to capital providers (e.g., NYDIG)
- Capital providers cannot further re-hypothecate the collateral
- No mandatory disclosure to borrowers about collateral placement

### Risk Assessment
- Higher risk due to lack of transparency in collateral handling
- No ability for users to assess counterparty risk
- Potential exposure to capital provider's financial health

### Recommended Solutions
- Implement tri-party custody arrangements
- Use Bitcoin-native multi-sig contracts between borrower, platform, and capital provider
- Require transparent disclosure of collateral placement

## Bitcoin-First LLC Structure

### Core Components

#### 1. BTC Treasury Strategy
- Bitcoin as the primary treasury asset (not ETH, stablecoins, or DeFi tokens)
- BTC held in cold storage
- Only moves when posted as collateral
- Never sold for operational liquidity

#### 2. Legal Structure via Otonomos
- Crypto-native LLC formation
- Legally compliant entity with digital asset DNA
- Designed for sovereignty and minimal external dependencies

#### 3. Cap Table via Fairmint
- Tokenized and automated equity management
- Dynamic contributor rewards without losing control
- Maintains optionality without traditional fundraising

#### 4. Treasury Engine Strategy
- Leverage Strike Business for real estate development
- Transform Bitcoin treasury into dynamic operational tool
- Asset protection through secured loans against BTC holdings

## The LiveTheLifeTV Model

### Philosophy
"Freedom isn't found in a destination, it's in the way you travel. With Bitcoin, you move on your own terms, fund your own story, and live the good life."

### Core Principles
- **No seed round**: Self-funded through Bitcoin treasury
