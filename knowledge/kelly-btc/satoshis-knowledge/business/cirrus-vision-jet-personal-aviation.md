# Cirrus Vision Jet & G7+ Series: Revolutionary Personal Aviation

## Overview

The Cirrus Vision Jet and SR G7+ Series represent a revolutionary approach to personal aviation, combining cutting-edge technology with unparalleled safety features. With nearly 10,000 aircraft delivered since 1999, the SR Series has been the beating heart of personal aviation, while the Vision Jet redefines single-engine jet accessibility.

## The G7+ Revolution: Gateway to Jet Ownership

### Core Philosophy

The G7+ represents not just a refresh, but a philosophical evolution: the fusion of digital intelligence, luxury design, and intuitive flight systems. It serves as the perfect gateway to jet ownership, offering a seamless transition path from piston to turbine aircraft.

### Revolutionary Safety: Safe Return™ Technology

**World's First FAA-Approved Autonomous Emergency Landing**

- The SR Series G7+ features the world's first FAA-approved autonomous emergency landing system integrated into a single-engine piston aircraft
- Safe Return™ Emergency Autoland provides pilot and passengers with automated landing option in emergencies

#### How Safe Return™ Works

1. **Advanced sensors and sophisticated algorithms**
2. **Automated flight control systems**
3. **Automatic ATC communication**
4. **Terrain and weather avoidance**
5. **Complete landing sequence to full stop**
6. **Automatic engine shutdown**

With a single button press, Safe Return™ takes control of the aircraft, communicates with air traffic control, navigates to the nearest airport, performs terrain- and weather-avoiding landing, comes to complete stop, and shuts down the engine.
