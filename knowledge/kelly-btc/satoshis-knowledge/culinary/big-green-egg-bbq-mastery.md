4. Add larger lumps over burning area
5. Leave lid and vents open for 10 minutes
6. Close lid and adjust vents for target temperature

### Charcoal Loading Guide
**For Grilling**: Fill to fire ring level
**For Smoking**: Fill firebox to top rim
**For Long Cooks**: Pack charcoal tightly for extended burn time

## Smoking Techniques

### Wood Selection for Smoking
**Fruit Woods (Mild, Sweet)**:
- Apple: Mild, sweet flavor - great for pork and poultry
- Cherry: Sweet, fruity flavor - excellent for beef and pork
- Peach: Delicate, sweet flavor - perfect for poultry

**Nut Woods (Medium, Rich)**:
- Hickory: Strong, bacon-like flavor - classic for ribs and pork
- Pecan: Rich, nutty flavor - great for beef and poultry
- Oak: Mild, clean flavor - excellent for brisket

**Strong Woods (Bold, Intense)**:
- Mesquite: Powerful, earthy flavor - ideal for beef and lamb
- Walnut: Strong, slightly bitter - use sparingly

### Smoking Setup
**For Low & Slow (225°F - 250°F)**:
1. Install ConvEGGtor legs up (indirect heat)
2. Add 3-5 wood chunks around fire perimeter
3. Place drip pan with hot water on ConvEGGtor
4. Set cooking grid above drip pan
5. Maintain consistent temperature for entire cook

**Wood Usage Guidelines**:
- **Chips**: 2-3 handfuls for shorter cooks
- **Chunks**: 3-5 fist-sized pieces for long cooks
- **Placement**: Around fire perimeter, not in center
- **No Soaking**: Modern consensus is dry wood burns better

### Smoking Process
**Clean Smoke**: Wait for thin blue smoke before adding food
**Temperature Stability**: Maintain ±10°F of target temperature
**Moisture Management**: Use water pan for longer cooks
**Spritzing**: Apple juice or apple cider vinegar every 2 hours

## Grilling Techniques

### Direct Grilling Setup
**High Heat Searing (600°F+)**:
1. Remove ConvEGGtor
2. Open vents fully
3. Preheat 15-20 minutes
4. Clean and oil cooking grid
5. Sear 2-3 minutes per side

**Medium Heat Grilling (400°F-500°F)**:
1. Partially close vents
2. Use zone cooking (hot and cool sides)
3. Move food between zones as needed

### Reverse Searing Technique
1. Start with indirect heat at 275°F
2. Cook until internal temp is 10°F below target
3. Remove ConvEGGtor and open vents
4. Sear over direct heat 1-2 minutes per side
5. Perfect for thick steaks and chops

## Cooking Time Guidelines

### Smoking Times (at 225°F)
**Brisket**: 1.5 hours per pound (12-14 hours for 8-10 lb)
**Pork Shoulder**: 1.5-2 hours per pound (8-12 hours for 6-8 lb)
**Ribs**: 5-6 hours (baby back), 6-7 hours (spare ribs)
**Whole Chicken**: 3-4 hours
**Turkey**: 20-25 minutes per pound
**Salmon**: 1-2 hours depending on thickness

### Grilling Times (at 400°F-500°F)

**Materials**: Pink butcher paper (preferred) or aluminum foil
**Benefits**: Speeds cooking, prevents over-darkening
**Technique**: Wrap tightly, return to smoker until done

### Spatchcocking Poultry
**Process**: Remove backbone, flatten bird
**Benefits**: Faster cooking, more even temperature
**Technique**: Cook breast-side up at 375°F for 45-60 minutes

### Caveman/Cowboy Cooking
**Method**: Cook directly on hot coals
**Best For**: Thick steaks, corn on the cob
**Technique**: Place food directly on glowing coals
**Results**: Incredible char and smoky flavor

## Essential Safety Tips

### Fire Safety
**Burping**: Always "burp" the EGG before fully opening
- Crack lid 1-2 inches for 5 seconds
- Allows built-up heat to escape
- Prevents dangerous flashback

**Placement**: Keep EGG away from structures
- Minimum 3 feet from deck railings
- Never use indoors or under cover
- Ensure adequate ventilation

### Handling Safety
**Hot Surfaces**: Ceramic exterior gets extremely hot
- Don't place on wooden surfaces
- Use heat-resistant gloves
- Keep children and pets away

**Ash Management**: Clean ash regularly for proper airflow
- Remove ash when cool
- Use ash as garden fertilizer
- Never dispose of hot ash

## Maintenance & Care

### Regular Cleaning
**After Each Use**:
- Brush cooking grid while warm
- Burn off grease for 10 minutes
- Close vents to extinguish fire

**Weekly** (with regular use):
- Clean ash from firebox
- Check gasket seal condition
- Inspect ceramic for cracks

**Monthly**:
- Deep clean cooking grid
- Replace gasket if damaged
- Check hardware tightness

### Gasket Replacement
**Signs of Wear**: Frayed edges, poor seal, excessive air leaks
**Replacement**: High-temperature adhesive gasket
**Process**: Remove old gasket, clean surface, apply new gasket
**Tip**: Replace during "clean burn" when old gasket melts

### Storage & Protection
**Covers**: Use heavy-duty, properly fitting cover
**Seasonal Storage**: Clean thoroughly, ensure complete dryness
**Winter Use**: EGG performs excellently in cold weather

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Temperature Problems
**Can't Reach High Temps**:
- Check for ash buildup restricting airflow
- Verify vents are fully open
- Ensure adequate fuel load

**Temperature Overshooting**:
- Close vents gradually
- Add more unlit charcoal to cool down
- Be patient - ceramic takes time to adjust

**Uneven Cooking**:
- Check ConvEGGtor placement
- Rotate food halfway through cooking
- Ensure proper preheating

### Smoke Issues
**Too Much Smoke** (white, billowing):
- Reduce wood amount
- Ensure proper airflow
