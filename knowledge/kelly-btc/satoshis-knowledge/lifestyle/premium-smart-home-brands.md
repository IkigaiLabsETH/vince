### Core Vision

Create a calm, intelligent, and spatially refined villa inspired by Malibu minimalism, where every detail is curated for effortless living and sensory harmony. The architecture should dissolve into the natural landscape, using expansive glazing and organic materials to blur the boundaries between indoors and out.
