# AI Coding with Cursor: The New Game of Development

## The Three-Currency Philosophy

### The New Game: AI, BTC, and Time

You now operate with three core currencies: **AI (Knowledge)**, **BTC (Money)**, and **Time (which remains finite)**. The strategy is simple: when you lack one, leverage the other two to acquire it.

#### Strategic Exchange Matrix

**Not enough AI?**

- Spend time training it
- Spend BTC to fine-tune it

**Not enough BTC?**

- Offer your AI services
- Trade your time for sats

**Not enough Time?**

- Automate with AI
- Buy back your time with BTC

> The old game was to trade time for money.  
> The new game is to build AI, stack sats, and reclaim time.

## Purpose as the Cure

### The Building Imperative

If you've ever felt lost, adrift, or that you aren't moving in the right direction, there's a powerful antidote: **building something**. For many of us, life can feel like it's in black and white—a cycle of restless nights and lethargic days, with no tangible proof of progress.

Discovering the ability to take an idea from your mind and turn it into a real product changes everything. When you build, you create purpose. You start waking up excited and going to bed satisfied. Life shifts into full color because you have concrete evidence of your forward momentum.

### A Simple Path to Finding Purpose

If you're lacking direction, follow this guaranteed path:

1. **Go to an AI** like Grok or ChatGPT
2. **Tell the AI** what you post about or what you're passionate about
3. **Ask it** for common challenges people have in your niche
4. **Ask it** what software you could build to solve those challenges
5. **Download Cursor** and build one of those projects

> The cure to almost everything in life is purpose.  
> If you're ever feeling lost, just start building. Just start moving forward.

## Cursor IDE Mastery for Solo Developers

### Core Workflow Features

Cursor is an "AI-first" IDE that integrates a powerful AI assistant directly into the coding workflow. Its features like inline AI prompts, context-aware chat, and multi-file edits allow a single developer to generate and refactor code quickly using natural language.

#### 1. Inline AI Prompting and Code Generation (Composer)

**Hotkey:** `Cmd/Ctrl + K`

The Inline Composer opens a prompt bar for generating or modifying code via natural language. You can describe a task in plain English and have Cursor write the code for you at the cursor location.

**Best Practices:**

- **Be Specific:** "Create a Prisma model for User with fields id, name, email (unique), createdAt timestamp"
- **Request Refactoring:** "Optimize this query using Prisma transactions"
- **Instant Apply:** Review and apply changes with one click

**Example Prompt:**

```
Write a Next.js API route in /pages/api/prices.js that fetches the top 10 cryptocurrency prices from CoinGecko and stores them in our Prisma database.
```

#### 2. AI Chat: In-IDE Assistant for Debugging and Q&A

**Hotkey:** `Cmd/Ctrl + L`

Cursor provides an AI Chat panel where you can have a conversation with an AI that is aware of your codebase. This is extremely useful for debugging, getting explanations, or brainstorming implementation approaches without leaving the IDE.

**Pro Tip:** Switch to Agent mode (`Cmd/Ctrl + I`) to let Cursor perform multi-step code changes and even run commands for you, while you review each diff.

**Workflow:**

- Use inline `Ctrl + K` for quick edits
- Use Agent chat for multi-step or cross-file tasks
- Highlight code or errors and open chat to include them as context

#### 3. Multi-File Context and Refactoring at Scale

Cursor's multi-file context awareness means the AI can understand your entire project structure, not just the file you're editing. You can explicitly bring other files into the conversation using `@filename`.

**Example:** "Rename all occurrences of the Customer model to Client across the codebase."

**Pro Tip:** Use `Ctrl + Enter` in chat to trigger a codebase-wide query, like "List all files where getServerSideProps is used."

### Prompt Engineering Strategies in Cursor

#### Core Principles

1. **Be Specific with Tasks:** Break down complex tasks into clear, single-purpose prompts
2. **Use Step-by-Step Instructions:** Guide the AI with ordered steps
3. **Leverage Project Context:** Remind the AI of relevant context, libraries, or conventions

#### Prompt Templates

**Debugging:**

```
Explain why I am getting [X error] in this file and suggest a fix.
```

**Refactoring:**

```
Refactor this function to be more modular and readable.
```

**Documentation:**

```
Add JSDoc comments to the following function.
```

**Performance:**

```
Optimize the database calls in this API route for performance.
```

**Schema Design:**

```
Create a Prisma schema for a Post model with fields: id (string, ID), title (string), content (string), authorId (relation to User).
```

**Multi-Step Fixes:**

```
Run npm run build and fix any TypeScript errors, then repeat until the build passes.
```

### Additional Cursor Features

#### Advanced Capabilities

- **Autocompletion and Imports:** AI-powered autocomplete generates multi-line code suggestions and auto-imports modules
- **AI-Generated Tests & Docs:** Instantly generate unit tests and doc comments for your functions
- **YOLO Mode (Autonomous Coding):** Let the AI execute changes without manual approval for each diff

> **Pro Tip:** Enable YOLO mode to let Cursor "just do it"—create files, run commands, and iterate until a goal is reached. Always use version control!

## API Integration Best Practices

### Crypto/Web3 Data Integration

#### API Selection Strategy

- **CoinGecko:** Excellent free API for price data
- **CryptoCompare:** Broader information and paid tiers
- **Blockchain.com:** Network data and transaction information

#### Integration Tips

1. **Choose the Right API:** CoinGecko's free API is an excellent default for price data
2. **Avoid Overuse:** Respect rate limits and use server-side caching and revalidation
3. **Secure Your Keys:** Keep API keys in .env and never push them to git or expose them client-side
4. **Test and Handle Errors:** Always handle fetch failures and validate external data before saving
5. **Stay Updated:** The crypto world evolves quickly—keep an eye on API docs

### Architecture Patterns

#### Next.js 14+ Stack

- **Core:** React functional components (TSX), strict TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- **Structure:** Atomic-design folders (atoms/molecules/organisms/templates/pages)
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Site must render core content without JS
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML5 + ARIA, meet WCAG 2.1 AA

#### Performance Targets

- **Lighthouse:** ≥ 90 score
- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP < 2.5s, INP/FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1, TTFB < 200ms
- **Code Splitting:** Dynamic imports + route-based chunking
- **Images:** Lazy-load below-the-fold, serve AVIF/WEBP

#### Crypto Data Layer

- **Fetch:** Live crypto prices & news from CoinGecko (no-key) or CryptoCompare/NewsData (key)
- **Cache:** Responses in Prisma, revalidate ISR pages every 60s
- **Expose:** /api/prices & /api/news endpoints, front-end consumes via SWR
