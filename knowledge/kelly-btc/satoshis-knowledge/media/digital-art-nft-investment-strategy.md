## Historical Parallels: Art Markets in Times of Disruption

### Post-WWII Art Surge (1945-1960s)
**Traditional Market**: Post-war prosperity fueled collecting surge; visionaries like Peggy Guggenheim backed abstract artists when considered radical, reaping massive rewards as works became canonical.

**Modern Equivalent**: Crypto millionaires investing in NFT art, treating digital assets as the new avant-garde movement defining 21st-century culture.

### 1970s Recession: Contrarian Opportunity
**Traditional Market**: Economic malaise created buying opportunities; contrarian collectors like Leo Castelli acquired undervalued masterpieces during downturn.

**Today's Parallel**: Current NFT bear market (50-80% below peaks) offers accumulation opportunities for blue-chip digital art.

### 1980s Boom and Early '90s Correction
**Traditional Market**: Wall Street wealth and Japanese money created speculative fervor, followed by inevitable 1990s crash that disciplined the market.

**NFT Echo**: 2021-22 NFT boom (20x growth to $25B) followed by 97% correction mirrors this exact pattern.

### Dot-Com Era: Tech Wealth Meets Art (1995-2005)
**Traditional Market**: Tech millionaires patronized edgy contemporary art, introducing technology as both subject and medium.

**Direct Lineage**: Crypto entrepreneurs today directly mirror dot-com collectors, but with native digital assets instead of physical pieces about technology.
