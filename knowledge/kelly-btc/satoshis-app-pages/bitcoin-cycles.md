# Bitcoin Cycles (Satoshis app page)

Strategic roadmap to 2030 and beyond. Bitcoin leads the market—your guide to accumulation and distribution with actionable insights for every phase.

## Core Strategy Philosophy

**Bitcoin Leads Everything.** Bitcoin's price action should guide both your entries and exits. When Bitcoin nears its previous all-time high around $125K, it's time to start scaling out of altcoin positions. The goal is to derisk and lock in profits systematically.

**Systematic Profit Taking:** Start with 20% of your long-term bags when Bitcoin approaches ATH. If alts have performed well, this might cover your entire initial investment. Continue taking 10-20% profits at each consolidation phase.

**Key Principles:**
- 2023-2024: Stack long-term bags (accumulation phase)
- 2025-2026: Scale out systematically (distribution phase)
- Moonbags: Keep 5-10% untouched for potential 1000x gains
- No Rebuying: Once sold, don't buy back—profit is profit

## Halving Cycle Patterns

On April 20th, 2024, Bitcoin's fourth halving. It cuts miner rewards in half and historically sets fire to the second half of the bull cycle. Historical peaks: 2012-13 (52 weeks to peak, $1,150), 2016-17 (74 weeks, $19,800), 2020-21 (78 weeks, $69,000), 2024-25 (74-78 weeks, $180K–$275K).

**Key insights:** Peaks occur 74-78 weeks post-halving. Each cycle multiplies previous peak by 10-20x. Logarithmic channel: Bitcoin respects long-term growth corridors.

## 2024-2025 Bull Market Strategy

**Target ranges:** Minimum $180,000 (Nov 2025 ± 3mo), Maximum $275,000, Speculative ceiling $928,000 (log curve). Support level $50,000.

**Scaling out:** First exit 20% at $125K (previous ATH); second 10-20% at consolidation; third 10-20% at $200K consolidation; moonbags 5-10%.

**Psychological pivot points:** $100K (gateway to $170K, $250K, $450K+); $170K (breakout); $250K (escape velocity—reserve asset status).

## 2026-2027 Bear Market Strategy

Bear market floor ~$60,000 (2026), recovery ~$80,000 (2027). Accumulation zone $60K–$80K. Duration 12-18 months. Preserve capital, DCA below $70K, focus on fundamentals, wait for reversal signals.

## 2028-2029 Bull Market Strategy

Halving April 2028. Targets: minimum $420,000 (Q4 2029 ± 6mo), maximum $690,000, speculative ceiling $1,200,000 (AI/sovereignty narrative). Pre-halving accumulate 6-12 months; legacy bags 5-10% for generational wealth.

**Narrative evolution:** AI sovereignty, fiat collapse, nation-state accumulation, Lightning scaling, privacy features, Bitcoin-native applications.

## Market Psychology & Signals

**Top signals:** Mass euphoria, mainstream media frenzy, FOMO peaks, altcoin mania. **Bottom signals:** "Bitcoin is dead" narratives, mass capitulation, fear dominance—contrarian opportunity at technical support.

## Risk Management

Portfolio: Bitcoin 60-70%, Ethereum 20-25%, Altcoins 10-15%, Cash 20-30%. Position sizing: core 5-10% per major asset, speculative 1-3% per alt, moonbags 0.5-1%. Never more than 5% in any single altcoin.

**Key takeaway:** Bitcoin leads the market. Stack in bear markets, scale out in bull markets. Keep moonbags. Don't rebuy. Trust the process. "The goal isn't to catch every move, but to catch the major moves and preserve capital for the next opportunity." Stay sovereign. Stay weird. Stay early.
