=== GROK DAILY PULSE (AUTO) ===
Date: Tuesday, Feb 10 | Regime: neutral  
Fear & Greed: 9/100  
Top Traders: 54.7% long  

**Prompt of the Day**: Screen mid-cap alts with >20% volume spike and RSI<30 for bounce setups targeting 2x in 48h.  

**Market Read**: Extreme fear at 9/100 signals capitulation, with neutral regime holding amid BTC testing $42k support. Traders lean slightly long at 54.7%, eyeing Fed minutes for dovish cues. Volatility spikes favor quick mean-reversion plays.  

**Top 3 Research Ideas**:  
1. BTC $44k calls (weekly) – perp long if holds 42k, 1:3 RR.  
2. ETH perp short below $2300 – target $2200, trail stop at 50EMA.  
3. HIP-3 on SOL: Long perp + $150 call + spot if RSI divergence confirms.  

**Knowledge Gap**: Quantify HIP-3 edge cases in fear regimes (<20 F&G).
