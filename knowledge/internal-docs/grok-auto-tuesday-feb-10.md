**1. Prompt of the Day**  
Screen BTC/ETH perp funding rates vs. OI for divergence signals; target pairs with negative funding + rising OI for short setups.

- **Options**: Buy BTC $100k calls (Mar exp) if spot breaks $98k; theta low in range.  
- **Perps**: Short ETHUSDT perp at $3.2k; trail stop above $3.3k on funding flip.  
- **HIP-3**: Layer BTC HIP-3 long (0.5x lev) on 4H RSI >50; exit at $99.5k resistance.

**4. Knowledge Gap**
