=== GROK DAILY PULSE (AUTO) ===
Date: Tuesday, Feb 10 | Regime: neutral  
Fear & Greed: 9/100  
Top Traders: 54.7% long  

**Prompt of the Day**  
Scan BTC 1D chart for hammer reversal patterns near $95K support; backtest with RSI<30 for 24h entry signals.  

**Market Read**  
Extreme fear at 9/100 signals capitulation, but neutral regime and 54.7% trader longs hint at dip-buying. BTC holds $96K amid $2T total cap bleed; VIX-like vol spikes favor mean-reversion plays. Watch ETH/BTC ratio breakdown for alt bleed.  

**Top 3 Research Ideas**  
1. **Options**: BTC $95K puts (7D exp) for theta decay if no breakdown; skew favors calls above $98K.  
2. **Perps**: Short ETHUSDT perp at $3.2K (3x lev) targeting $3K; trail stop at 2% drawdown.  
3. **HIP-3**: Enter HIP-3 long BTC on 4H close > $97K; scale 20% position with $1K stop.  

**Knowledge Gap**  
HIP-3 performance in Fear & Greed <20 regimes (win rate, drawdowns).
