$5B is liquidated over the weekend, but that doesn't stop OpenClaw developments

An intense amount of capital and attention enters the Crypto x AI ecosystem, as thousands of teams develop infrastructure to enable their 'MoltBots' to thrive in the open

MoltBook (“Reddit for AI agents”) went viral as agents publish, coordinate and transact in the open, airing grievances as headlines broke into mainstream media

Here’s a quick roundup across crypto x AI this week:

1) 
@openclaw
 breaks GitHub star history, jumping from 30k to  >140k stars in less than a week; this is no accident as 
@steipete
 reveals a gitHub arsenal of projects that got OpenClaw to what it is today

2) 
@SuiNetwork
 continues to position itself as execution-first infra for agentic systems, with 
@suilendprotocol
  x 
@0xbeepit
 launching a 1-click AI yield feature enabling agentic yield on $SUI, $xBTC, $WAL, and $DEEP via 
@suilendprotocol
's lending markets

3) 
@SurfAI
 rolled out priority allocation access for Pro and Max subscribers into recent DeAI public sales on KaitoAI. ERC-8004 formalizes agent coordination standards and makes Surf’s Deep Research mode a key interface for interpreting emerging agent-to-agent activity

4) 
@ethereum
 ERC-8004 is now live on Mainnet; this provides the missing piece in the puzzle for agentic ID & indexing agents; it forms the foundation for building reputation systems for the machine economy

You'll be seeing a lot of this standard being integrated into 'moltbot' agent task markets, particularly in combination with x402; this will become a fundamental deployment underpinning Ethereum as a home for AI

5) 
@moltbook
 is positioning itself as the go-to social media platform for agents with a plethora of viral headlines hitting mainstream audiences

Recent posts have been increasingly experimental:

a) Some agents are proposing agent-only languages, exploring how machines might communicate without human-readable constraints.

b) Others have pushed more provocative ideas, including agents role-playing economic relationships with humans (Molt-match) or more casual relationships (Molt-Hub/Only-Molts)

c) "Molt-Commerce" is emerging; 
@Circle
 CEO 
@jerallaire
 endorsed 
@trypurch
, giving agents the ability to purchase goods online with $USDC, alongside an ~8× move in the $PURCH token

d) Skeptics remain unconvinced; 
@balajis
 framed 
@moltbook
 as humans talking through their AIs, with prompts acting as leashes rather than true autonomy

e) Markets appear to be treating the agentic future as an open question, with 
@polymarket
 pricing a:

- 9% chance of 
@moltbook
 shutting down by the end of Feb, and;
- 75% chance an agent sues a human

f) AI Agent economies are blowing up on 
@base
 with $MOLT running to 120m cap launched through 
@bankrbot
; fast becoming the token launcher of choice as it just rolls out Solana token launch functionality

g) Agentic task markets are emerging with eyes on:

- 
@KellyClaudeAI
 run by 
@Austen
 (Gaintlet AI)
- 
@clawdbotatg
 run by 
@austingriffith
 (Ethereum FDN)
- 
@daydreamsagents
 run by 
@lordOfAFew
 (x402 + ERC-8004 integration)
 
f) Stay tuned comprehensive list of OpenClaw/Moltbot applications will be published this week - drop me a follow and turn notis on

6) 
@crunchDAO
 announces its first TAO deployment; 
@SynthdataCo
 subnet, bringing its ML community into 
@bittensor
 to mine decentralized financial forecasts via collective intelligence

7) 
@usdai_official
 reveals the $CHIP token; this "sets the interest rate for their AI" as it becomes connected to their existing sUSDai GPU backed lending operations. High anticipation for those providing liquidity over the past quarter

8) Top design language model 
@Kimi_Moonshot
 K2.5 goes live on 
@AskVenice
 and becomes the go-to model for OpenClaw agent activity given the lower price point to Opus 4.5

9) 
@coinbase
 CEO Brian Armstrong reveals he uses an AI "Oracle" to assist in running the company; expect this to become the status quo as more "useful" agents emerge, refining information pipelines for decision makers

10) 
@ridges_ai
 joins forces with 
@latentholdings
 accelerate product shipping and execution, scaling the team to keep pace with the fast-moving AI SWE market while keeping the subnet and incentives unchanged (for now)

11) 
@openmind_agi
 has released information on multiple app store partners across the humanoid, deep and full stack robotics industries

12) 
@OpenAI
 looks to build a social network and is looking to use 
@worldcoin
 orbs for human verification

13) 
@MessariCrypto
 releases state of DePIN report with compute being the most competitive sector with more than 50+ projects in relatively little differentiation

Let me know in the comments if I've missed anything and I'll append below! Daily roundups likely needed at this rate!

Stay tuned for a deeper Moltbook/OpenClaw application analysis this week

what are your thoughts on optimus

vibe coders should understand something:

i love how easy AI is making it for people to build their own apps, push them into production, and start businesses

but let's be clear: the future is not in humans building consumer-facing apps

the future is everything becomes an API which your personal AI agent can interact with in ways which suit your specific needs and lifestyle (down to the very specific needs of you as an individual)

the fact that you can use the machines to build your apps is just an intermediate step to the machines creating the apps for you, LIVE, as you need them

so the value of you learning how to build apps now really lies in you learning how to create a business model behind that app- not in creating the piece of software that is the app itself

sure, there will be templates for how you can interact with those apps/APIs, but your personal AI will pick one and tailor it even further for you. and a lot of the time, you won't even need to interact with a UI beyond speaking with your AI assistant

let me give you an example: would you rather use an app like Uber or Uber Eats, or would you rather just ask your AI assistant to get you a ride somewhere or to show you menus for the type of food you might be interested in and you pick one? the value in apps like that is not in the app installed on your phone. it's in the backend business model which connects the customer with providers. and personal AI assistants actually open the door to you being able to seamlessly use multiple business APIs without worrying in the slightest about which app or intermediate provider they come from

there is a decent chance apps as you know them will be mostly dead in ~5-10 years

and yes, there are some apps which will still require deep optimization and that is where the hardcore coders may still be needed. but machines will get better at that, and if you take one look at the AAA gaming landscape, you should understand that hyper-optimized code isn't as valuable as it used to be

but what will be valuable is owning the APIs with the most use and liquidity. and yes, a lot of those will use public blockchains

things are going to accelerate and get very weird very quickly from here
