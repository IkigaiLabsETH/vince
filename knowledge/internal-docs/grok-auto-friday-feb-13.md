=== GROK DAILY PULSE (AUTO) ===
Date: Friday, Feb 13 | Regime: neutral  
Fear & Greed: 9/100  
Top Traders: 56.3% long

**Prompt of the Day**: Screen BTC spot CVD vs. funding rates on 4H timeframe for divergence setups targeting 10% upside.

**Market Read**: Extreme fear at 9/100 signals capitulation, with neutral regime holding amid low vol. Top traders 56.3% long hints at contrarian bounce, but watch for macro FOMC echoes. BTC testing $95K support.

**Top 3 Research Ideas**:

1. BTC 100K calls (Mar exp) – buy on dip for 2x leverage if RSI <25.
2. ETH perp long (5x) – enter at $3.2K with 2% stop, trail on 1H highs.
3. HIP-3: SOL/BTC pair short perp if breaks 0.0025, target 0.0022 (0.5% risk).

**Knowledge Gap**: Quantify altcoin rotation signals using NVT ratio crossovers.
