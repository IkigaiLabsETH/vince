=== GROK DAILY PULSE (AUTO) ===
Date: Friday, Feb 13 | Regime: neutral  
Fear & Greed: 9/100  
Top Traders: 56.5% long  

**Prompt of the Day**  
Screen BTC perp funding rates across top exchanges; identify pairs with negative funding >0.05% for short bias entries.  

**Market Read**  
Extreme fear at 9/100 signals capitulation potential, but neutral regime and 56.5% trader longs suggest dip-buying resilience. BTC holds $95K support amid $2T crypto mcap dip; vol spikes on ETF outflows. Watch for reversal if greed ticks up.  

**Top 3 Research Ideas**  
1. BTC $92.5K puts (weekly expiry): Buy if vol >60%, target 20% premium decay.  
2. ETH perp shorts (3x lev): Enter at $3.2K resistance, stop $3.3K, trail on funding flip.  
3. HIP-3 long SOL/BTC pair: Allocate 2% at current ratio, exit on 5% drawdown or regime shift.  

**Knowledge Gap**  
Quantify HIP-3 edge in extreme fear (<20 F&G) vs neutral regimes with 2024-25 backtests.
