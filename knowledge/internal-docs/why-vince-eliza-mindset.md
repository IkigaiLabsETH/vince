# WHY we built VINCE and Eliza — the mindset

**Category:** internal-docs · **Tags:** vince, eliza, mindset, why, balance, lifestyle, making-it

This doc captures the human mindset behind the platform. It's why VINCE and Eliza exist: not to maximize screen time, but to stay in the game while living well.

## Why no one manages to leave

After hitting his number he took 6 months off—other games, friends, sports. The outside world (non-online) moved so slowly. Like 10 years behind. Online you get an insanely fast feedback loop; the frontier of humanity thrives here. Plus you get rewarded PnL-wise and get instant feedback from some of the smartest people on the internet. Very hard to leave.

## My path

The plan was to quit after the 2024 cycle. Plans changed. I spend 12+ hours daily in here already and can't see a full stop. This is what I'm good at (obviously way behind many OGs). As long as I enjoy it, why not keep doing it.

I told myself I'd quit at $1m. Got there in 2021. Now it's not about the sickest gains (I don't mind them). It's a game that's mentally stimulating and very competitive. I'll never be as great as many traders or DeFi degens on CT. As long as I enjoy it, can evolve, get better, and earn something from it, I'm fine with that.

## Making it / logging off

Making it means you can allocate your time much better to what you wish to do. For me: active things (tennis, surfing, snowboarding, working out) and intellectually stimulating things (chess, reading, language learning—4–5 lessons per week when I'm home).

I'm still passionate about crypto. Most of my energy and time over the past 6 years. Genuine interest in the innovation built here.

But crypto is like a cancer: you either cut it off or you have to try and treat it to live well. Very difficult to find balance. Hard to be passive. Many reasons to be bitter or frustrated if you log on every day.

## How I'm playing it now

Most of my net worth is in equities and more boring things—slow, conservative allocation over time. A portion in crypto (BTC/HYPE), adding at reasonable prices. No interest in chasing short PnLs or putting my lifestyle at risk with big bets.

I'm still not sure how I want to use this platform I've built. It took a lot of effort. There are a lot of people on here I appreciate. I believe I can contribute. I haven't struck a consistent balance that feels comfortable outside of mostly logging off.

## What fills the cup

The most rewarding things: sport, eating well, time in the sun, learning, travel, reading, being with genuine people. I cannot imagine allocating 12+ hours per day on screens, charts, or Twitter. I want to look back as an old man and be proud of how I spent my youth—not how many days I burned on microcap charts and Telegram chats.

## The advice (portfolio and time)

**Portfolio:** If you were all in cash right now, would you allocate your money the same way? If not, reassess.

**Time:** If you had a blank slate for a day or a week, would you allocate it the same way you spend each day or week?

Making it is about being in control of your time and allocating it toward what fills your cup—and enjoying the journey of finding out what those things are.

## Why VINCE and Eliza exist

We built this so we can **stay in the game** (informed, stimulated, some PnL, contributing) **without the cancer** of 12+ hours on screens.

- **VINCE** does the grinding: signals, paper bot, ALOHA, day report, trades and reasoning, close result, overall PnL. He pings you. You don't have to stare at charts and Telegram to stay sharp. You get the feedback loop and the edge without burning your youth on it.
- **Eliza** works the knowledge folder 24/7 and ingests what you send (YouTube, articles). You brainstorm with her; you suggest great content and she saves it. So the corpus grows and your thinking stays deep—without you having to be the one on screens 24/7 doing the research.

The goal isn't to quit crypto. It's to **treat it so we can live well**: stay in the game, evolve, earn, contribute—and still allocate the bulk of our time to sport, sun, learning, travel, reading, genuine people. VINCE and Eliza are the infrastructure for that balance.
