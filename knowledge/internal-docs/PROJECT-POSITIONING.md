# Project positioning — the macOS of autonomous agents

**We are working on the macOS of autonomous agents.**

Lots of people are. Ours is cuter and more degen. I think you'll like it.

## Milaidy

- **Repo:** https://github.com/milady-ai/milaidy  
- **Site:** https://milady.ai/  
- **Tagline:** terminally online · your cute personal AI · runs on your machine, always on, always yours.

Milaidy is a personal AI assistant built on ElizaOS—local, fast, single-user. When pitching the broader vision (VC/angels, demos, elevator pitch), this is the reference: we're building the approachable, degen-friendly layer on top of the agent stack.
