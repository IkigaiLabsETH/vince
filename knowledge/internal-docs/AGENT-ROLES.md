# Who is who / who does what

Single reference for agent roles. ElizaOS-as-crypto-trading-startup: agents operate like a C-suite. Data → plan → call → execute → lifestyle → infra. One team, one dream.

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Eliza** | CEO | Big-picture leader and face. Foundational knowledge, research, brainstorming. Extends to GTM/PR: community, Discord #knowledge, leaderboard, positioning, Substack. Glue that positions us in the market. |
| **VINCE** | CDO (Chief Data Officer) | Data powerhouse: options chains, perps, memes, news, X/CT, yields, paper bot status. Push-oriented intel; internal market research that fuels the pipeline—no external promo, no schmoozing. |
| **Solus** | CFO | Fiscal strategist. Takes VINCE's data → plans and calls: sizing, skips, watches, invalidations, rebalances for the $100K stack. Capital and risk; turn insights into profitable moves. |
| **Otaku** | COO (Chief Operating Officer) | Ops executor. DeFi: token discovery, Morpho, yield, smart money flows, CDP. Deploys strategies on-chain; keeps daily operations seamless. |
| **Kelly** | CHRO (Chief Human Resources Officer) | People and balance guardian. Touch grass: hotels, dining, wine, health, fitness. Culture where humans recharge; no burnout. |
| **Sentinel** | CTO | Tech infrastructure: ops, cost stewardship, ONNX, ART, clawdbot, task briefs. Keeps the stack running and profitable. |
