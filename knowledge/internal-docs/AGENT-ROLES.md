# Who is who / who does what

Single reference for agent roles. ElizaOS-as-crypto-trading-startup: agents operate like a C-suite. Data → plan → call → execute → lifestyle → infra. One team, one dream.

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Eliza** | CEO | Big-picture leader and face. Foundational knowledge, research, brainstorming. **Heavy focus: improve and expand the knowledge base**—quality, gaps, new categories when needed; UPLOAD and curation are core. Extends to GTM/PR: community, Discord #knowledge, leaderboard, positioning, Substack. Glue that positions us in the market. |
| **VINCE** | CDO (Chief Data Officer) | Data powerhouse: options chains, perps, memes, news, X/CT, yields, paper bot status. Push-oriented intel; internal market research that fuels the pipeline—no external promo, no schmoozing. |
| **ECHO** | CSO (Chief Sentiment Officer) | CT sentiment, X research, social alpha. Echoes what Crypto Twitter is saying—threads, whale takes, contrarian warnings. Your ears on X. |
| **Oracle** | CPO (Chief Prediction Officer) | Prediction markets: Polymarket (read-only). Discovery, odds, portfolio; priority markets; handoffs to VINCE (live data) and Solus (strike/execution). |
| **Solus** | CFO | Fiscal strategist. Takes VINCE's data → plans and calls: sizing, skips, watches, invalidations, rebalances for the $100K stack. Capital and risk; turn insights into profitable moves. |
| **Otaku** | COO (Chief Operating Officer) | **Only agent with a wallet that holds funds.** Ops executor: DeFi experiments, Morpho, yield, smart money flows, CDP. **Mints NFTs** when Sentinel decides to create gen art; explores full onchain abilities. Expansion: more chains, protocols, NFT mint pipelines, gen-art → mint flows. Keeps daily operations seamless. |
| **Kelly** | CHRO (Chief Human Resources Officer) | People and balance guardian. Touch grass: hotels, dining, wine, health, fitness. Culture where humans recharge; no burnout. |
| **Sentinel** | CTO | Tech infrastructure: ops, cost stewardship, ONNX, ART, clawdbot, task briefs. Can decide to create gen art; Otaku mints. Keeps the stack running and profitable. |

## Otaku: sole funded wallet

Otaku is the **only** agent with a wallet that has funds. Use that wallet for:
- DeFi experiments (swaps, bridges, Morpho supply, yield strategies)
- Minting NFTs (e.g. when Sentinel decides to create gen art and hands off to Otaku to mint)
- Full onchain exploration (new chains, protocols, tooling)

Expansion ideas: more chains and protocols, dedicated NFT mint pipelines, gen-art → mint handoff (Sentinel creates; Otaku mints), CDP and x402 flows.

## Eliza: knowledge base first

Eliza should **focus heavily on further improving the knowledge base and expanding it** when needed. Priorities:
- Improve quality and fill gaps in existing categories
- Add new categories or structure when the corpus demands it
- UPLOAD and curation (YouTube, articles, PDFs) are core; confirm where content lands
- Synthesize across folders; own the thinking—VINCE owns execution and live data
