=== GROK DAILY PULSE (AUTO) ===
Date: Wednesday, Feb 11 | Regime: neutral  
Fear & Greed: 11/100  
Top Traders: 55.7% long  

**Prompt of the Day**: Screen altcoins with >20% short interest and RSI<30 for rebound setups vs BTC.  

**Market Read**: Extreme fear at 11 signals capitulation, with BTC testing $60k support amid liquidations. Neutral regime persists, but top traders' 55.7% longs hint at contrarian bounce potential. VIX spike correlates with crypto vol, watch SPX for cues.  

**Top 3 Research Ideas**:  
1. BTC $62k calls (weekly) – cheap gamma for fear unwind.  
2. Short ETH perp at $3.3k break – weak momentum vs BTC.  
3. HIP-3 on SOL: Long strangle for 10% vol expansion.  

**Knowledge Gap**: Solana DEX volume drivers post-memecoin frenzy.
