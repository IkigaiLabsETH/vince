=== GROK DAILY PULSE (AUTO) ===
Date: Wednesday, Feb 11 | Regime: neutral  
Top Traders: 55.8% long

**Prompt of the Day**: Quantify BTC's implied vol skew vs realized vol on Deribit; flag arb setups if skew >15% divergence.

**Market Read**: BTC consolidates at $48.2K amid neutral regime, with 55.8% long bias from top traders signaling mild upside conviction. ETH lags at $2.6K, but altcoin rotation picks up as funding rates ease to +0.01%. VIX steady at 15.2 keeps risk-on flows intact short-term.

**Top 3 Research Ideas**:  
1. BTC $50K calls (Mar exp) if 1H RSI >65—target 20% OI buildup.  
2. Short ETH-PERP at $2.65K with 5x lev, trail stop below $2.6K support.  
3. HIP-3 on SOL: Enter long if $145 retest holds, exit at $160 (2:1 RR).

**Knowledge Gap**: HIP-3 backtest results in low-vol (IV<30%) neutral regimes.
