Top Traders: 54.2% long  

**Prompt of the Day**: Backtest BTC 4H RSI<30 entries with 2% stop-loss vs. current fear regime for perp long setups.  

**Market Read**: Extreme fear persists with Fear & Greed at 12, BTC holding $95K support amid neutral regime chop. Equities drag risk assets lower, but top traders' mild long bias signals potential bottoming. Altcoin bleed eases slightly on ETH ETF inflows.  

**Top 3 Research Ideas**:  
1. BTC $96K calls (weekly expiry) if 50-day EMA bounce—target 5% OI buildup.  
2. ETH-PERP long at $3.2K with 1:10 lev, trail stop below VWAP for 20% upside.  
3. HIP-3 on SOL: Enter if RSI divergence on 1H, exit at $220 resistance.
