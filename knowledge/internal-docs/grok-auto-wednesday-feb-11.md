=== GROK DAILY PULSE (AUTO) ===
Date: Wednesday, Feb 11 | Regime: neutral  
Fear & Greed: 11/100  
Top Traders: 55.8% long  

**Prompt of the Day**  
Quantify BTC's downside risk if Nasdaq drops 2% today—model with 1D options IV and perp funding.

**Market Read**  
Extreme fear at 11/100 signals capitulation potential, with BTC testing $42k support amid Nasdaq weakness. Neutral regime persists as top traders lean long (55.8%), but altcoins bleed 5-10%. Volume spikes on shorts suggest bounce setup if fear bottoms.

**Top 3 Research Ideas**  
1. BTC $44k calls (weekly expiry): Buy if holds $42k, target 10% upside on fear reversal.  
2. ETH perp long: Enter at $2.3k with 5x lev, trail stop at -2%, ride Nasdaq correlation.  
3. HIP-3 SOL short: 3-leg perp (short spot/long calls/short puts), skew for 15% vol crush.

**Knowledge Gap**  
Perp funding rate divergence in extreme fear vs. greed regimes.
