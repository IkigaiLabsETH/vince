=== GROK DAILY PULSE (AUTO) ===
Date: Wednesday, Feb 11 | Regime: neutral  
Fear & Greed: 11/100  
Top Traders: 56.0% long

**Prompt of the Day**  
Scan BTC/ETH funding rates + OI for perp squeeze setups targeting 5-10% moves by EOD.

**Market Read**  
Extreme fear (F&G 11) grips markets amid neutral regime, with BTC testing $42k support. Top traders lean 56% long, hinting at contrarian bounce potential despite high vol. Altcoins lag, amplifying downside risk.

**Top 3 Research Ideas**

1. BTC $43k calls (weekly): Buy on dip for fear capitulation play.
2. Short ETH-USD perps @ $2.3k resistance: Target 3% drop on weak funding.
3. HIP-3 SOL/BTC pair: Long if correlation breaks below 0.4, scale in 2x lev.

**Knowledge Gap**  
Options IV crush dynamics post-F&G extremes (<20).
