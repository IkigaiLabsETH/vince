## ◆ Origin & Context

Under **LIVETHELIFETV**, the path is clear: from refusing to sell hours ($100/hr in 1999 felt like winning until the trap became obvious) to building **LiveTheLife.TV** with Akamai and Apple—live, high-quality video before YouTube. Politics and funding shifts shelved it; the same billionaire later called it the biggest mistake of his life. Pattern recognition: being early is scar tissue. That continuity is the holding.

The same instinct led to pitching strangers-renting-homes in Palo Alto before Airbnb existed. Bitcoin hit in 2013: incorruptible money, math over trust. Bought after $10→$100, forced to sell at $200, watched $1,000 crash, then $20K in 2017. Maximum regret. True conviction at the $3K bottom. Bitcoin became the operating system: sovereignty, protest against fiat decay, a lifestyle, a protocol for freedom.

**IKIGAI STUDIO** started on [Substack](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/): that’s where we began underwriting our thesis, sharing market insights, and publishing lifestyle-related content. **IKIGAI LABS** is where we ship the product. Everything built now runs on conviction alone. No VCs. No permission. No exit. LIVETHELIFETV houses both: Studio cuts through the DeFi noise with no shilling, no hopium, no timing the market; Labs ships ClawTerm and the agents. Just battle-tested signal from someone who’s been early, wrong, hurt, and still standing.

## ◆ Executive Summary

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Under **LIVETHELIFETV**: **IKIGAI STUDIO** is thesis and content (Substack, essays, market insights, lifestyle). **IKIGAI LABS** is product and shipping (ClawTerm, agents, terminal, data stack). **CLAWTERM** is the crypto Bloomberg-style terminal—shipped by IKIGAI LABS as MVP on OpenClaw; the openclaw agent now drives ongoing improvement, with human oversight to review and merge PRs and polish work in Cursor with Claude 4.6.

The **core of the project** is the trading and data stack: a self-improving **paper perp trading bot** on **Hyperliquid**; **onchain options** on **Hypersurface** with a weekly decision—**covered calls vs secured puts**, and **which asset** (BTC, ETH, SOL, HYPE). That decision is data-heavy; we need a unified data and intelligence layer. ClawTerm is that layer. So: **core = terminal + paper bot + options ritual**; everything else supports or orbits that. Kelly is essential to inspire living the good life. Our principle—**One Team One Dream**—ties narrative, intel, finance, DeFi, wellness, and tech into a single coherent identity.

This brief defines the brand, voice, visual direction, and a **complete list of accounts to create** for the project (GitHub, Gmail, X, Google Calendar, and the rest) so every touchpoint speaks with one voice.

See [Voice & copy principles](#voice--copy-principles) below.                                                                                     |

### Voice & copy principles

Apply across **LIVETHELIFETV**, **IKIGAI LABS**, and **IKIGAI STUDIO**. When revising About pages, product descriptions, company bios, or any marketing copy, apply these principles so the result is polished, high-end, and on-brand.

**1. Benefit-led (Apple-style)**

Lead with what the user gets—the outcome, the experience, the move—not with features or specs. User-centric and aspirational. The goal is to make the copy emotionally resonant and value-first, so the reader thinks "this is for me."

- Avoid: _"Our app has advanced algorithms."_
- Prefer: _"Experience seamless productivity that lets you focus on what matters."_

**2. Confident and craft-focused (Porsche OG)**

Confident means a bold, assured tone: direct, unapologetic, authoritative. No hedging or filler ("we believe," "possibly"). Craft-focused means quality, precision, heritage, and meticulous attention to detail—like a master artisan's work. Porsche OG evokes the classic Porsche ethos: engineering excellence, timeless design, performance as a result of superior craftsmanship; premium, heritage-driven, self-assured.

- Example: _"Engineered with unrelenting precision for those who demand perfection."_

**3. Free of AI-slop jargon**

Strip generic, overused, or low-quality language often produced by AI tools. No buzzwords, hype without substance, or robotic filler. Keep copy fresh, human, and concise. No clichés or mass-produced feel.

Avoid (among others): leverage, utilize (use "use"), streamline, robust, cutting-edge, game-changer, synergy, paradigm, holistic, seamless, best-in-class, delve, landscape, certainly, great question, I'd be happy to, let me help, explore, dive into, unpack, nuanced, actionable, circle back, touch base, at the end of the day. Prefer concrete, human language only.

**Overall intent**

The result should be polished, high-end copy that's persuasive and brand-elevating—inspired by Apple (simplicity, user focus) and Porsche (craft, exclusivity)—and should never read like generic AI output. Ideal for About pages, product descriptions, and marketing materials where standing out matters.

### ClawTerm: product vision

**Tagline:** _The AI-Powered Crypto Bloomberg Terminal – Built for the Onchain Era_

Imagine a world where institutional-grade crypto intelligence isn't locked behind a $25,000 annual Bloomberg subscription or scattered across 20 fragmented tools (Dune, Nansen, Glassnode, DexScreener, Twitter). Where you don't need to be a SQL wizard or 24/7 alpha hunter to stay ahead. That's **ClawTerm**—the open-source, AI-native Crypto Terminal we're building on OpenClaw.

- **The problem:** Fragmentation (dashboards for onchain, charts, portfolios, trading, sentiment). Accessibility gap: pro tools expensive or complex; retail misses edges. Reactivity over autonomy—you react to alerts instead of your terminal proactively hunting opportunities.
- **The solution:** ClawTerm on OpenClaw. **Conversational intelligence** ("Give me a full market digest on Solana," "Is this token legit? Scan 0x... on Base," "DCA $500 into ETH over the next week on Hyperliquid"). **Unified dashboard:** real-time onchain metrics, portfolio tracking, live charts, news/sentiment, prediction markets. **Autonomous agents:** sub-agents that run 24/7—alpha scanning, whale monitoring, trading signals, token launches (Bankr/Clanker), bridging. **DeFi superpowers:** one-click swaps, yield, leverage, onchain identity; extensible (3,000+ community skills), self-hosted, vetted (ClawdStrike, VirusTotal).
- **Why now:** Agents are the killer app of 2026. Crypto needs intelligence that's proactive, not reactive. Democratization: open-source, free to run, Bloomberg-level power in every trader's hands. Edge: natural language + autonomy = faster decisions.

We're not just building another dashboard. We're creating the definitive onchain intelligence layer—the Bloomberg Terminal crypto always deserved.

**Who builds it (ship and evolution)**

- **Shipped:** IKIGAI LABS shipped ClawTerm as the MVP—the crypto Bloomberg-style terminal on OpenClaw.
- **Evolution:** The openclaw agent now drives ongoing improvement (code, features, fixes). Humans provide oversight: review and merge PRs, and polish work in Cursor with Claude 4.6. Agent grinding + human gatekeeping and quality.

**The terminal is open. What's your first query?** · **ikigailabs.eth** · **Built on OpenClaw** · 2026 and beyond.

_Where to read more:_ [plugin-vince README](../src/plugins/plugin-vince/README.md) (paper bot), [SOLUS_NORTH_STAR.md](SOLUS_NORTH_STAR.md) (strike ritual, options), [NORTH_STAR_DELIVERABLES.md](../knowledge/sentinel-docs/NORTH_STAR_DELIVERABLES.md) (perps + options deliverables).

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## ◆ Target Audience

- **Primary:** Traders and builders who need unified crypto data, paper perp context, and the weekly options ritual (covered calls vs secured puts, asset choice). They want a Bloomberg-like terminal, not 20 fragmented tools.
- **Secondary:** Lifestyle and wellness (Kelly), capital pathways (Solus), coders and ops (Sentinel), media/cinema (LIVETHELIFETV heritage).
- **Pain Points:** Noise, shilling, FOMO; fragmented data, no single terminal. We provide clarity, thesis, agent-backed execution, and unified intelligence.
- **Channels:** [Substack](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/) for long-form; X for real-time; Discord/Telegram for community and agents.

### Accounts and API keys (from .env.example)

The project’s **`.env.example`** implies **developer/API accounts** you’ll need in addition to the brand accounts above. Create or claim these so the stack can use them (keys go in `.env` or agent secrets). Use **IKIGAI STUDIO** / **IKIGAI LABS** or ikigaistudio / ikigailabs where the platform allows a project/org name (under LIVETHELIFETV).

**Multi-agent Discord:** Each agent (Eliza, VINCE, Solus, Otaku, Kelly, Sentinel) needs its **own** Discord application (Application ID + Bot token). Create one app per agent at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set the matching `*_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` and `*_DISCORD_API_TOKEN`. See DISCORD.md for channel layout.

**Suggested order to create API accounts:** (1) One model provider (OpenAI or Anthropic). (2) Supabase (project + Postgres + optional Storage bucket `vince-ml-models`). (3) Discord app(s) for the agents you run. (4) X Developer (Basic or higher) if you use X research/sentiment. (5) Tavily for web search. (6) Crypto/data APIs as you enable features (Birdeye, Helius, Alchemy, etc.). Store keys in 1Password/Bitwarden (vault “IKIGAI STUDIO” or “LIVETHELIFETV”) or in `.env` (never commit `.env`).

### Ideas from sentinel-docs (knowledge/sentinel-docs)

The **sentinel-docs** folder (`knowledge/sentinel-docs`), **MULTI_AGENT.md**, and **DISCORD.md** (in docs/) are the main references for Sentinel, multi-agent behavior, Discord layout, and integration ideas. **Discord server layouts** under the holding: **LiveTheLifeTV** (holding/C-suite, lifestyle focus) and **IKIGAI LABS** (VINCE Command Center, product)—see [DISCORD.md](DISCORD.md) for full channel lists and push routing. Below are concepts that can inform **accounts**, **tools**, and **roadmap**—not a duplicate of the rest of BRANDING, but a pointer to where to look.

## ◆ Visual Identity (Aligned with Frontend)

Product UI (VINCE frontend) defines the in-app system. Marketing and social can layer **ETH blue and gold** or a restrained, editorial palette for Substack and X.

### Color Palette (Product / App)

Defined in `src/frontend/index.css` (OKLCH). Dark mode default.

| Role            | Light                        | Dark (default)                | Usage               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Background**  | `oklch(1 0 0)`               | `oklch(0.2029 0.0037 345.62)` | Page, panels, cards |
| **Foreground**  | `oklch(0.145 0 0)`           | `oklch(0.9851 0 0)`           | Primary text        |
| **Primary**     | `oklch(0.205 0 0)`           | `oklch(0.4703 0.2364 263.19)` | CTAs, links         |
| **Muted**       | `oklch(0.97 0 0)`            | `oklch(0.2393 0 0)`           | Secondary surfaces  |
| **Success**     | `oklch(0.7775 0.2447 144.9)` | same                          | Positive, returns   |
| **Warning**     | `oklch(0.769 0.188 70.08)`   | same                          | Alerts              |
| **Destructive** | `oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)`  | `oklch(0.5961 0.2006 36.48)`  | Errors              |

**Approximate hex (dark):** Background ~`#1f1d1e`–`#1a1a1d`, foreground ~`#fafafa`, primary ~`#6d66e8`.

### Typography (Product / App)

| Use                     | Font            | Notes                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Display / Headlines** | **Rebels**      | Sharp, technical, cinematic. |
| **Body / UI / Code**    | **Roboto Mono** | Clear data and body text.    |

### Imagery & Logo

- Directed, crafted visuals—no stock slop. Agent avatars, blockchain data as framed visuals, lifestyle (surf, focus, real food).
- Logo: Venn refined to film-reel or node network; Eliza as illumination, Sentinel as defense. “IKIGAI STUDIO” wordmark for Substack and social.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## ◆ Digital Presence (Handles & Copy)

### X (Twitter)

- **Handle:** @IkigaiStudio (or @ikigaistudio if available).
- **Bio:** _“Thesis, market insights, lifestyle. No hype, no shilling. From [ikigaistudio.substack.com](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/) · One Team One Dream.”_
- **Pin:** Substack link or latest thesis thread. Optional product pin: _"ClawTerm: the crypto Bloomberg. Built on OpenClaw. ikigailabs.eth"_

### Email

- **Main:** ikigaistudio@gmail.com
- **Official:** hello@ikigaistudio.com (once domain is live)

### Substack

- **Already:** [ikigaistudio.substack.com](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/)
- **Description:** _“Dive into the crypto trenches with unfiltered, front-row access—no hype, just hard-hitting analysis on Bitcoin, curated altcoins, macro trends, stocks, and lifestyle insights. Zeroed in on forward-thinking strategies across finance and beyond.”_

### Social one-liner (reusable)

_“IKIGAI STUDIO — Thesis & market insights from the trenches. Bitcoin, macro, lifestyle. No VCs, no permission. [Substack](https://ikigaistudio.substack.com/) · One Team One Dream.”_

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## ◆ Key Messaging & Content

### Core Messages

- **“No hype. No shilling. No timing the market.”** — Default stance in every channel.
- **“Battle-tested signal from someone who’s been early, wrong, hurt, and still standing.”** — Origin story in one line.
- **“Thesis first. Underwritten on Substack. Executed by agents.”** — Flow from idea to system.
- **ClawTerm:** "The AI-Powered Crypto Bloomberg Terminal. Built for the onchain era. The terminal is open."
- **Core vs inspiration:** The core is the terminal and the trading ritual—paper perps on Hyperliquid, options on Hypersurface, every Friday. Kelly and the team inspire the life around it.

### Content Strategy

- **Substack:** Long-form thesis, market insights, lifestyle; anchor of the brand.
- **X:** Short takes, threads, agent teasers, replies; drive to Substack and Discord.
- **Agents:** VINCE (intel), Solus (finance), Kelly (lifestyle), Sentinel (tech)—all under LIVETHELIFETV (IKIGAI STUDIO content, IKIGAI LABS product).

## ◆ Next Steps & Budget

| Item             | Target                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approval**     | Confirm holding and brand structure (LIVETHELIFETV, IKIGAI STUDIO, IKIGAI LABS) and account list by February 15, 2026. |
| **Secure first** | Gmail, X handle, GitHub org, domain (ikigaistudio.com), ENS (ikigaistudio.eth).                                        |
| **Then**         | Google Calendar, Discord, Telegram, custom email, Figma, Notion.                                                       |
| **Metrics**      | Substack subs; X followers and engagement; Discord/Telegram growth.                                                    |
| **Budget**       | ~$2K (domain, design, tools); expand with onchain revenue (e.g. Otaku/morpho_yield).                                   |

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## ◆ Hardware & mobility

**Primary machine:** A **brand new Mac mini** runs the full stack (ElizaOS, VINCE, agents, Discord bots, Supabase-backed persistence, local dev). Single dedicated machine keeps the project consistent and easy to back up or replicate.

**Dedicated 2FA and mobility:** An **iPad mini** is assigned **only** to this project. It serves as:

- **2FA device** for accounts that require it (Gmail, GitHub, Discord, X, Supabase, API providers, etc.). No mixing with personal devices—all LIVETHELIFETV / IKIGAI second factors live on one device.
- **Road-trip capable:** With the iPad mini, you can approve logins, check Discord/Substack, or handle 2FA prompts from anywhere. The project stays mobile without moving the Mac mini.

Keep the iPad mini signed into the same Apple ID used for the project (or a dedicated one), with auth apps (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password) and any “trusted device” prompts for LIVETHELIFETV / IKIGAI accounts. Store nothing else on it so it stays a clean, project-only 2FA and lightweight control surface.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## ◆ Software with strong free tiers

For the **entire team** (Eliza, VINCE, Solus, Otaku, Kelly, Sentinel)—docs, ops, design, hosting, analytics, automation—these tools offer **generous free tiers** and are commonly used by agent/Cursor/clawdbot-style workflows. Sign up with **IKIGAI STUDIO** (content) or **IKIGAI LABS** (product) / ikigaistudio / ikigailabs as appropriate under LIVETHELIFETV.

_Context: [Clawd/OpenClaw](https://docs.clawd.bot/tools) users often rely on Notion, Obsidian, Trello, GitHub, and productivity integrations; Cursor users pair with Notion MCP for docs. The list below fits a multi-agent dev + content + ops stack._

### Clawdbot/OpenClaw: most discussed tools (for reference)

Across setup guides, tutorials, GitHub, and community (X, Reddit, tech blogs), **Clawdbot/OpenClaw** users most often talk about the following. Many have strong free tiers or are self-hosted. Use this as a checklist for “what else could we plug in?” — especially if you add clawdbot-style knowledge research or sub-agents later.

| Category                           | Most discussed                                                                                                                             | Why they’re popular                                                                                                                              | Our stack alignment                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Setup order (community pattern):** Start with **Telegram (or Discord) + Claude + Google Calendar + Gmail** for quick wins → add **Notion/Todoist** for productivity → then **GitHub / Home Assistant / skills** for power use.

**Pro tips from the community:** Use a **VPS** (e.g. Fly.io, already in our list) for 24/7 agent access; lock down **permissions** and **secrets** (1Password or env vault); **start small** so the agent isn’t overwhelmed; check **awesome-openclaw-skills** (or equivalent) for plug-and-play skills.

**Even more niche and advanced (ClawHub / awesome-openclaw-skills)**  
ClawHub and curated lists (e.g. awesome-openclaw-skills) host thousands of skills. The following are frequently discussed for **security**, **DeFi/onchain**, **multi-agent**, and **research** — most relevant to our stack. Only add if they clearly serve a lane; vet everything (see caution below).

| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security & auditing**    | VirusTotal/clawsec, OpenGuardrails/MoltGuard, GGShield (secret leak scan), Skill-Vetter/Secure-Install, Heimdall-Security                                      | **Sentinel** and safe installs: scan skills for malware, block prompt injection, hunt leaked API keys; vet skills before adding to any agent.                   |
| **DeFi / onchain**         | Bankr/Clanker, ERC-8004/OnchainKit, Hyperliquid API, Zapper                                                                                                    | **Otaku** (funded wallet, yield, perps): token launches, portfolio tracking, perp trading; we already use HL and data — these extend execution/identity.        |

| **Research & domain**      | Arxiv-Watcher, Patent-Validator/Patent-Scanner, PrivateDeepSearch (OSINT)                                                                                      | **Eliza** (knowledge, research): paper summaries, prior-art checks, deep search for thesis and competitive intel.                                               |
| **Media / health / other** | Sora-Video-Gen/Veo, Clonev/Chichi-Speech, Podcast-Generation; Oura/Whoop/Dexcom/Garmin-Health; CAD-Agent/Algorithmic-Art; stealth browsers, desktop automation | Optional: voice/video for Kelly or content; health wearables for lifestyle; 3D/generative art for Sentinel’s ART lane; browser/desktop only in isolated setups. |

**Caution:** The community reports **malicious skills** (e.g. credential stealers) in public registries. Always **vet** with security suites (VirusTotal, GGShield), sandbox untrusted skills, and run experimental stacks in **isolated envs** (VMs, separate VPS). Multi-skill stacks are powerful but increase attack surface.

**Home automation & IoT (OpenClaw)**  
Smart Home & IoT is one of the strongest OpenClaw categories (56+ skills on ClawHub / awesome-openclaw-skills). **Home Assistant** is the main hub—skills like `home-assistant`, `moltbot-ha`, `hass-cli` let an agent control any HA device (Zigbee/Z-Wave, Matter/Thread, thousands of integrations). There is an official OpenClaw add-on for Home Assistant. In early 2026 **SwitchBot** gained official support (curtains, bots, hubs). _Only add if you run OpenClaw/clawdbot and want agent-driven home control; otherwise skip._

| Area                      | Examples (skills / devices)                                     | Idea                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lighting & ambiance**   | Philips Hue/OpenHue, Govee, Nanoleaf, WLED, IKEA Dirigera, Kasa | AI-driven scenes (movie mode, focus mode from calendar/Notion); lights pulse during agent “thinking.”               |
| **Climate & air**         | Tado, Netatmo, ecobee, Sensibo, Midea AC, Dyson                 | Room-by-room temp; combine with weather for pre-heat/cool; “arrival home” pre-adjust + purifier.                    |
| **Cleaning**              | Roborock                                                        | “Clean kitchen after dinner”; auto-vacuum when presence says away; map/dirt summaries.                              |
| **Security & monitoring** | Frigate NVR, Nest, SwitchBot locks/plugs                        | Object detection (package, person, anomaly); nightly sweep—lock doors, arm cameras, announce via VoiceMonkey/Alexa. |
| **Kitchen & appliances**  | LG ThinQ, Anova                                                 | Laundry/fridge alerts; recipe-guided cooking; “dinner prep” (sous vide + oven + notify).                            |
| **Entertainment & audio** | Google TV/Chromecast, Sonos, VoiceMonkey                        | Cast by mood; multi-room; announcements (“dinner in 10 min,” visitor alerts).                                       |
| **Outdoor & vehicle**     | Tesla Fleet API, MyQ garage, Starlink                           | Precondition EV, open garage; Starlink reboot if slow; “leaving home” routine (lock, pause vacuum, eco thermostat). |
| **Niche / DIY**           | MQTT, Homey, Homebridge, Eight Sleep                            | DIY sensors (e.g. plants); bridge non-HA devices; Eight Sleep + wearables for sleep/wake + lights/music.            |

**Security (home automation):** In early 2026, **ClawHavoc** saw hundreds of malicious skills on ClawHub. Use **trusted sources only** (e.g. awesome-openclaw-skills), security skills (virustotal-security, security-suite, securityclaw), and **isolate** (dedicated VM or HA add-on).

**Pro tips:** Start with **home-assistant** or **moltbot-ha** + HA add-on for broadest control. Use sub-agents or scheduling for proactive “home status” (temps, security, energy) via WhatsApp/Telegram. Combine weather + climate, calendar + presence, Frigate + notifications. **EU/French focus:** Tado, Netatmo, IKEA, SwitchBot have strong support. These turn OpenClaw from reactive commands into autonomous home management—experiment safely and vet every skill.

**Suggested sign-up order (after core accounts):** Notion or Obsidian → Linear → Figma → Vercel (if not yet) → Plausible or Clarity → Cal.com → Zapier or n8n if you need automation. Add **Gmail**, **Todoist**, **1Password** (or Bitwarden) from the Clawdbot list if you want inbox, task list, and secret management. Add the rest as the team grows.

## ◆ Free accounts for the agents (by lane)

Each agent is good at something specific and produces outputs that deserve a **home**—a place to read from, write to, or trigger. Creating the right free accounts _for them_ (not just for humans) makes those outputs visible, shareable, and automatable. Below: what each agent is good at, what they produce, and which free accounts to create so they can use or feed those tools.

| She’s good at                                                                                     | She produces                                                                                                         | Free accounts to create for her                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Improving and expanding the knowledge base; research; brainstorm; GTM/positioning; Substack voice | Essays (→ Substack), tweet suggestions, long-form X articles; ingestion into `knowledge/`; Leaderboard Knowledge tab | **Substack** (IKIGAI STUDIO — already exists): publish essays from `standup-deliverables/essays/`. **Notion** (workspace or “Eliza” area): mirror knowledge summaries, content pipeline, so Cursor/Notion MCP can pull; or **Obsidian** vault for second-brain + backlinks. **Discord** #knowledge: ingestion channel (already). Optionally **Airtable** or **Notion DB**: “Content calendar” (essays, tweets, x-articles) so every deliverable has a row. |

### VINCE — Data, push, paper bot

| He’s good at                                                                                | He produces                                                                                                    | Free accounts to create for him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Options, perps, memes, news, X/CT, paper bot status, yield; ALOHA vibe check; push not pull | Daily report (ALOHA), PERPS/OPTIONS pulse, suggested trades (`standup-deliverables/trades/`), Leaderboard data | **Discord/Slack** (already): primary push. **Notion DB or Airtable**: “VINCE report archive” — optional table where each ALOHA or trade suggestion is a row (date, summary, link to thread) for search and review. **Zapier or n8n** (free tier): forward ALOHA or daily report to Notion/email/calendar. **Supabase** (already): feature store + leaderboard backend; no extra account. Optionally **Metabase** or **Retool** (free tier): read-only dashboard on top of Supabase for “VINCE by the numbers” if you want a dedicated analytics view. |

### Solus — Plan and call, $100K stack

| He’s good at                                                                                               | He produces                                                                         | Free accounts to create for him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Size/skip/watch, invalidation, rebalance; execution architect; same content lane as Eliza (essays, tweets) | Plans and calls; north-star essays/tweets when standup assigns him; execution notes | **Notion DB or Airtable**: “Solus call log” — date, asset, direction, size/skip/watch, invalidation level, one-line rationale; human or agent can append. **Google Calendar** (IKIGAI STUDIO): calendar “Solus” or “Rebalance” — recurring or one-off events for “rebalance window,” “invalidation check,” so Solus’s cadence is visible. **Substack/X**: byline for essays/tweets (same as Eliza; one brand). |

### Otaku — DeFi, wallet, NFTs

| He’s good at                                                                                                 | He produces                             | Free accounts to create for him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Token discovery, Morpho, yield, CDP; mints NFTs when Sentinel creates gen art; only agent with funded wallet | Onchain actions; mints; portfolio moves | **Notion DB or Airtable**: “Otaku mint log” / “Otaku moves” — date, chain, action (mint, deposit, harvest), link to tx or OpenSea; accountability and narrative. **OpenSea / Zora** (or similar): use existing or create **IKIGAI STUDIO** collection or profile so “Otaku’s mints” have a public gallery. **Google Calendar**: “Otaku” — yield harvest or rebalance reminders if time-based. **DeFi dashboards** (DeBank, Zapper, etc.): often free API or read-only; no need for a separate “account” but one login for the org to view portfolio. |

### Kelly — Lifestyle, good life, touch grass

Essential for inspiration; the product core is data and the trading ritual. Kelly inspires living the life—hotels, dining, wine, touch grass—while the brand face is the terminal and the Friday options ritual.

| She’s good at                                                                                               | She produces                                                                                                                                          | Free accounts to create for her                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Hotels, fine dining, wine, health, fitness; KELLY_DAILY_BRIEFING; allowlist places, the-good-life knowledge | Daily briefing to Discord; good-life suggestions (`standup-deliverables/good-life/`); picks from `knowledge/the-good-life` and `allowlist-places.txt` | **Notion board or Airtable**: “Kelly’s picks” / “Allowlist places” — one row per place (name, city, type, notes, tried Y/N); she suggests, human checks off; can sync or mirror `allowlist-places.txt`. **Google Calendar**: “Kelly” — wine tastings, restaurant reservations, “touch grass” blocks. **Substack** (IKIGAI STUDIO): optional “Kelly’s picks” section or occasional lifestyle post. **OpenTable / Resy** (if free API or affiliate): account for booking links in briefings (optional). |

### Sentinel — Ops, cost, PRDs, clawdbot, ART

| He’s good at                                                                                                                                | He produces                                                                                                                                                                                | Free accounts to create for him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Ops, architecture, cost steward (TREASURY); ONNX status; clawdbot/knowledge research; ART gems; task briefs for Claude 4.6; PRDs for Cursor | PRDs (`standup-deliverables/prds/`), Milaidy/OpenClaw instructions (`standup-deliverables/integration-instructions/`), cost summary (SENTINEL_COST_STATUS), weekly/daily digest to Discord | **Linear** (or **Jira**): project “IKIGAI STUDIO” — create issues from PRDs (manual paste or future API); Sentinel’s output becomes the backlog. **Notion**: “Sentinel” area — PRD index, cost summary page (or link to TREASURY), clawdbot runbook; Cursor + Notion MCP can read. **GitHub**: repo e.g. `standup-deliverables` or `prds` (optional) so PRDs live in version control and Cursor can open them. **Obsidian** (optional): vault for clawdbot output and knowledge-research notes so Sentinel’s “research” has a home. **Discord** (already): sentinel/ops channels for weekly and daily digest. |
