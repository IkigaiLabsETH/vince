# Recent Shipments and GitHub Sources

Reference for Sentinel: what shipped recently and where to check for the latest closed PRs and OpenClaw fork activity.

## Recent Shipments (Last Few Days)

**Otaku agent (src/agents/otaku.ts):**
- Plugins now loaded: SQL, Bootstrap, OpenAI (optional), Web Search (optional), CDP, Morpho (when CDP), Relay (when CDP + RELAY_API_KEY), **Biconomy/MEE** (when CDP + BICONOMY_API_KEY — gasless cross-chain swaps/rebalance), **DefiLlama** (always — protocol TVL, GET_PROTOCOL_TVL, GET_YIELD_RATES), Bankr (when BANKR_API_KEY), Etherscan (optional).
- **Not loaded:** Clanker (redundant with Bankr for token launch on Base + Solana), CoinGecko (execution/quote from Relay/Bankr/Nansen; Hyperliquid preferred elsewhere).
- OTAKU.md updated with full plugin-loading notes.

**plugin-relay:** Type fix in RelayService.initialize: apiKey from runtime.getSetting normalized to string | undefined to fix TS 2322.

**Bankr:** Token launch is first-class ("deploy a token called X on base" / "launch a token on solana" via BANKR_AGENT_PROMPT). We are Bankr-first; Clanker kept only if a direct Base SDK path is needed.

**Standup/PRD:** docs/standup/prds/2026-02-12-prd-v2-1-0-release-notes-sentinel-eliza-upgrades.md — v2.1.0 release notes (Sentinel + Eliza upgrades).
