# Airdrop Decision Framework

## Context

Airdrop farming is fundamentally a portfolio allocation problem. You have limited time and capital, and must decide:

1. Which projects to farm
2. How much effort to allocate to each
3. What specific actions to take
4. How to manage risk across many protocols

The key insight is that **most airdrops are not worth farming**. Your goal is to identify the top 20-30 opportunities and concentrate on the top 5-10.

## Core Framework: H/E/F/S Scoring

Every airdrop opportunity can be evaluated on four dimensions:

| Dimension                | What It Measures                         | Scoring                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **H** (Hype)             | Community buzz, attention, visibility    | 1-10: 10 = everyone talking about it |
| **E** (Expected)         | Likelihood of airdrop actually happening | 1-10: 10 = confirmed/certain         |
| **F** (Farming Priority) | Effort vs reward efficiency              | 1-10: 10 = low effort, high reward   |
| **S** (Size)             | Potential dollar value of airdrop        | 1-10: 10 = life-changing money       |

### How to Use the Score

**Calculate aggregate:** (H + E + F + S) / 4

**Decision matrix:**

| Aggregate | Action            | Time Investment                     |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 7-10      | Full farming      | Daily activity, significant capital |
| 5-6       | Moderate farming  | Weekly activity, moderate capital   |
| 3-4       | Minimal footprint | 3-10 actions total, move on         |
| 1-2       | Skip or waitlist  | No active farming                   |

### Scoring Examples

**High-value opportunity (score 8+):**

- H: 9 (everyone in CT talking about it)
- E: 8 (confirmed points system)
- F: 8 (simple actions, clear rewards)
- S: 7 (large VC backing, no token yet)
- Aggregate: 8.0 → Full farming

**Mid-tier opportunity (score 5-6):**

- H: 6 (known project, moderate buzz)
- E: 6 (likely airdrop, not confirmed)
- F: 5 (some effort required)
- S: 5 (moderate size expected)
- Aggregate: 5.5 → Weekly activity

**Low-priority (score 3-4):**

- H: 4 (limited awareness)
- E: 5 (might happen)
- F: 3 (high effort, unclear reward)
- S: 3 (small or uncertain)
- Aggregate: 3.75 → Minimal footprint only

## Application: Action Templates by Category

Once you've scored a project, use the appropriate action template:

### Chains (L1/L2)

- 30-100 transactions over 6-12 weeks
- Bridge in from multiple sources
- Use 3-7 different dapps
- Deploy a simple contract once
- Keep some native token in wallet

### DeFi Protocols

- Deposit meaningful amount
- Swap multiple times
- LP for 7-30 days
- Borrow and repay at least once
- Repeat core actions weekly

### Perp DEXes

- Deposit collateral
- Execute 20-80 trades
- Spread volume across pairs
- Maintain balance in account
- Hit volume tier if applicable

### Social/Identity

- Complete full profile
- Verify all credentials
- Daily actions (post, engage)
- Referrals if tracked
- Use all core features

### DePIN

- Uptime is everything
- Run node/app continuously
- Complete all available tasks
- Maintain consistent operation

## Signals and Patterns

**Strong airdrop signals:**

- Points system launched
- Testnet with achievements
- "Season 1" terminology
- Large VC raise, no token
- Competitor just did airdrop

**Timing patterns:**

- Testnets 3-6 months before mainnet
- Points campaigns 1-3 months before TGE
- Airdrop usually within 1-2 weeks of announcement
- Season ends often trigger drops

**Distribution patterns:**

- Linear: Rewards proportional to activity
- Tiered: Step functions at thresholds
- Lottery: Random selection among qualifiers
- Hybrid: Mix of the above

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-farming low-tier projects**
   - Fix: Score everything, concentrate on top tier

2. **All actions in one day**
   - Fix: Spread 3-5 actions over 2-6 weeks

3. **Ignoring wallet hygiene**
   - Fix: Segment wallets by risk level

4. **Chasing every new project**
   - Fix: Maintain focus list, evaluate new ones monthly

5. **Not tracking what you've done**
   - Fix: Simple spreadsheet of wallet, project, status

6. **Forgetting to claim**
   - Fix: Set reminders for known drop dates

## Risk Management

### Wallet Strategy

```
Main Wallet: NEVER touches farms
├── Only holds core assets
├── Used for large value transfers
└── Maximum security

Farm Wallet(s): Daily farming
├── Acceptable loss if compromised
├── Can use multiple for different tiers
└── Regular but not maximum security

High-Risk Wallet: Sketchy protocols
├── Assume it will get drained
├── Minimal funds
└── Used for unaudited/new protocols
```

### Capital Allocation

- Never allocate more than you can afford to lose
- Gas costs should not exceed 10% of expected value
- Locked capital opportunity cost matters

## Conclusion

- H/E/F/S scoring systematically ranks opportunities
- Match effort to score: full farming for 7+, minimal for 3-4
- Use category-specific action templates
- Wallet hygiene prevents catastrophic losses
- Most airdrops aren't worth it - focus on the top tier
