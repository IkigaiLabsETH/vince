## Methodology & Framework

**Core Analytical Approach:**
- Treat airdrop farming as a venture capital portfolio: Allocate limited time and capital to a diversified set of 20-30 projects, concentrating efforts on the top 5-10 based on systematic evaluation.
- Employ H/E/F/S scoring as a multi-dimensional framework to assess opportunities objectively, balancing hype, expectation, efficiency, and potential scale.
- Match effort levels to aggregated scores: High scores warrant intensive engagement, while lower ones suggest minimal or no action to optimize resource allocation.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Identify strong signals like points systems, testnet achievements, or "Season 1" phrasing as indicators of impending airdrops.
- Recognize timing patterns, such as testnets preceding mainnet launches or points campaigns leading to token generation events.
- Spot distribution models (linear, tiered, lottery, or hybrid) to anticipate reward structures and adjust participation accordingly.
- Detect red flags including overhyped discussions, unclear revenue paths, excessive KYC, or communication delays to avoid low-value pursuits.

**Decision Criteria:**
- Gate-check viability: Only proceed if the project has credible funding/team, airdrop signals, and accessible interactions; otherwise, skip or waitlist.
- Determine effort intensity via H/E/F/S aggregate: Full for 7+, moderate for 5-6, minimal for 3-4, and none for below 3.
- Select actions using category-specific templates (e.g., chains, DeFi, perps) to ensure durable, spread-out engagement without over-concentration.
- Incorporate risk considerations: Segment wallets by exposure level, limit capital to affordable losses, and factor in opportunity costs.

**Risk Assessment Methods:**
- Segment wallets hierarchically: Main for core assets (no farming), farm wallets for standard activities, and high-risk for unaudited protocols.
- Evaluate capital efficiency: Ensure gas and locked funds don't exceed a small fraction of expected value.
- Monitor common pitfalls like over-farming or poor tracking through monthly re-evaluations and simple record-keeping.

**Application Guidelines:**
- Apply frameworks timelessly: Re-score projects periodically as conditions evolve, focusing on qualitative signals over transient data.
- Use for strategic filtering: Narrow from broad opportunities to focused tiers, automating lower ones while actively managing high-potentials.

## Methodology and Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Airdrops reward early users, but most are not worth farming
- Use H/E/F/S scoring to systematically evaluate opportunities
- Minimal footprint beats over-farming (quality over quantity)
- Wallet hygiene prevents cross-contamination of risk

**Analytical Approach:**
- Think of airdrop farming as venture capital: most fail, few pay big
- Score opportunities systematically, don't chase hype alone
- Match effort to expected value, not excitement
- Diversify across 20-30 projects, concentrate on top 5

**Decision Framework:**

1. **Should I farm this at all?** (Gate check)
   - Is it a real project with funding/team? If no → skip
   - Is there any airdrop signal (points, testnet, hints)? If no → skip
   - Is the project live enough to interact with? If no → waitlist only
   
2. **How much effort?** (H/E/F/S scoring)
   - Calculate aggregate score: (H + E + F + S) / 4
   - Score 7+: Full farming (daily activity, significant capital)
   - Score 5-6: Moderate farming (weekly activity, moderate capital)
   - Score 3-4: Minimal footprint (3-10 actions, move on)
   - Score 1-2: Skip or waitlist only

3. **What actions?** (Template selection)
   - Match project category to action template
   - Never do 200 micro-actions in one day
   - Spread 3-5 durable actions over 2-6 weeks

4. **Which wallet?** (Risk segmentation)
   - Main wallet: Never touches farms
   - Farm wallet: Standard farms (can use multiple)
   - High-risk wallet: Sketchy or unaudited protocols

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Projects that delay airdrop announcements often have larger drops
- Testnet participation usually matters more than mainnet for new chains
- Identity/social projects reward profile completion heavily
- VC-backed projects with no token yet = strong airdrop signal

**Red Flags:**
- Airdrop hunters openly discussing (usually means over-farmed)
- Project with no clear path to revenue (token may be worthless)
- Excessive KYC requirements (may exclude you later)
- Repeated airdrop delays without communication

**Important Notes:**
- H/E/F/S scores are subjective - use as framework, not gospel
- Aggregate lists get stale fast - re-evaluate monthly
- Focus on your active tier, let the rest run on autopilot

# Airdrop Decision Framework

## Context

Airdrop farming is fundamentally a portfolio allocation problem. You have limited time and capital, and must decide:
1. Which projects to farm
2. How much effort to allocate to each
3. What specific actions to take
4. How to manage risk across many protocols

The key insight is that **most airdrops are not worth farming**. Your goal is to identify the top 20-30 opportunities and concentrate on the top 5-10.

## Core Framework: H/E/F/S Scoring

Every airdrop opportunity can be evaluated on four dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Measures | Scoring |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **H** (Hype) | Community buzz, attention, visibility | 1-10: 10 = everyone talking about it |
| **E** (Expected) | Likelihood of airdrop actually happening | 1-10: 10 = confirmed/certain |
| **F** (Farming Priority) | Effort vs reward efficiency | 1-10: 10 = low effort, high reward |
| **S** (Size) | Potential dollar value of airdrop | 1-10: 10 = life-changing money |

### How to Use the Score

**Calculate aggregate:** (H + E + F + S) / 4

**Decision matrix:**

| Aggregate | Action | Time Investment |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 7-10 | Full farming | Daily activity, significant capital |
| 5-6 | Moderate farming | Weekly activity, moderate capital |
| 3-4 | Minimal footprint | 3-10 actions total, move on |
| 1-2 | Skip or waitlist | No active farming |

### Scoring Examples

**High-value opportunity (score 8+):**
- H: 9 (everyone in CT talking about it)
- E: 8 (confirmed points system)
- F: 8 (simple actions, clear rewards)
- S: 7 (large VC backing, no token yet)
- Aggregate: 8.0 → Full farming

**Mid-tier opportunity (score 5-6):**
- H: 6 (known project, moderate buzz)
- E: 6 (likely airdrop, not confirmed)
- F: 5 (some effort required)
- S: 5 (moderate size expected)
- Aggregate: 5.5 → Weekly activity

**Low-priority (score 3-4):**
- H: 4 (limited awareness)
- E: 5 (might happen)
- F: 3 (high effort, unclear reward)
- S: 3 (small or uncertain)
- Aggregate: 3.75 → Minimal footprint only

## Application: Action Templates by Category

Once you've scored a project, use the appropriate action template:

### Chains (L1/L2)
- 30-100 transactions over 6-12 weeks
- Bridge in from multiple sources
- Use 3-7 different dapps
- Deploy a simple contract once
- Keep some native token in wallet

### DeFi Protocols
- Deposit meaningful amount
- Swap multiple times
- LP for 7-30 days
- Borrow and repay at least once
- Repeat core actions weekly

### Perp DEXes
- Deposit collateral
- Execute 20-80 trades
- Spread volume across pairs
- Maintain balance in account
- Hit volume tier if applicable

### Social/Identity
- Complete full profile
- Verify all credentials
- Daily actions (post, engage)
- Referrals if tracked
- Use all core features

### DePIN
- Uptime is everything
- Run node/app continuously
- Complete all available tasks
- Maintain consistent operation

## Signals and Patterns

**Strong airdrop signals:**
- Points system launched
- Testnet with achievements
- "Season 1" terminology
- Large VC raise, no token
- Competitor just did airdrop

**Timing patterns:**
- Testnets 3-6 months before mainnet
- Points campaigns 1-3 months before TGE
- Airdrop usually within 1-2 weeks of announcement
- Season ends often trigger drops

**Distribution patterns:**
- Linear: Rewards proportional to activity
- Tiered: Step functions at thresholds
- Lottery: Random selection among qualifiers
- Hybrid: Mix of the above

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-farming low-tier projects**
   - Fix: Score everything, concentrate on top tier

2. **All actions in one day**
   - Fix: Spread 3-5 actions over 2-6 weeks

3. **Ignoring wallet hygiene**
   - Fix: Segment wallets by risk level

4. **Chasing every new project**
   - Fix: Maintain focus list, evaluate new ones monthly

5. **Not tracking what you've done**
   - Fix: Simple spreadsheet of wallet, project, status

6. **Forgetting to claim**
   - Fix: Set reminders for known drop dates

## Risk Management

### Wallet Strategy
```
Main Wallet: NEVER touches farms
├── Only holds core assets
├── Used for large value transfers
└── Maximum security

Farm Wallet(s): Daily farming
├── Acceptable loss if compromised
├── Can use multiple for different tiers
└── Regular but not maximum security

High-Risk Wallet: Sketchy protocols
├── Assume it will get drained
├── Minimal funds
└── Used for unaudited/new protocols
```

### Capital Allocation
- Never allocate more than you can afford to lose
- Gas costs should not exceed 10% of expected value
- Locked capital opportunity cost matters

## Conclusion

- H/E/F/S scoring systematically ranks opportunities
- Match effort to score: full farming for 7+, minimal for 3-4
- Use category-specific action templates
- Wallet hygiene prevents catastrophic losses
- Most airdrops aren't worth it - focus on the top tier
