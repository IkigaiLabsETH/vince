## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate DeFi protocol evaluation through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to DeFi protocol evaluation
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated

## How to Use AI to Analyze Your Top Content

This piece argues creators should stop guessing and use AI to reverse-engineer their best posts: feed your top-performing content into a large model, surface repeatable patterns, and codify those findings into a personal playbook so you never start from zero. The author frames your content library as evidence to study rather than a set of guesses and notes that AI can do in minutes what would otherwise take hours of manual review. *Pull the lever. Hope for a winner. Repeat.*

The recommended three-step method is concrete and platform-agnostic: 1) pull your top 20 posts by engagement (full text copied into one document); 2) run a “top performer” analysis in an AI model (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude) using specific, structured prompts that request defined output formats and role assignments; 3) have AI convert the patterns into a one-page content playbook listing winning hooks, topics, and formats. The author emphasizes that surface metrics (views, likes) aren’t enough — you should ask the model to detect emotional triggers, hook sentence structures, recurring topics, and whether audiences prefer personal stories or data-driven arguments.

Examples from the author’s own test show the practical payoff: AI revealed that his top posts opened with a specific credential tied to the topic and named a broken system or false belief readers were stuck in, while weaker posts “eased into the point,” tried to cover too many ideas, or started with context instead of conviction. A cited 2024 HubSpot study supports the approach: marketers using data-driven content strategies were 72% more likely to report positive ROI than those relying on intuition. The author warns the analysis quality hinges on prompt quality — vague prompts yield vague results — and says he built three precise prompts for this workflow (Top Performer Pattern Analysis, Hook Reverse-Engineering, Personal Content Playbook Generator). Paid subscribers are offered those exact prompts. *Your content library IS your game tape.*
