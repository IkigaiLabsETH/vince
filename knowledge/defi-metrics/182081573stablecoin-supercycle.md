**Strategic Framework:**
- **Long-Term Viability Assessment:** Apply a dual lens of regulatory and market analysis to evaluate which stablecoins are likely to sustain growth and attract institutional investment.
- **Diversified Portfolio Construction:** Consider incorporating a mix of stablecoins and DeFi products to balance risk and capture yield across various market conditions.
- **Continuous Learning Loop:** Establish a feedback mechanism for investment decisions based on market developments and personal experiences to refine strategies over time.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

I’m pulling up old charts—DefiLlama snapshots from December 19, 2025—total stablecoin cap sitting right around $310 billion, give or take a few depending on who’s counting. Up 50-60% on the year from the low $200s back in January. 

And honestly... it feels kind of wild.

## Context

But not in the moonboy way. More like watching something you spotted early finally crawl out of the gutter, battered but breathing.

Look, I’ve been around long enough to remember when stablecoins were this sketchy side experiment. Tether in 2017-18, those endless debates about reserves—attestations that felt like reading tea leaves. I dipped toes then, mostly USDC once Circle started getting serious about transparency. Sold too much too soon, classic me. Thought the depeg risks weren’t worth it when Treasuries were paying nothing anyway.

And now? Here we are. 
**
The GENIUS Act signed back in July ‘25—Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, what a mouthful—finally gave the thing a federal spine. No more patchwork state rules; issuers have to back 1:1 with real liquid stuff, monthly disclosures, the works. Institutions could finally stop pretending they weren’t interested.

## Main

Honestly, that was the unlock. Not some hype cycle. Just boring clarity.

Remember the early days? I’d sit there reloading Tether’s reserve page, wondering if tomorrow was the day it all cracked. Fast forward, USDT’s pushing $186 billion cap, still the liquidity king—dominant in Asia, LatAm, anywhere fiat’s a headache. USDC trailing at $77-78 billion, but the one institutions actually trust, with those Deloitte attestations and BlackRock ties.

And the yield stuff... that’s where it gets interesting.**

But first, a regret. I missed the full ride on a couple plays. Back in ‘23-’24, I had some DAI in Maker’s old savings rate—nice little 5-8% when rates were climbing. Felt safe, overcollateralized. Then Sky rebrand hits in ‘25, USDS/sUSDS takes over, TVL balloons to $4-5 billion in savings alone, SSR tracking Treasuries at 4-4.5%. I rotated out too early, chasing some alt that melted. 

Sold too soon—again.

Same story with Ondo. Tokenized Treasuries looked boring when USDY was tiny. Now? TVL north of $690 million, yields steady 4-5%, multi-chain, institutions piling in. Private credit side exploding too—total non-stable RWAs around $30-35 billion, private credit leading at $15-16B, Treasuries $7-9B. Capital climbing the risk curve, just like it always does.
**
Ethena was the wild one. sUSDe hitting double digits early ‘25 on funding rates, TVL spiking to $14 billion or so mid-year. I threw a chunk in during a dip, rode some nice yields—averaged maybe 8-10% for a stretch. Then rates normalized, TVL halved to $7-8 billion by December, APY down to 4-5%. Still held peg, BlackRock integrations helped credibility. But the unwind stung. Levered loops blowing up everywhere. Felt like ‘22 all over again.

And PayPal’s PYUSD... bet you didn’t see that coming mainstream. Started small, now $3.9 billion supply, baked into Venmo, YouTube payouts even. Consumer side finally waking up.

Coinbase got clever too—USDC lending via Morpho vaults right in the app. Yields spiked to 10.8% back in September when demand was hot, settled to 5-7% by year-end. Accessible DeFi without leaving the platform. Smart. I parked some there for the ease, though the smart contract risks keep me up sometimes. Bad debt, liquidity crunches—no FDIC.

Risks? Yeah, let’s talk straight.**

USDT still offshore, transparency better but history lingers. One bad attestation and... poof. USDC cleaner, regulated, but tied to banking system—remember ‘23 SVB scare? Depegged hard then.

**Diversify issuers. Always.**

Portfolio-wise, I’ve settled into something boring: 60% core yield like sUSDS and USDY for the steady compounding. 25% platforms—COIN stock mostly, some PYPL for the consumer bet, CRCL if it dips. 15% alpha—whatever variable stuff looks sane, Ethena when rates perk, Morpho vaults.

Scale up stables when everything else bleeds. Dry powder.

Analysts talking supercycle now—Polygon folks saying 100,000 issuers by 2030, banks jumping in with branded ones. JPM more conservative, $500-600B by ‘28. Me? I lean toward the bigger side, but cautiously. Real utility’s here: remittances, settlements, treasury parking with yield.

But banks won’t roll over. They’ll fight with tokenized deposits, CBDC pilots.

Reminds me of WebTV days—pioneered streaming boxes, Apple featured us, Quiksilver cash flowing. Thought we were early forever. Then YouTube hit, everything changed overnight. Same feeling here. 

Stablecoins aren’t going away. They’re the rails.

Entering ‘26, yield-bearing dollars, fragmented issuers, TradFi bridges deepening. Not hype. Just infrastructure maturing.

We’ll see. Markets always humble you. Keep reading the attestations, watch the reserves, stack quietly. And if I’m wrong again? Well... nothing new I guess!

And one last thing before I shut this screen down...This Canton announcement landed just a few days ago—December 16 press release, fresh as the coffee I’m about to brew. World Liberty Financial, that Trump-family tied outfit, saying they’re intending to drop their USD1 stablecoin onto the Canton Network. 

USD1’s already north of $2 billion cap (some trackers say $2.7B), fastest grower out there, backed by Treasuries and cash equivalents, handled through BitGo. Canton isn’t some retail wild west chain. It’s privacy-by-design, built for the big boys—regulated finance, selective disclosure so your trades don’t flash to competitors. They’re talking intraday repos, bond settlements, collateral for derivatives. Compliant rails with actual decentralization flavor.

If it happens—and it’s “intention” for now, not locked—this could pull USD1 into real institutional flows. Sovereigns, asset managers wanting a clean digital dollar without public ledger exposure. Canton already hosts trillions in tokenized stuff, DTCC pilots, Circle convergences.

But here’s the pause that keeps me up...Political baggage obvious. Growth tied to big chunks—Abu Dhabi deals, Binance settlements in USD1. Transparency promises quarterly audits, Chainlink PoR, but history’s short. Risks? Same as any issuer: custody freezes, regulatory whims, counterparty if BitGo stumbles. Plus the optics—conflicts swirling.

Me? Watching volumes post-deployment. If enterprise bites, Canton becomes the quiet backbone for when TradFi finally crosses over. If not... another headline fade. Kind of wild how these pieces fit late in the cycle. Stablecoins going from sketchy to settlement layer. We’ll see. Execution over announcements, always.

Coffee’s calling. Charts tomorrow.
