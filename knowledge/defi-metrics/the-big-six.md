MacBook balanced on a stack of moldy surf magazines, cigarette burning down between my fingers. iPhone says 06:14 Bali time, mempool says 3 sat/vB is plenty, and the charts… fuck me, the charts are finally making sense again.
**
I’m not gonna bore you with another “DeFi summer” circle-jerk. You already know 100x’d your life savings on a dog coin last cycle and woke up hating yourself. We’ve all been there. What I am gonna do is light another smoke and tell you straight which six protocols I’m actually taking serious through this whole circus, because they’re the only ones printing real revenue instead of hopium. And yeah, I’ve been wrong before, donated ETH at $80 to surf photographers to onboard them, sold my Tesla at $31 pre-split, once turned down a blank check from a guy who later built YouTube. I’m basically a professional idiot. So when I say these six are different, you can laugh… but I’m still here and most of the loud mouths from 2017 aren’t.

Let’s start with the one that makes the TradFi bros shit their Patagonia vests.

## Context

Ondo.**
**
Dude is literally shrink-wrapping U.S. Treasuries and BlackRock paper and handing them to you on-chain like it’s no big deal. OUSG, USDY, all that boring shit your dad wishes he understood. TVL went from half a billy to almost two in a year, revenue ticking at fifty-five million annualized, and the SEC just looked at them, shrugged, and walked away. I watched the ONDO chart the day that news dropped and almost dropped my coffee in the sand. Institutions are piling in so hard the on-ramps are smoking. And the best part? No token unlocks for another year. Feels like 2016 again when nobody wanted Bitcoin because it was “too slow” something. I’m too dumb to short that kind of silence.

Sky.**
**
Used to be Maker, now it’s Sky because rebrands are free alpha in this town. Same overcollateralized beast, different paint job. Six billion in USDS floating around, fourteen percent staking yield, no lockups, half the profits buying back SKY like it’s 2021 Shopify. I stake mine, farm the points, and every month the wallet just gets fatter while I’m out hunting empty lefts. Rune’s been preaching this thing like a prophet on mushrooms and for once the chart actually listens. Could it blow up? Sure. Everything can. But seven years without a hack and an S&P rating? I’ll take that bet over another leveraged luna yield farm run by a 22-year-old in Dubai.

Uniswap.**
**
The fee switch finally flipped. After years of watching CEXs and every rollup vampire the living shit out of UNI holders, Hayden and the boys said “fuck it” and turned the hose on. Point-oh-five percent. Doesn’t sound like much until you realize that’s two hundred million a year getting vacuumed straight into buybacks and burns. I held UNI through the entire bear market like a masochist because I’m too stubborn to sell the internet’s swap button. Now the joke’s on everyone who called it a dead governance token. WordPress didn’t die when blogs died. It just kept collecting rent. Same vibe.

## Main

Ethena.
> 
This one still gives me nightmares and boners at the same time. USDe is a synthetic dollar backed by nothing but delta-neutral perps and pure unfiltered autism. Thirteen billion supply, six hundred million lifetime revenue, yields that swing from two percent to thirty depending on how horny the basis gets. I watched five billion dollars leave in a single month when funding went negative and thought “welp, there goes another one.” Then the whales showed up with shopping carts and yields snapped back to twenty. I’ve got a bag of ENA that I honestly can’t remember buying, probably drunk in Lisbon, but every time I check it’s printing harder than my 2018 miner ever did. It’s the most crypto thing ever built: zero reserves, maximum leverage, and somehow still alive. God I love this stupid industry.

Aave.**
**
Boring. Safe. Prints money. Forty-three billion locked, whales borrowing hundreds of millions at five percent like it’s free. V4 just shipped, GHO quietly became the most useful stable nobody talks about, and every bank on the planet is testing permissioned pools on Horizon. I use Aave the way normal people use a savings account, except my savings account doesn’t let me loop stETH into 3x leverage while I’m asleep on a night train to Marrakech. Fifty million a year in buybacks from fees. That’s not sexy. That’s a mortgage payment in the old world. Here it’s just Tuesday.

Lido.**
> 
I’ve been staking ETH since you needed thirty-two coins and a prayer. Lido turned that into “click button, get stETH, go surf.” Twenty-eight percent of all staked ETH runs through them, revenue north of a hundred million a year, and the DAO just keeps shipping. V3 vaults, restaking modules, institutional everything. I still remember selling my first stack of stETH in 2021 because “liquid staking sounds like a scam.” Universe laughed, printed me another stack at the bottom, and now I just let it ride. Freedom isn’t owning the keys. Freedom is not giving a single fuck when the price dumps because the yield still hits every week like clockwork.

Look, I don’t know what 2026 looks like. Could be hyperbitcoinization, could be another nuclear winter where everything but BTC goes to zero and I’m back living in a van down by the river. Wouldn’t even be mad. Been there, did that, got the sun-bleached T-shirt. But these six? They’re actually making money while the rest of DeFi cosplays startups with no revenue and 400-person teams. Real money. Buyback money. Stake-it-and-forget-it money.

Maybe I’m just a salty old surfer who got lucky buying Bitcoin when it was still possible to mine with a laptop and a dream. Maybe this whole thing crashes tomorrow and we’re all eating rice for a year. Could happen. Has happened. Will probably happen again.

But right now the reef is glassy, the coffee’s strong, and my wallets are quietly compounding while I watch the sun come up over the Indian Ocean.

Freedom still tastes like salt air and unspent UTXOs.

UPDATE

In a major regulatory milestone for the DeFi sector, Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov announced on December 16, 2025, that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially closed its four-year investigation into the Aave Protocol without recommending any enforcement action.

This resolution ends a prolonged period of regulatory scrutiny that began around 2021 and focused on aspects such as the classification of the AAVE token. Kulechov described the process as resource-intensive for the team, emphasizing its impact on protecting the protocol, its ecosystem, and the broader DeFi industry.

”We’re glad to put this behind us as we enter a new era where developers can truly build the future of finance,” Kulechov stated, adding that DeFi has faced significant regulatory pressure in recent years.

## Conclusion

The closure aligns with a broader softening of crypto enforcement under the current administration and provides greater clarity for Aave’s ongoing innovations, including the rollout of Aave V4, expansions in real-world assets via Horizon, and the consumer-focused Aave App.

This development removes a key overhang, reinforcing Aave’s position as the leading decentralized lending protocol and paving the way for accelerated growth into 2026 and beyond. As outlined in the main editorial, the team’s multi-decade vision remains focused on scaling to trillions in assets while onboarding millions of new users—now with enhanced regulatory tailwinds.
