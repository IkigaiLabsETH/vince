I’m half-slumped on the couch scrolling X like an idiot. You know the vibe – can’t sleep, brain won’t shut off. Then this thread pops up. Anonymous dude unloading his confession: pulled over 10 million last cycle through straight-up grift. Rugs, ponzis, presales, ecosystem dumps. The works.

But the real kick in the teeth? It yanks me back to my absolute worst bagholder moment – aping into Olympus DAO. That whole (3,3) rebase fairy tale, staking for “backing” while it hyperinflated to nothing. Millions gone. I still wince. Peak dumb money, buying the dream hard. Self-deprecating as hell now, but yeah...

## Context

I was textbook retail chum.

Honestly, don’t condone a second of what this guy did. He fleeced people left and right – probably indirectly got some of my money too. But reading it? Darkly mesmerizing. Like finally seeing the scam artist’s playbook laid bare.

Dude jumps in mid-2020, no clue about crypto, just figures everyone’s stuck home with stimulus checks burning holes – easier to gamble online than buy stocks. Gets wrecked over and over on Uniswap junk and those silly food token farms. Blown away how simple it is to rug others. Hates bleeding fiat. Snaps: Enough. Turns hunter.

## Main

The recipe? Embarrassingly basic. Whip up a ponzi or DeFi toy, fork it onto the hot new EVM chain. First-mover frenzy. Hot money bouncing: Drop an Aave on Fantom or Harmony – you’re early! Uniswap clone on Velas, BSC, Dogechain, Avax ghosts, Elastos, Oasis, Fuse, Telos, Astar. Early!

Team? Bare bones. One dev does everything: domain, hosting, tweak public contracts with ponzi knobs – rug buttons, deadman switches, inside exploits. Marketer runs socials, pens those long “why we’re revolutionary” bait pieces for gullible retail, shills off-Twitter to hook normies new to crypto, handles BD for grants. CM sets up Discords/TGs, bots to ban FUD and spammers, spins explanations, occasional graphics.

Artist? Churns 10k trash apes recolored for your chain, sources cheap pixel or 3D work, negotiates quick delivery, whips videos and charts. Couple months max. Boom – you’re “building.”

Process? Dumb flowchart. Spot rising TVL on DefiLlama. Chain hot? Fill the gap: No Aave? Uniswap fork. Got basics? NFT market. More? RWA utility collection. OHM missing? Clone it (ha). Got that? Convex-style. Saturated? Memecoin with utility teases. Full house? Web3 game, mint crates and packs. Endless plays.

Fuel was everywhere: Newbies discovering crypto, flush from ETH moons ($90 to $4k rides), UNI airdrops printing free thousands (multiple clean wallets, wealth effect max), COVID stimulus.

Everyone loaded, everyone naive. Dev-side heaven.

Tactic: Pitch grants pre-launch. Quick response? Play semi-legit. Slow or ghost? Hard rug, presale bleed. Often mixed. Traction hits? Snag native token grants, dump straight to USDC monthly. Everything hyped, temporary – no holding overvalued chain trash.

Lifespan? 2-3 months tops. Dev bounces after one, marketer/CM keeps facade: Figma/Upwork mockups teased eternally, never shipped. Suck in desperate DCAs – “look, alive!”

No vesting mostly. ‘22 rolls in, retail smarter – sniffing unlocked LP, mint abuse. Adapt: Inside-only exploits, ghost presales, timelock proposals nobody reads by month 3 (sneak max team take), delay big KOL payments till token’s nuked ($20k shill becomes $300).

Competition explodes – dozens copying by late ‘21. Rivals? Alt-account FUD storms on Twitter/Reddit/forums. Send fake passionate CM to “intern,” grab mod access, nuke everything. Bribe those auditors for the checkmark. Flirt with blackmail via coerced info – but backed off, too sketchy. Pure PVP carnage.Exits clean: Mixers, bribed bridges to skip freezes, bought KYC on shady exchanges for laundering.

The twist: He insists it’s gone forever. AI makes anyone fork code, gen assets for pocket change. Grants vanished – chains flipped to VC slow-rugs. Retail scorched, Terra the final dagger (he says worse than FTX). No fresh marks. Marketers barely worth it now. His circle? Addictions wrecked lives, most quit for calmer hustles. Survivors? Spot BTC/ETH/XMR bags, light yields, deeply skeptical that wild 2019-22 chaos returns.

## Conclusion

Kind of wild, right? Zero-sum to the bone.I’m not totally sold it’s impossible forever. Greed doesn’t die. Could be wrong – some new AI chain or whatever pulls in the next wave of fools.Another cringe L: That ‘21 Harmony yield farm hype – grants incoming, partners teased. Aped big. Woke to inside-job drain overnight.

It’s exhausting. This space chews optimism, spits cynics.But here we are. You too?Next time some shiny new fork screams FOMO? Just... sit on your hands a day. Peek the wallets on-chain. Or skip aping entirely for a week. Try it – see if the itch fades. Hit me back if it works, or if I’m full of shit and the next one’s printing. Either way, pour one out for us eternal bagholders. Stay sharp out there.
