As we head into the back half of 2025, our investment thesis is crystalizing around a simple, high-conviction bet: the resurgence of onchain capital markets. Forget the noise of memecoins and over-hyped narratives—our strategy for Q4 2025 and all of 2026 is laser-focused on being hyper-active as business angels on Echo, the onchain investment platform founded by crypto veteran Cobie and recently acquired by Coinbase. This isn’t just another tool in the toolbox; it’s the infrastructure we’re using to source, underwrite, and deploy into the next wave of asymmetric opportunities.

In this piece, we’ll break down the WHAT, HOW, and WHY of Echo, and explain why we’re doubling down on early-stage, illiquid bets over chasing liquid coins that have already printed 10x, 100x, or even 1000x returns. If you’re tired of FOMO-ing into pumps that leave you holding the bag, this is for you. Let’s dive in.

## Context

**What Is Echo? The Onchain AngelList for Crypto’s Next Generation**

Echo is an onchain platform designed to democratize early-stage investing, making it easier for communities to pool capital and for founders to raise funds without the gatekeeping of traditional VC funnels. Launched in beta by Cobie (Jordan Fish) in April 2024, Echo quickly became the go-to for crypto-native deal flow, facilitating over $200 million in raises across roughly 300 deals in its first 18 months.

By mid-2025, it had onboarded 10,000+ qualified investors and clocked a median ROI of 8x on closed deals—numbers that scream efficiency in a space notorious for opacity.

## Main

At its core, Echo operates like a blockchain-powered AngelList: verified investors (angels like us) join private funding rounds under the same terms as institutional VCs, with everything settled transparently onchain in USDC. No more Excel spreadsheets or shady side deals—deals are structured as simple prevailing value (SPV) vehicles for clean cap tables. Founders get community-aligned tools to raise directly from their tribes, while investors tap into opportunities that were previously locked behind closed doors.

Key features that set Echo apart:

- 
Private Sales: Curated deals led by trusted “group leads” (experienced angels who share investments they’re making themselves). Think: following a deal from someone like Cobie, who’s symmetrical in risk and reward.

- 
Sonar: Echo’s flagship public sale product, allowing founders to self-host token launches on chains like Base, Solana, or Hyperliquid. It’s plug-and-play for compliant, community-driven ICOs.

- 
Onchain Everything: Fees are success-based (5% on profits only), with full transparency via blockchain. No upfront costs, no hidden wires.

Echo’s traction speaks volumes: MegaETH raised $10 million in three minutes on the platform, and projects like Ethena (a synthetic dollar protocol) used it for their seed rounds.

It’s not hype—it’s proven infrastructure for onchain capital formation.

How Does Echo Work? A Step-by-Step for Aspiring Angels

Getting active on Echo is straightforward, but it demands the mindset of a true angel: patience, due diligence, and a tolerance for 80% failure rates (more on that later). Here’s how we—and soon, you—roll:

- 
Onboard and Verify: Sign up at app.echo.xyz, complete KYC (it’s US-compliant from day one), and get accredited if needed. This weeds out tourists; only serious players (10,000+ strong) make the cut.

- 
Follow the Leaders: Curate your feed by following group leads—angels with skin in the game. We follow a tight list: Cobie for blue-chip crypto bets, plus a handful of DeFi OGs and AI-crypto hybrids. Each lead posts deals they’re investing in, complete with term sheets, founder decks, and vesting schedules.

- 
Source and Underwrite: Deals drop fast—hundreds per year. We spend a few hours per opportunity: grilling founders on Discord, stress-testing tokenomics, and modeling downside scenarios. Pro tip: Always ask, “Would I hold this for 12 months if vesting changes?” Crypto founders love tweaking terms for CEX listings.

- 
Invest and Track: Commit USDC onchain. Echo handles the SPV setup, and you get pro-rata shares. Post-close, use the built-in leaderboard to track unrealized ROI across your portfolio. We’ve seen groups kick underperformers off the platform based on data—brutal but fair.

- 
Exit and Iterate: Tokens unlock over time (typically 12-24 months). Sonar integrations mean seamless paths to liquidity on DEXs or even Coinbase listings. We aim for 10+ deals per quarter, rebalancing based on macro.

It’s not passive—it’s active angel work. But with Echo’s tools, what used to take weeks now takes hours. Why Echo? And Why Early-Stage Angels Over Liquid Moonshots? The “why” boils down to three interlocking convictions: superior dealflow, asymmetric risk/reward, and the maturation of crypto infrastructure.

Echo isn’t just a platform; it’s our edge in a crowded market.

First, dealflow velocity. Pre-Echo, angels like us relied on DMs, Twitter whispers, and VC intros—slow and biased toward incumbents. Echo’s community-driven model surfaces 300+ deals annually, from seed-stage DeFi protocols to AI-onchain hybrids. Post-Coinbase acquisition (October 2025 for ~$375M), expect even better: Sonar integrates directly into Coinbase by mid-2026, unlocking retail access and tokenized RWAs. Cobie’s team (now ~40 strong) joins Coinbase’s Institutional arm, blending Echo’s crypto-native vibe with exchange-grade compliance. We’re already seeing upgrades: easier onboarding, broader chain support, and ties to Coinbase’s secondary markets.

Second, asymmetric upside in the unknown. Liquid tokens are seductive. Who wouldn’t want in on the next PEPE? But by the time they’re liquid and pumping, 90% of the multiple is baked in. You’re buying at peak euphoria, with rugs, dumps, and regulatory whiplash lurking. We’ve all been there: the 100x bag that turns into a 10x haircut overnight.

Early-stage Echo bets flip the script. You’re in at $1-10M valuations, with median 8x ROIs and outliers like Ethena delivering 50x+.

Sure, 8/10 flop—that’s venture math. But the winners? They compound your portfolio for years, not weeks. No chasing pumps; just patient capital in founders building real moats. Plus, onchain settlement means no disputes—your tokens vest predictably, even if founders pivot.

Third, the macro tailwinds. Crypto’s post-election glow (shoutout to the stablecoin supercycle) is fueling a builder renaissance.

With Coinbase’s muscle, Echo scales beyond crypto: tokenized securities, RWAs, even TradFi crossovers.

## Conclusion

We’re positioning for that: Q4 2025 targets include 10-15 DeFi seeds and 5 AI plays; 2026 ramps to 50+ deals, with 20% allocated to Sonar public sales.

In short, Echo lets us be the “noble failures” turned winners that Cobie dreamed of—symmetrical risk, community trust, and outsized impact. Crypto’s future isn’t in liquid lotteries; it’s in building the rails for the next 10 years.
