USDH launched on September 23, 2025, following a competitive governance vote among issuers. Issued by [Native Markets](https://nativemarkets.com/)—a startup co-founded by Hyperliquid investor Max Fiege, former Uniswap Labs president Mary-Catherine Lader, and blockchain researcher Anish Agnihotri—USDH is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and backed by cash and short-term US Treasury securities. Reserves are managed via Stripe’s Bridge platform for tokenization and compliance. It was deployed natively on Hyperliquid’s HyperEVM (an Ethereum-compatible layer) under Hyperliquid Improvement Proposal (HIP-1) and as an ERC-20 token, enabling seamless integration across the ecosystem.

The Only Stable Yield That Still Feels Like 2021

## Context

While the rest of DeFi is busy apologizing for 4–6% APYs and praying T-bills don’t raise another 25 bps, Hyperliquid quietly built a fiat-backed stablecoin that pays the entire Treasury yield back to its own ecosystem — and it’s working.

From Leakage to Capture: The $220 M Heist Reversed

Hyperliquid, the perpetuals monopoly (80 % of all DeFi perp volume, $296 B traded last 30 days, $100 M+ monthly revenue), used to send roughly $220 million a year in Treasury interest straight to Circle and Coinbase because 95 % of its $5.6 B in stable deposits were USDC.On September 23, 2025, that stopped.USDH — issued by Native Markets (Max Fiege, Mary-Catherine Lader, Anish Agnihotri) and selected in the most brutal governance vote of the year — is backed 1:1 by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries tokenized via Stripe Bridge + Superstate.**Every basis point those Treasuries earn (~4.85 % today) now splits 50/50:

## Main

- 
50 % → direct HYPE buybacks (Hyperliquid Assistance Fund)

- 
50 % → grants, liquidity incentives, and future airdrops

Why This Feels Different in a Dead Yield Market

Most stablecoin “yield” in 2025 is either:

- 
synthetic and dying (USDe down 50 % TVL in October)

- 
fake and subsidized (liquidity-mining ponzis)

- 
off-chain and taxed (CeFi 6–9 % with KYC and withdrawal limits)

USDH is none of those. It is literally just the U.S. government paying you, routed through a chain that burns 97 % of its fees and is about to buy back its own token with your interest.

That is the closest thing left to the 2021 “risk-free” cheat code — except this time the risk is actually close to zero.

Current Best Plays (8–15 % Risk-Adjusted, Ranked by Effort)

- 
Zero-Effort Points Farming (Recommended for 90 % of readers)
Park USDH in Mercury, Nest, or Felix Vanilla single-sided deposits.
Confirmed budgets: $15–20 M in HYPE-denominated airdrops.
Snapshots expected before end of Q1 2026.
Effective yield: 4.85 % base + HYPE appreciation + airdrop convexity → 10–18 % realistic.

- 
Felix Borrow-Lend Loop (Medium Effort, Highest Conviction)
Deposit USDH → borrow USDH against it → re-deposit → repeat 3–4×.
Current blended: ~12–14 % + heavy points multiplier.
Risk: smart-contract only (Felix is battle-tested, no admin keys).

- 
Native Hyperliquid Vaults (Set-and-Forget)
Auto-compounding vault live on dashboard.
8–10 % all-in, zero management, still qualifies for points.

- 
Perp Collateral + Funding Arb (Degen Tier)
Use USDH as margin on COIN-USDH perps → collect positive funding (1–5 % ann.) while HIP-3 keeps taker fees negligible.

All four strategies are currently outperforming every major stablecoin farm on Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and Base once you include the HYPE flywheel and airdrop optionality.

Risks (Because Nothing Is Truly Free in 2025)

- 
November 29 cliff unlock: 9.92 M HYPE (~$308 M, 2.66 % of supply) — buybacks expected to absorb, but short-term volatility likely.

- 
Regulatory: fiat-backed, Stripe/BlackRock custodied → extremely compliant, but still a custodian risk.

- 
Competition: Aster closing volume gap, but Hyperliquid’s moat is execution speed + this yield loop.

Verdict**

In a market where “yield farming” now means praying for 6 % on Aave while paying gas, USDH is the last remaining place where parking stablecoins still feels like printing money — because you literally are printing money that money for Hyperliquid, and they are giving half of it back to you.

If you are not allocating at least a small position before the November 29 unlock dust settles, you are voluntarily leaking yield in 2025. We will keep this post continuously updated as new vaults, points programs, and HIPs drop.

Next catalysts in the next 90 days alone: 

## Conclusion

HIP-5 fee buyback, 
HyperEVM mainnet, 
confirmed Airdrop Season 2.

Farm accordingly.
