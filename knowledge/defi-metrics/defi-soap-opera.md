You know that feeling—doomscrolling through governance forums because sleep’s not happening. And there it is: Aave blowing up over some swap integration. Again. We’ve seen this movie before, haven’t we?

Look, Aave’s been the king of lending in this clown show we call DeFi forever. Billions locked, survived every hack and crash without imploding. Institutions love it, retail apes pile in. But now? As we’re wrapping up 2025, the cracks are showing big time between the DAO—the supposed “community owners”—and Aave Labs, Stani’s crew that’s actually building the damn thing.

## Context

The spark this time? Early December, Labs quietly swaps out ParaSwap for CoWSwap on aave.com. Sounds boring—better prices, MEV protection, whatever.

But here’s the kicker: old setup funneled surplus fees straight to the DAO treasury. Nice little revenue stream for token holders. New one? Slaps on 15-25 bps fees that, per some sharp delegate digging chains (shoutout EzR3aL), go right to Labs-controlled wallets. We’re talking potentially $10 million a year diverted.

**Stealth move.**

## Main

Marc Zeller from ACI calls it “stealth privatization.” 

He’s pissed—the brand’s value comes from the DAO’s conservative risk calls, surviving crises, token holders eating the bad debt risks. 

Not just some logo Labs owns legally because DAOs can’t hold IP. 

Economically? We all paid for it in blood, sweat, and bad trades.

Labs fires back: Protocol’s the DAO’s (on-chain stuff). Interface? That’s our product. We fund it, secure it, maintain it. Past surpluses were donations, not rules. Stani’s out there saying it’s fine to monetize products that don’t touch core economics. Fair point, I guess. Running frontends ain’t free.

But it’s not just this. Pile on Horizon—their RWA push that cost the DAO incentives while barely breaking even, questions about where the real money went. That MegaETH deployment where Labs snags points on the side. And those Vaults—simple wrappers Labs built, but if they become the default in V4, suddenly Labs captures fees on top of DAO liquidity.
> 
It’s exhausting. Reminds me of Uniswap’s old Labs vs Foundation beef over frontend fees. They fixed it—aligned everything to UNI holders. Aave could too. But legal quirks make it messier.

Back in, what, 2018? I was freelancing for some crypto rag, hyped this “decentralized” lending startup that promised no middlemen. Wrote a glowing piece, got paid in tokens that rug-pulled weeks later. Felt like an idiot. Self-deprecating laugh here—taught me everything “decentralized” usually means “centralized team with extra steps and governance theater.” 

And now Morpho. God, Morpho. 

They’re the quiet kid in class who’s actually smart. 

Pure infrastructure—no risk params, no built-in products. Outsource vaults to curators who charge fees and own the screw-ups. Association just builds tools, SDKs, data. Doesn’t even launch their own vault for easy cash. Cleaner politics. Flaws, sure—less user-friendly, vault quality varies. But if you’re tired of the drama table, it’s the least dirty one.

I’m not saying ditch Aave. It’s still massive, safe as DeFi gets. But these fights erode trust. Token holders bore the risks; shouldn’t they capture more upside?

Could be wrong—maybe Labs needs the cash to keep innovating. Gray areas everywhere. Kind of wild how fast it escalated, right?

Anyway. Next time you’re poking around DeFi dashboards, skip aave.com for a day. Hop into Morpho or some third-party frontend. See if the grass feels greener—or if it’s just different bullshit. Drop me a note if you try it. 

## Conclusion

Or tell me I’m full of it. 

Either way, we’ll laugh about it over virtual wine.
