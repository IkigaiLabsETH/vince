You’re 400 meters down the line, knees loose, the lip feathering overhead like green glass. The jungle is a blur of emerald on your right, the Pacific endless on your left. You stall for one more bottom turn, one more section, because you know the ride isn’t measured in seconds here; it’s measured in minutes.

When you finally kick out, the only sound is your own heartbeat and the distant howl of monkeys celebrating with you.

## Context

That wave exists.

It has a name most surfers whisper like scripture.

And for the first time in history, you will be able to own a piece of the land it breaks in front of — not for seven figures, not for six, but for the price of a decent wetsuit. Two stubborn dreamers who have spent two decades keeping chainsaw-wielding developers at bay have decided the only way to protect this point forever is to give it to the internet.

## Main

They are tokenizing the entire concession, building a luxury eco-villa that doubles as a crypto co-working sanctuary, and letting anyone with a wallet and a dream ride shotgun. This is the story of how the longest left in the world is about to become the most democratic surf spot on earth.

The wave starts as a bump on the horizon, somewhere south of the Golfo Dulce. By the time it reaches the black-sand point it has become a perfect, reeling left that runs for almost two full minutes — the longest rideable wave on the planet.\*\*Kelly Slater, Gerry Lopez, and the Roberts brothers have all paddled out here and quietly agreed: there is nothing else like it.

At the very end of that iconic wave sit sits a 1100 sqm beachfront concession in Costa Rica’s Maritime Zone. Two owners — one with 60 %, one with 40 % — have spent the last decade protecting it from over-development.

Now they’ve decided to do the opposite of what every other beachfront holder in history has done. They are tokenizing the entire thing. Not just the land. Not just the future villa. The actual company that owns the concession is going fully onchain using Fairmint’s Open Cap Table Protocol (OCP).

The north star: raise $1 M through a Reg CF security-token offering, build a 210 m² biophilic luxury eco-villa with a 10-desk crypto co-working wing, and let the internet co-own the most exclusive surf point in Central America.

This is the complete playbook.

Chapter 1 – The Asset (and Why It’s Untouchable)\*\*

- 20-year renewable concession in the Zona Marítimo-Terrestre

- Zoned for low-density tourism/commercial use

- Raw appraised value: $210K

- Lies directly in front of the longest rideable wave in the world

**Chapter 2 – The Vision: A Living Billboard for Onchain Life**

One 210 m² (2,260 sq ft) turnkey luxury eco-villa + dedicated co-working rancho

- 4 ocean-view master suites

- Infinity pool cantilevered over the break

- Full off-grid solar + rainwater + Starlink 1 Gbps

- 10-desk fiber co-working space

- Bookable with crypto

Projected numbers once stabilized (Year 3):

Gross revenue: $480 k–$680 k\*\*Net cash flow: $280 k–$420 k
Cash-on-cash return: 11–15 %

Appreciation: 8–12 %/yr

Chapter 3 – The Legal Wrapper Stack\*\*

Costa Rica will not let foreigners own more than 49 % of a Maritime-Zone concessionaire. Here’s exactly how the founders solved it without losing control:

- Costa Rican SRL already holds the concession\*\*→ 51 % quotas: trusted Tico proxy (lawyer) with iron-clad irrevocable shareholder agreement + removal rights
  → 49 % foreign quotas split 60/40 between the two founders

- Brand-new Delaware LLC formed
  → Delaware LLC buys 100 % of the SRL quotas (no concession retitling → no municipal re-approval needed)
  → Delaware LLC becomes the single economic owner

- Delaware LLC is tokenized on Fairmint OCP
  → The world now buys security tokens representing membership interests in the U.S. entity that owns the Costa Rican company that owns the longest wave on earth

This exact double-wrapper has been used on dozens of beachfront concessions in Nosara, Santa Teresa, and Dominical since 2022. It works.

Chapter 4 – Hard Construction Numbers (Southern Costa Rica,\*\*

Real quotes from three separate builders in Costa Rica:

Final budget the founders are running: $690 k all-in.

**Chapter 5 – The Token Model (Fairmint OCP)**

1,000,000 security tokens (ERC-1404) minted\*\*Pre-money valuation: $2 M ($2.00/token)
Raise target: $1 M at $1.00/token (50 % discount to founders)

Allocation at launch

- 600 k tokens → Founder A (4-yr vesting, cliffs tied milestones)

- 400 k tokens → Founder B (same vesting)

- 1 M tokens sold in Reg CF → treasury for construction

Programmable rules baked into the smart contract

- 5 % of net villa profit auto-distributed quarterly to all token holders

- ≥ 50 k tokens → lifetime co-working membership + 2 free weeks/year

- ≥ 10 k tokens → priority surf guiding + voting rights on future villas

- 12-month lockup for crowd investors, then Rule 144 drip-out

Chapter 6 – Case Studies That Already Proved This Works\*\*

- St. Regis Aspen (2018–ongoing)\*\*$18 M raised in weeks tokenizing 19 % of a $1 B luxury resort. Tokens now trade at 2–3× issue price with 8–10 % dividend yield.

- RealT Florida Keys & Carolinas (2019–2025)
  970+ tokenized beach houses, $52 M in assets, average 9 % daily rental yield paid in stablecoins. Minimum investment $50.

- Binaryx Bali Surf Villas (2022–2025)
  Cliff-top villas minutes from Uluwatu tokenized at $50–$100 per token. Secondary market premiums 15–40 %, 10–12 % rental APY.

- NewGen IVF Beachfront UAE (2025)
  $45 M plot tokenized for $400 M luxury dev. Same wrapper logic as Costa Rica (local entity → offshore LLC → tokens).

Every single one of these projects hit or exceeded their raise in weeks, not years.

Chapter 7 – Why 2026 - 2030 Is the Perfect Window\*\*

- Tokenized real-world assets are no longer experimental

- Costa Rica has zero crypto bans and is actively courting digital nomads

- Fairmint is an SEC-registered Transfer Agent → Reg CF raises up to $5 M with almost zero friction

- Southern Costa Rica luxury inventory is at historic lows

- The wave itself is the ultimate moat

**Final Chapter – How to Own a Piece of the Longest Wave on Earth**

The Reg CF portal goes live [date will be here when live]\*\*Minimum investment: $100
Whitelist + early-bird bonus (extra 10 % tokens): [link will be here when live]

You don’t need to be a millionaire to own a piece of the best surf point most people will never find on a map.

Epilogue – When the Last Barrel Becomes the First Block\*\*

Years from now, when the villa’s solar panels glow amber against the jungle night and the co-working rancho is full of builders shipping code between sets, someone will kick out of a two-minute wave, walk up the sand, and pour a cold Imperial for the kid from Portugal who owns 0.03 % of the place. They’ll clink bottles under the same palms that watched Robert August shape the first board here in 1962. The kid will never have met the original owners in person.
He won’t need to. His tokens will have paid for the reforestation project that kept the point wild. His quarterly yield will have bought the new desalination plant.
And when he finally surfs the wave that his $3,200 bought him a piece of, he’ll understand something profound: The best things in life aren’t scarce because there aren’t enough of them. They’re scarce because nobody figured out how to share them fairly.

Until now.

The longest wave on earth just went permissionless.
The next set is forming.

## Conclusion

See you at the point.
Bring your board… and your wallet.

Pura Vida, forever onchain.
