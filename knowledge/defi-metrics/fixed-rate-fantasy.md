Even in 2025, floating-rate money markets dominate—and that’s not changing anytime soon. I came across a sharp thread the other day dissecting why fixed-rate lending has repeatedly failed to take center stage in DeFi. It wasn’t just another hot take; it cut to the structural heart of the matter. A couple years on, with RWAs finally scaling and yields compressing across the board, the thesis holds up remarkably well. This is my response.

DeFi Built Money Markets, Not Credit Markets\*\*

## Context

Fixed-rate lending sounds inevitable. Borrowers crave certainty: a predictable payment schedule, no surprise repricing when rates spike. Lenders, in theory, should demand a premium for locking capital. If DeFi is ever going to mirror real finance, fixed terms feel essential.

Yet here we are, late 2025, and the pattern repeats. Floating-rate pools like Aave command $40–$50 billion in TVL across chains. Morpho and Spark aren’t far behind. Pure fixed-rate plays? Notional lingers in the low hundreds of millions. Term Finance auctions clear modestly. Even the clever tranches from Pendle—now pushing $10–$13 billion TVL—mostly fuel looping and basis trades rather than true long-term credit.

This isn’t accidental. It’s baked into the DNA of DeFi’s participants.

## Main

The Liquidity Premium Rules Everything

The core mismatch: DeFi lenders behave like mercenary cash managers, not patient bond holders. In TradFi, banks originate 30-year mortgages and fund them with deposits that don’t flee at the first sign of better yields. They warehouse duration risk through hedging, securitization, and deep intermediation. Someone always absorbs the mismatch when borrowers and lenders don’t align perfectly.

DeFi never built that infrastructure. Instead, we optimized for on-demand liquidity. Suppliers in Aave or Morpho get a token that’s instantly withdrawable, composable as collateral elsewhere, and rotatable when a hotter opportunity appears. They accept modestly lower yields for that optionality. As one analysis put it: “Lenders are paying for liquidity, composability, and the ability to reprice without overhead.” Fixed-rate products ask them to surrender that—for a duration premium that, in practice, rarely feels compelling enough.

Borrowers Don’t Want Duration Either

On the flip side, most on-chain borrowing isn’t for long-term financing. It’s tactical: leverage, basis trades, looping strategies, liquidation buffers.

Data from platforms like Aave shows the majority of debt tied to these short-horizon plays. Borrowers want the flexibility to refinance when rates drop or unwind quickly if markets turn. They’re structurally unwilling to pay a fat premium for certainty they don’t need.

Result? A perennial one-sided market. Lenders demand compensation for locking up; borrowers won’t pay it. Liquidity fragments across maturities. Early exits punish with discounts. Capital flees back to floating pools.

**The Numbers Tell the Story**

Fast-forward to December 2025.

DeFi lending TVL sits north of $55–$60 billion, with Aave alone often topping $40 billion. Floating-rate dominates.

Pendle has exploded to $10–$13 billion on the back of yield tokenization and RWA integrations—PTs (principal tokens) effectively offer fixed exposure. Yet even here, the bulk of activity is speculative looping (e.g., USDe strategies) rather than balance-sheet credit. Pendle’s growth proves structured fixed yield can scale, but as an overlay on floating markets, not a replacement.

**Notional and dedicated fixed lenders? Still niche, sub-$1 billion combined.**

RWAs have poured in—tokenized treasuries and private credit now exceed $20–$30 billion on-chain. Maple and Centrifuge lead undercollateralized pools. But these flow mostly into variable-rate vaults or get tranched for yield trading. Predictable payments matter more for RWAs, yet the capital still parks where liquidity is deepest: floating.

**Why Mechanisms Alone Didn’t Fix It**
\*\*
We’ve tried everything: auctions (Term Finance), zero-coupon bonds (Notional), maturity AMMs (early Yield Protocol), tranches (Pendle). Aave even approximated fixed borrowing in pooled systems.

Outcomes repeat because the issue isn’t UX or curves. It’s the mental model. Protocols built credit as a money-market variation—preserving passive deposits and pseudo-liquidity—while inheriting money-market constraints.

Fixed-rate isn’t a different quote. It’s a different product.

To scale, you need: locked capital tolerance, deep secondary markets, or duration warehousing (i.e., balance sheets). DeFi lenders reject the first. Secondaries remain thin. The third recreates banks—which most builders ideologically avoid.

The Hybrid Path Forward\*\*

I believe in the exponent. I believe crypto rails will underpin global finance. Stable, programmable credit is coming.

But fixed-rate won’t become DeFi’s default parking spot unless the lender base fundamentally shifts—from active traders to long-term savers and institutions with real balance sheets.

The realistic future: floating money markets as the flexible base layer where most capital lives. Fixed as an opt-in overlay—tranches, swaps, dedicated instruments—for those explicitly trading duration.

RWAs accelerate this bridge. Tokenized treasuries bring institutions wanting predictable yields. Private credit demands terms. But even they layer on top of variable pools for efficiency.

Patience is the edge here. DeFi isn’t failing fixed-rate; it’s just in a different phase. Money markets first, credit later.

I’m long the primitives that enable both (Aave, Morpho, Pendle). Short pure fixed-rate moonshots that ignore participant behavior.

Good luck out there.
