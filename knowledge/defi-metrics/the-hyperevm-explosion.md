## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **HyperEVM Dynamics:** Understanding the interplay of Layer 1 characteristics such as speed, cost, and composability to gauge the potential of a DeFi ecosystem.
- **Liquidity Provisioning (LP):** Analyzing the incentives and structures that make liquidity pools attractive, especially in high-yield environments.
- **Options Trading in DeFi:** Evaluating the benefits of options strategies (e.g., covered calls) and their impact on risk management and yield generation.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Adopt a **holistic view** of DeFi platforms by assessing their total value locked (TVL) against daily fees and buybacks. This helps in determining the sustainability and profitability of protocols.
- **Comparative analysis** with historical data of other platforms (like Solana) can shed light on emerging trends and potential market shifts, even if specific numbers may be outdated.
- **User behavior analysis** is crucial. Observe how changes in product features (like instant deposits or fee distributions) can shift user engagement and trading habits.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for **rapid growth signals** in user adoption (e.g., monthly growth rates) and liquidity increases in promising DeFi projects.
- Identify **incentive structures** that consistently reward users (such as high fee distributions to LPs) as they often correlate with platform success and user retention.
- Monitor **market sentiment** shifts, especially when new products are launched that significantly enhance user experience or returns.

**Strategic Framework:**
- When evaluating DeFi opportunities, establish a **framework for risk vs. reward** by analyzing potential yield against factors like liquidation risk and market volatility.
- Leverage **cross-chain capabilities** as a strategic advantage; assess projects that integrate multiple blockchains for better liquidity and user accessibility.
- Consider the **long-term sustainability** of revenue models, focusing on how transaction fees and buybacks are reinvested into the ecosystem to bolster growth and user trust.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

It’s now a full-blown Layer 1 with the fastest, cheapest, most composable EVM in existence — and it’s printing money like a 2021 Solana rerun, but with actual revenue and real buybacks. We’ve been living on HyperEVM since week one. We’ve LP’d millions on Project X, sold covered calls on Hypersurface until we forgot what leverage feels like, looped kHYPE until our wallets look like a Matryoshka doll, and watched the entire thing compound into the cleanest infrastructure bet we’ve ever had.

Here’s the no-bullshit breakdown of what’s actually happening right now.

## Context

The Big Picture Numbers (as of today)

- 
Hyperliquid total TVL: $6.7B

- 
HyperEVM-only TVL: $1.72B (up 337% YTD)

## Main

- 
Daily fees on HyperEVM: $3.3M

- 
Daily HYPE buybacks: $1–2M (real, on-chain, every block)

- 
DEX volume on HyperEVM: $857M / 24h

- 
Lending markets: >$1B borrowed

- 
Active wallets: 500K+ daily txns, Phantom/Rainbow native support

This chain is now more profitable per TVL than Solana ever was at its peak.

**Why HyperEVM Feels Like Cheating**

- 
Same wallet, same collateral for perps AND DeFi

- 
Sub-second finality, gas under $0.01

- 
Direct read/write to the perp orderbook from smart contracts (CoreWriter = god mode)

- 
No bridges needed — LI.FI/Wormhole deposits land instantly usable

- 
Every single fee flows back to HYPE buybacks (99% of protocol revenue)

It’s literally the first chain that feels better than a centralized exchange while staying fully on-chain. Our Two Favorite Apps (Where We Actually Keep Size)

1. Project X – The Uniswap That Actually Rewards You

Website: https://www.prjx.com/

We were there the day it launched with 46 tokens and a meme leaderboard. Today it’s the undisputed king of HyperEVM trading.

Current stats:

- 
TVL: $122M

- 
Cumulative volume: $13.5B

- 
Daily fees: ~$400K (3rd highest on the chain)

- 
Users: 50K+ and growing 4x MoM

What makes it special:

- 
86% of fees go straight to LPs

- 
1M points distributed daily (10% referral bonus)

- 
Full cross-chain aggregator (50+ chains, best price guaranteed)

- 
Phase 3 coming soon (redacted but everyone knows it’s big)

We keep 7-figures LP’d in the tight HYPE/USDC0 pools. IL is brutal when it happens, but the combo of fees + points + future PRJX token has been one of our best trades all year.

2. Hypersurface – The Options App That Broke Our Perps Addiction

Website: hypersurface.io

This is the one that actually changed our behavior. We used to run 20-40x on BTC and ETH perps like degenerates. Then we discovered we could deposit the same bags, sell weekly 10% OTM covered calls on HYPE, and collect 40-90% APR paid upfront in USDC.

Realized yields we’ve personally pulled:

- 
HYPE calls: 38–94% APR

- 
ETH calls: 32–57% APR

- 
BTC calls: 23–33% APR (spiked to 250% during vol events)

No liquidation risk. Premium hits your wallet instantly. If it expires OTM you keep the asset + premium. If exercised you still sell at a profit. We now run ~20% of our book through Hypersurface. It’s the closest thing crypto has to TradFi covered-call ETFs, but with 10-50x higher yield and zero trust.

The Rest of the Top 10 (Quick Hits)

- 
Kinetiq – $1.57B TVL liquid staking (we loop PT-kHYPE for 12-15% net)

- 
HyperLend – borrow HYPE at 0.67% (yes, really)

- 
Felix – mint feUSD against blue-chips, now launching TSLA perps

- 
Morpho – auto-compounding vaults, 20%+ yields

- 
HyperBeat – yield aggregator farming 20+ protocols for us while we sleep

- 
HyperSwap – the clean ve(3,3) DEX

- 
Upshift, Hyperdrive, Looped – all printing points and yield

Every single one of these routes fees → HYPE buybacks.

The Math That Keeps Us Up at Night (In a Good Way)

- 
Current HYPE price: ~$33

- 
FDV: $33B

- 
Annualized revenue run-rate: ~$1.2B

- 
P/E: ~27x (cheap for 97% margins and 73% perps market share)

- 
Daily buyback absorption already covers ~17% of the upcoming linear unlock

Base case 2027: $97**Bull case 2027: $210
2030 cycle peak: $300+ 

Risks (Because We’re Not Bagholders, We’re Investors)

- 
Linear unlock starts Nov 29 (237M tokens over 24 months)

- 
Still only 16 validators and partially closed-source

- 
Regulatory question marks around HIP-3 equity perps

- 
Too much money flowing in too fast (classic crypto problem)

None of these feel existential yet. The buyback engine is real. The product is undeniably better than anything else out there.

Final Takeaway**

HyperEVM is the first DeFi ecosystem that actually feels like an upgrade from centralized finance. We’re long HYPE in size. We’re LP’d on Project X.
We’re selling calls on Hypersurface. We’re looping everything else through Kinetiq and HyperLend. This is the cleanest flywheel we’ve seen since early Solana — except this one actually burns the token with real revenue. If you’re still sleeping on Hyperliquid because “it’s just a perps DEX”… wake up. The perps were just the trojan horse.

## Conclusion

P.S. The chain never sleeps. Neither should you. We are long HYPE and deep in the HyperEVM ecosystem. This is not financial advice. DYOR. Never log off.
