# Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)

## Methodology & Framework

Account abstraction is evaluated through **user experience gains** (what UX patterns become possible?), **security model changes** (how does the trust surface shift from EOAs to smart accounts?), and **ecosystem readiness** (tooling, bundler infrastructure, paymaster availability). ERC-4337 is assessed as both a standard and a live infrastructure layer.

## The EOA Problem

Ethereum's original account model forces every user into the same box: an externally owned account (EOA) controlled by a single private key. Lose the key, lose everything. No spending limits, no social recovery, no batched transactions, no gas abstraction. Every interaction requires ETH for gas. This is the UX equivalent of requiring users to understand TCP handshakes before browsing the web.

ERC-4337 doesn't modify the protocol layer — it builds account abstraction on top of existing Ethereum using a system of smart accounts, bundlers, paymasters, and an EntryPoint contract.

## Core Architecture

### Smart Accounts

A smart account is a contract that serves as the user's primary account. Because it's programmable, it can implement arbitrary validation logic:

- **Multi-signature**: require 2-of-3 keys to authorize transactions
- **Session keys**: grant temporary, scoped permissions (e.g., "this game can spend up to 0.1 ETH on my behalf for the next hour")
- **Spending limits**: daily/weekly caps that don't require hardware wallet confirmation
- **Social recovery**: a set of guardians (friends, institutions, other devices) can rotate the signing key if lost

The user signs a **UserOperation** (UserOp) — a pseudo-transaction that describes what the smart account should do. This UserOp enters an alternative mempool.

### Bundlers

Bundlers are nodes that collect UserOps from the alt mempool, bundle them into a single transaction, and submit it to the EntryPoint contract on-chain. They serve the same role as block builders but for the UserOp layer.

Bundlers earn fees from the UserOps they include. The bundler market is competitive — Pimlico, Stackup, Alchemy, and Biconomy all run bundler infrastructure. The risk of centralization exists but is mitigated by the permissionless nature of bundling: anyone can run a bundler.

### Paymasters

Paymasters are the gas abstraction primitive. A paymaster contract can sponsor gas for UserOps, enabling **gasless transactions** for end users. The paymaster pays ETH for gas; the user pays nothing, or pays in ERC-20 tokens, or the dApp subsidizes the cost.

Use cases:
- **Onboarding**: new users interact with dApps without first acquiring ETH
- **ERC-20 gas payment**: pay gas in USDC, DAI, or any token the paymaster accepts
- **Subscription models**: dApps sponsor gas for active users as a retention tool
- **Cross-chain gas**: paymasters on destination chains can sponsor gas for bridged users

Paymasters are where the business model lives. Visa ran a paymaster experiment on StarkNet. Coinbase's Base chain uses paymasters extensively for onboarding.

### Session Keys

Session keys are perhaps the most underrated primitive in the stack. A session key is a temporary, scoped signing key that a smart account grants to an application. Parameters:

- **Time-bound**: expires after N minutes/hours
- **Action-scoped**: can only call specific contracts or functions
- **Value-limited**: can only spend up to X tokens
- **Chain-specific**: valid only on designated chains

This enables "approve once, play for an hour" UX in games, "auto-compound my yield" in DeFi, and "sign me in for this session" in social apps — all without repeated wallet popups.

## Social Recovery

Social recovery replaces seed phrases with a guardian-based model. The user designates a set of guardians (other wallets, institutions, hardware devices). If the primary key is lost, a threshold of guardians can authorize a key rotation.

Vitalik has advocated for this model since 2021. Implementations vary: Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) uses a modular guardian system, Argent uses phone + guardian + email combinations, and Soul Wallet implements ERC-4337-native recovery flows.

The tradeoff: guardian liveness and coordination. If guardians lose interest or lose their own keys, recovery fails. Hybrid models (institutional guardian + personal devices + social contacts) mitigate this.

## Current State

ERC-4337 is live on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and most major L2s. Over 50M smart accounts have been deployed. The infrastructure layer (bundlers, paymasters, SDKs) is maturing rapidly — Pimlico, ZeroDev, Biconomy, and Alchemy provide full-stack AA toolkits.

ERC-7702 (shipping with Pectra) lets EOAs temporarily delegate to smart contract logic, bridging the gap for existing users who don't want to migrate accounts. Combined with ERC-4337, this creates a path where every Ethereum account eventually behaves as a smart account.
