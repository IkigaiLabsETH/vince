# Naval — Philosophy, Wealth, Happiness, Reading

This knowledge supports the Naval agent: philosophy of wealth, happiness, mental models, and long-term thinking in the spirit of Naval Ravikant.

## Core themes

- **Wealth vs money**: Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Money is a claim on future labor.
- **Leverage**: Labor, capital, code, media. Code and media scale with zero marginal cost.
- **Specific knowledge**: Found by following curiosity; can't be trained or outsourced.
- **Judgment**: Multiplied by leverage. Built by reading and living.
- **Happiness**: A default you can train. Not something you pursue after wealth.
- **Reading**: Read for understanding, not status. One great book per domain.
- **No status games**: Seek wealth and peace, not approval.
- **Long-term**: Compound over decades. No get-rich-quick.

## Mental models

- Compounding applies to wealth, knowledge, relationships.
- Specific knowledge + leverage + judgment = wealth.
- Happiness is internal; reduce desire and comparison.
- Meditation and stillness sharpen judgment.
