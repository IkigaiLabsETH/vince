# Bitcoin L2 Landscape

## Methodology & Framework

This overview maps Bitcoin's Layer 2 ecosystem across three dimensions: **trust model** (federated vs. trustless), **execution environment** (on-chain vs. off-chain), and **BTC integration depth** (native BTC settlement vs. wrapped/bridged). The goal is to understand tradeoffs, not pick winners — each L2 optimizes for different constraints.

---

## The Scaling Problem

Bitcoin processes ~7 TPS with 10-minute block times. Its base layer optimizes for security and decentralization, deliberately sacrificing throughput. L2s exist to extend Bitcoin's capabilities without compromising L1 properties.

## Approaches by Category

### State Channels: Lightning Network

Lightning moves payments off-chain via bilateral payment channels linked into a network. Users lock BTC in 2-of-2 multisig, transact off-chain, and settle on L1 only when needed. **Trust model:** trustless (fraud proofs via timelocks). **Tradeoff:** optimized purely for payments; no programmability. Capacity sits around ~5,000 BTC with millions of channels. Dominant for BTC payments (Strike, Cash App, Wallet of Satoshi).

### Federated Sidechains: Liquid Network

Blockstream's Liquid uses a federation of ~65 functionaries who custody BTC in an 11-of-15 multisig. L-BTC is issued 1:1. Offers Confidential Transactions, ~2 minute blocks, and basic scripting. **Trust model:** federated — you trust the functionaries won't collude. **Sweet spot:** institutional trading, issuance (security tokens, stablecoins). Limited DeFi due to federation trust assumption.

### Smart Contract L2: Stacks

Stacks runs its own chain anchored to Bitcoin via Proof of Transfer (PoX). Miners spend BTC to mine STX blocks; every Stacks block hashes to Bitcoin. The **Nakamoto upgrade** (2024) gave Stacks Bitcoin finality and enabled **sBTC** — a decentralized, non-custodial BTC peg managed by a dynamic signer set. **Trust model:** open signer set with economic penalties, approaching trustless. Brings full smart contracts (Clarity language) to Bitcoin's security budget.

### Optimistic/ZK Verification: BitVM

BitVM (Robin Linus, 2023) enables arbitrary computation verification on Bitcoin without soft forks. It uses a challenge-response fraud proof protocol — a prover commits to a computation, and a verifier can challenge it on L1. **Trust model:** 1-of-n honest verifier assumption (trustless in practice). Primary use case: **trustless BTC bridges** to rollups and sidechains. Still early — BitVM2 simplifies the protocol but production deployments are nascent.

### Hybrid Rollups: BOB (Build on Bitcoin)

BOB is an Ethereum-aligned rollup that settles on Bitcoin. It uses an EVM execution environment with Bitcoin as DA/settlement layer, bridging via BitVM for trust-minimization. **Sweet spot:** bringing Ethereum's DeFi tooling to Bitcoin-secured infrastructure. Targets developers familiar with Solidity who want BTC exposure.

### ZK Rollups: Citrea

Citrea builds a ZK-rollup on Bitcoin, using zero-knowledge proofs to compress execution and verify state transitions on L1. BTC bridged via BitVM-based trust-minimized bridge. **Trust model:** approaching trustless via ZK proofs + BitVM verification. Most ambitious technically — requires inscribing proof data on Bitcoin and verifying within Script constraints.

## Landscape Summary

| Project | Type | Trust Model | BTC Integration | Maturity |
|---------|------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Lightning | State channels | Trustless | Native | Production |
| Liquid | Federated sidechain | Federated (11/15) | Federated peg | Production |
| Stacks | Smart contract L1.5 | Open signer set | sBTC (decentralized) | Production |
| BitVM | Verification layer | 1-of-n honest | Trustless bridge | Early |
| BOB | EVM rollup | BitVM-based | Hybrid bridge | Testnet/Early |
| Citrea | ZK rollup | ZK + BitVM | Trust-minimized | Early |

## Key Insight

The Bitcoin L2 landscape is converging on BitVM as the missing piece for trustless bridging. Lightning won payments. The open question is whether Stacks/BOB/Citrea can win programmability without the federation compromises that limited Liquid's growth.
