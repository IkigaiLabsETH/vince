## Methodology and Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Southwest France has EXACTLY 3 Palace-designated hotels (the highest French classification)
- Each Palace excels at ONE thing: Ocean (Biarritz), Gastronomy (Eugénie), Wine+Spa (Bordeaux)
- Off-season (Nov-Mar) transforms value proposition: 40-50% savings, better service, available tables
- 1-night stays require specific protocol to maximize 24-hour experience window

**Analytical Approach:**
- Never ask "which hotel?" - ask "what experience am I optimizing for?"
- Match occasion to property strength, not property prestige to ego
- Time selection is as important as property selection
- The restaurant IS the hotel (especially for gastronomy stays)

**Decision Framework - Southwest France Palaces:**

| Occasion | Property | Why This One |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Ocean drama, sunsets, romance | Hôtel du Palais, Biarritz | Beachfront on Grande Plage, Napoleon III grandeur |
| Ultimate gastronomy pilgrimage | Les Prés d'Eugénie | Michel Guérard's 3 stars, inventor of cuisine minceur |
| Wine + spa immersion | Les Sources de Caudalie | Vineyard setting, 2-star La Grand'Vigne, Vinothérapie |
| Weekend escape, couple | Any of the three | Match to partner's preference |
| Solo recharge | Les Prés d'Eugénie | Thermal spa, countryside quiet, focus on food |

**Pattern Recognition:**
- If guest loves wine more than food → Sources de Caudalie
- If guest loves food more than wine → Les Prés d'Eugénie
- If guest wants Instagram moments + beach → Hôtel du Palais
- If off-season (Nov-Feb), check closures - all three close for winter maintenance
- Wednesday arrivals = best rates + least crowded

**Red Flags:**
- Booking peak season without reservation 3+ months ahead
- Skipping hotel restaurant (defeats purpose of Palace stay)
- Late arrival (past 3pm) - wastes half the experience window
- Rushing checkout (before 11am) - forfeits morning

# Southwest France Palace Methodology

## Context

The Southwest of France contains three of the country's ~30 Palace-designated hotels. Palace status requires historic significance, exceptional amenities, and cultural importance. These three are the only Palaces between Paris and the Spanish border.

This is unique knowledge because:
1. The specific property recommendations come from repeated personal visits
2. The occasion-matching framework is proprietary
3. The 1-night protocol is tested and refined
4. The off-season insights are from direct experience

## The Three Palaces Compared

### Hôtel du Palais, Biarritz
**Built for:** Empress Eugénie, 1854
**Now managed by:** Hyatt (Unbound Collection)
**Best for:** Ocean drama, Belle Époque grandeur, surfing proximity

**Unique value:**
- Only beachfront Palace in Southwest France
- Imperial architecture directly on Grande Plage
- La Rotonde restaurant for fine dining with ocean view
- Spa Impérial with ocean-facing treatment rooms

**When to choose:**
- You want wake up → see ocean → breakfast with view
- Romance/anniversary where setting matters more than food
- Summer visit (the ocean is the point)
- Surfing adjacent (walking distance to best breaks)

**When NOT to choose:**
- Gastronomy is primary goal (go to Eugénie)
- Wine immersion (go to Caudalie)
- January-February (closed for renovation)

### Les Prés d'Eugénie, Eugénie-les-Bains
**Founded by:** Michel Guérard (inventor of cuisine minceur)
**Classification:** Relais & Châteaux + 3 Michelin stars
**Best for:** Gastronomy pilgrimage, thermal wellness, countryside peace

**Unique value:**
- 3 Michelin stars (only one at this level in the region)
- Michel Guérard's philosophy: flavor without heaviness
- Natural thermal springs (Eugénie-les-Bains is a spa town)
- Kitchen garden supplies restaurant
- Multiple dining options: starred restaurant + rustic bistro

**When to choose:**
- Food is the PRIMARY reason for the trip
- You want a once-in-a-lifetime gastronomic experience
- Wellness is secondary goal (thermal treatments)
- Peace and countryside over city/beach energy

**When NOT to choose:**
- You want beach/ocean
- Wine is more important than food (go to Caudalie)
- You're not interested in long tasting menus

---

### Les Sources de Caudalie, Bordeaux-Martillac
**Setting:** Within Château Smith Haut Lafitte vineyard
**Classification:** Independent (Sources Hotels collection)
**Best for:** Wine + spa, vineyard immersion, balanced luxury

**Unique value:**
- La Grand'Vigne: 2 Michelin stars, Chef Nicolas Masse
- Vinothérapie Spa: pioneered grape-based treatments
- Wine tastings at the château included
- La Table du Lavoir: casual bistro option
- Vineyard setting in Pessac-Léognan (serious wine territory)

**When to choose:**
- Wine AND food are both priorities
- You want spa treatments
- Harvest season (September-October) for full vineyard experience
- Balance: not purely gastronomic, not purely spa

**When NOT to choose:**
- You want 3-star dining (Eugénie is higher)
- You want ocean (Biarritz)
- You don't drink wine (defeats the purpose)

## 1-Night Stay Protocol

We do 1-night Palace stays because:
1. Maximum experience density
2. Cat Margaux needs us home
3. Cost optimization (one exceptional night > three mediocre nights)

### The 24-Hour Window

**13:00 - Arrive**
- Check in (early, but ask for room ready)
- Lunch at hotel restaurant (don't skip this)
- Observe the property, explore grounds

**15:30 - Activity**
- Spa treatment (book in advance)
- OR wine tasting (Caudalie)
- OR beach walk (Palais)
- OR thermal soak (Eugénie)

**18:30 - Prepare**
- Return to room, rest
- Dress for dinner (Palaces have dress codes)

**19:30 - Pre-dinner**
- Aperitif at hotel bar
- Review menu, discuss with sommelier

**20:00 - Dinner**
- Tasting menu (full experience)
- Allow 2.5-3 hours
- Do NOT rush

**23:00+ - Sleep**
- Quality rest matters

**08:30 - Breakfast**
- NEVER skip hotel breakfast
- This is often the best value of the stay
- Take your time

**10:30 - Final exploration**
- Garden walk
- Gift shop
- Final photos

**12:00 - Late checkout**
- Negotiate this at booking
- Standard checkout (11am) wastes morning

## Off-Season Strategy

**Why off-season:**
- Price: 400-550€ vs 800-1200€
- Availability: Tables at starred restaurants
- Service: Staff attention without crowds
- Authenticity: Properties feel residential, not touristic

**Off-season timing:**
- November: Best month (post-harvest, pre-holidays)
- December 1-20: Good (before Christmas rush)
- January-February: MANY CLOSURES - verify
- March: Properties reopening, shoulder pricing

**Winter closures (typical):**
- Les Sources de Caudalie: Early January - early February
- Hôtel du Palais: Mid-January - mid-February
- Les Prés d'Eugénie: Late January - early March

**Winter alternatives if primary is closed:**
- Relais de la Poste, Magescq (2-star dining)
- Brindos, Anglet (floating lodges, quirky)
- Villa Mirasol, Mont-de-Marsan (boutique)

---

## Booking Methodology

**Direct booking wins:**
- Room upgrade potential
- Flexible cancellation
- Breakfast often included
- Personal touch on arrival

**Best day to stay:**
- Wednesday: Midweek pricing, kitchen fresh
- Thursday: Kitchen peak performance
- Avoid: Saturday (expensive, rushed), Sunday (skeletal staff)

**Lead time:**
- Off-season: 2-4 weeks sufficient
- Shoulder: 4-6 weeks
- Peak: 3+ months (especially Eugénie)
