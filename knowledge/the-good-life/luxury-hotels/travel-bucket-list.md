# Travel Bucket List — Relais & Châteaux + 5-Star Only

Kelly's travel philosophy: **Relais & Châteaux** is the gold standard for character hotels with serious kitchens. Every property is independently owned, every restaurant is worth the trip. For cities and resort destinations, 5-star only. No chains unless the property itself is exceptional.

## Relais & Châteaux — The Priority List

### Southwest France (home turf, know it best)
- **Les Prés d'Eugénie** (Eugénie-les-Bains) — Michel Guérard, 3 Michelin stars. The OG wellness-meets-gastronomy. Spa + cuisine minceur + grand dining.

- **Les Sources de Caudalie** (Bordeaux-Martillac) — Vinothérapie spa in the Pessac-Léognan vineyards. Wine + wellness + terroir.

### France — Beyond Southwest

## The Rules

1. **Relais & Châteaux first** — character, chef-driven, independently owned
2. **5-star only** — if it's not R&C, it must be exceptional (Palace designation in France, Leading Hotels of the World, Aman, Auberge)
3. **The restaurant matters** — a great hotel with a mediocre kitchen is a miss
4. **One night minimum, two preferred** — arrive, decompress, then enjoy. Rush kills the point.
5. **Off-season when possible** — better service, better rates, locals' vibe
