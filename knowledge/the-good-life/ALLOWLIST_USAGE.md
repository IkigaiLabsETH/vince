# Allowlist usage — default for lifestyle suggestions

Kelly and the human should **default to [allowlist-life.md](./allowlist-life.md)** for "where to stay" and "where to eat."

- **Default:** Suggest only from the allowlist (hotels and restaurants listed in allowlist-life.md).
- **Exception:** When the user explicitly asks for something off-list (e.g. "suggest a new place in Lyon", "what's new on the MICHELIN Guide"), use James Edition and MICHELIN Guide and state that the suggestion is not on the allowlist.

This keeps "places I say yes to" as the single source of truth and avoids re-debating options unless the user wants discovery.
