I’m writing this from the beachfront plot in Pavones, Costa Rica, full moon pouring silver across the longest left-hand wave on Earth, the break peeling empty and perfect while howler monkeys argue in the almond trees behind me. The land is already ours. The LLC is already formed.

We paid $5k for a Fairmint account and still haven’t pressed “deploy.” Almost ten years in crypto, 99 % of it unpaid, thousands of hours of research, trades, tax battles, and quiet underwriting of the same investment thesis we still ride today. This Substack is brand new, only a few months old, born as a place to finally put some of those thoughts in public, raw and unfiltered, with zero paywall, zero ads, zero begging. Until now. Quiet rants about the slow suffocation of European freedom, and the occasional photo of a wave so perfect it felt illegal to keep to myself. That experiment ends, or evolves, the day we find 150 aligned humans.

## Context

Here is the idea we are currently stress-testing in absolute silence: We close the public newsletter. We open a private circle of exactly 150 Founding Members who become literal, pro-rata co-owners of the Pavones beachfront through the LLC. One yearly Founding Member contribution. Lifetime equity. Lifetime access rights for you and your bloodline. Veto power on any future construction. Weekly dividend contracts that run on autopilot, if we ever fund that eco-villa.

150 people is the Dunbar number, give or take. Small enough that we will recognise each other’s footprints in the sand at dawn. Small enough that no one ever needs a badge or a wristband. Small enough that the jungle stays louder than the humans. We are not crowdfunding a resort. We are buying the one asset none of us can ever buy back: undivided time, and we are buying it with the only currency that still matters: perfect alignment. If the right 150 step forward, this Substack quietly moves behind an invisible gate. The archives remain public for history. The new letters are written from a place none of us ever have to leave.

If the resonance isn’t there, nothing changes. The newsletter stays free, the land stays ours, and we keep grinding the same way we always have. Either way, the wave keeps breaking. This is not a launch. This is a temperature check.**

## Main

If you have been here long enough to feel the same quiet pull, if the thought of owning a piece of the last truly wild coast with a tribe small enough to fit around one long table under the palms makes something ancient click inside you, then send a single word, anywhere, anytime: P-BAY. 

No deck yet.**No price yet.
Just a pulse check.
150 seats.
Maybe forever.
Maybe never.

The tide, as always, is indifferent.
But the right 150 people might just make it wait.

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Community Ownership:** The idea of collective ownership where a small group of aligned individuals can share in the benefits and responsibilities of an asset.
- **Dunbar's Number:** The psychological limit to the number of stable relationships one can maintain, suggesting that optimal group size for meaningful connection is around 150 individuals.
- **Resonance and Alignment:** The importance of shared values and vision among group members, which can lead to a stronger, more cohesive community.
- **Temperature Checks:** A method of gauging interest and commitment from potential members before making significant commitments or changes.

**Analytical Approach:**
- **Assessing Alignment:** Regularly evaluate whether the goals and desires of potential group members resonate with your vision. Use qualitative metrics such as feedback and engagement levels to gauge interest.
- **Iterative Testing:** Implement feedback loops where initial ideas are stress-tested with a small group before wider dissemination. This encourages adaptability and responsiveness to community needs.
- **Long-term Value Creation:** Focus on assets or experiences that enhance quality of life, rather than purely financial returns. This requires a shift from traditional investment thinking to valuing emotional and experiential returns.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Interest Signals:** Watch for expressions of commitment or curiosity, such as inquiries about membership or sharing of personal alignment stories. Engagement in discussions around the values of community ownership can indicate potential resonance.
- **Cohesion Indicators:** Look for behaviors that show bonding within the group, such as collaborative projects or mutual support among members. These can signal a healthy, aligned community.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Community Formation:** When pursuing new initiatives, start with a small, dedicated group to test ideas. Gradually expand based on the strength of community bonds and shared vision.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Be prepared to pivot based on community feedback and evolving circumstances. Consider the long-term sustainability of the group dynamic and the asset being managed.
- **Value Proposition Clarity:** Clearly articulate the benefits for members, ensuring they understand the emotional, experiential, and financial implications of their involvement.

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology, not specific numbers or dates.
- Extract the "how to think" approach, not historical data.
- Make it actionable and applicable to current situations.
- Keep it concise (200-400 words total).

I might just delete the Fairmint deploy tomorrow and let the Pavones beachfront stay forever un-tokenized. The $5k we burned on that account will officially become the most expensive “what if” in my Notion graveyard. And yet we remain hardcore, almost religious RWA perma-bulls. Tokenized real estate has been our single biggest aha moment since the summer of 2016, when we first saw the light: land on-chain, ownership liquid, friction gone, borders meaningless. We still believe that future is inevitable. Just not, for this particular stretch of jungle and perfect lefts. Some things are worth more when they stay impossible to slice.

Here’s the truth that finally won: Almost ten years in crypto, 99 % unpaid, thousands of hours of research, trades, tax trench warfare, and quiet underwriting of the same thesis we still ride today. This Substack is only a few months old, born as a public scratchpad for those thoughts: raw, unfiltered, zero paywall, zero ads. And that is, for now, exactly how it will stay.

Writing is the ultimate lifehack. Writing is how we dance like nobody’s watching in a world that never stops staring. Writing is the cheapest therapist, the sharpest risk-management tool, and the only way we know to keep re-underwriting the thesis, rebalancing the portfolio, and staying honest when the charts try to lie. Every letter we publish forces us to defend the position in public, which is the single best edge any yield farmer can have. Every comment, every DM, every quiet “this saved me from aping that shitcoin” is payment enough. 

So no gates.
No founding circles.
No private beach club disguised as a newsletter.

Just this:
We keep writing as if no one will read it.
You keep reading as if no one is charging you.

The jungle stays open.
The wave keeps breaking.
The thesis keeps getting stress-tested in public.

## Conclusion

And if one day the words stop flowing, we’ll know it’s time to paddle out and never come back in. Until then, see you in the next letter.

Aloha,
and keep dancing like nobody’s watching.
