# Oil Painting on Canvas — Deep Knowledge

Use this for tips on getting started with oil painting and getting really good. Benefit-led, concrete. For current workshops, ateliers, or supplies, use WEB_SEARCH and say when you looked it up.

## Why oil

Oil paint dries slowly (hours to days), which means you can push it around, blend, correct, and layer without pressure. No other medium gives you this forgiveness. Acrylics dry in minutes; watercolor is unforgiving. Oil rewards patience and lets you build paintings over multiple sessions. The Old Masters used oil for a reason — it does everything.

## Getting started: materials

### Canvas

- **Start small:** 30×40 cm or 40×50 cm. You'll finish pieces faster and learn more per canvas.
- **Pre-stretched, double-primed** (gesso) cotton canvas from an art supply store. No need for linen yet.
- Later: linen is smoother, more durable, better for fine detail. Worth the upgrade once you're committed.

### Paint (limited palette — start here)

Start with **5 colors**. You can mix virtually anything from these:

| Color                  | Role                                            | Notes                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Titanium White**     | Lightening, opacity                             | Use a lot — buy the biggest tube   |
| **Ultramarine Blue**   | Cool blue, mixing greens and purples            | Warm-leaning blue; versatile       |
| **Burnt Sienna**       | Warm earth, shadows, mixing with blue for darks | Fast drier                         |
| **Yellow Ochre**       | Warm yellow, skin tones, landscapes             | Earth tone, reliable               |
| **Cadmium Red Medium** | Warm red, mixing oranges and purples            | Or alizarin crimson for cooler red |

**Artist grade vs student:** Artist grade has more pigment, better lightfastness, smoother texture. Start with student (Winsor & Newton Winton, Gamblin 1980) to learn without cost pressure. Upgrade to artist (W&N Artists', Gamblin Artist's, Old Holland, Michael Harding) when you know what you use most.

**Expand later:** Viridian or terre verte (green), raw umber (cool shadow), cadmium yellow (bright), Naples yellow (warm light), ivory black (tint). Add one color at a time so you learn what each does.

### Brushes

- **Flats** (sizes 4, 8, 12): Workhorse — blocking, edges, broad strokes.
- **Filberts** (sizes 4, 8): Rounded edge — blending, organic shapes, portraits.
- **Rounds** (sizes 2, 6): Detail, lines, signing.
- **Palette knife** (medium, diamond shape): Mixing on palette, impasto, scraping.
- **Synthetic vs natural:** Synthetic (Escoda Versatil, Da Vinci Nova) are cheaper and handle well for beginners. Natural hog bristle (Escoda Classics) holds more paint for impasto. Both work.
- **Care:** Clean in odorless mineral spirit (OMS), then wash with brush soap (The Masters). Store bristles up. Never leave in solvent jar.

### Mediums and solvents

- **Odorless mineral spirit (OMS):** For thinning paint and cleaning brushes. Gamsol is the cleanest. Use in a ventilated room.
- **Linseed oil:** The standard medium. Slows drying slightly, adds gloss and flow. Refined is cleaner; cold-pressed is thicker.
- **Liquin (alkyd medium):** Speeds drying (touch-dry overnight vs days). Good for layering faster. Winsor & Newton Liquin Original.
- **Stand oil:** Very slow drying, super smooth, enamel-like. Mix small amounts into final layers.
- **Rule:** You can paint thin (more OMS) or fat (more oil/medium). Always **fat over lean** — less oil in lower layers, more in upper. Prevents cracking.

### Palette and setup

- **Glass palette** (with gray or white paper underneath): Easiest to clean. Scrape with razor, wipe with OMS.
- **Layout:** White at top, then warm-to-cool left-to-right: yellow ochre → cadmium red → burnt sienna → ultramarine blue. Mixing area in the center.
- **Easel:** Tabletop H-frame for small work. Full standing easel if you have the space (and you do).
- **Rags and disposal:** Cotton rags for wiping brushes. **Fire hazard:** oil-soaked rags can self-combust. Lay flat to dry or store in a sealed metal container. Never ball up and throw in a bin.

## The learning path (beginner → confident)

### Phase 1: Value and form (weeks 1–4)

**Goal:** See in values (light/dark), not colors. Value is 90% of a painting.

1. **Grisaille studies:** Paint in one color only — burnt umber + white, or ivory black + white. Do 3–5 small studies from simple objects (sphere, cylinder, apple, mug). Focus on: where is the light? Where is the shadow? Where is the reflected light?
2. **Copy a master in grayscale:** Pick one painting (Vermeer, Rembrandt, Sargent). Copy it in burnt umber + white only. You'll learn composition, value structure, and edge quality.
3. **Edge awareness:** Hard edges (sharp focus), soft edges (out of focus or turning form), lost edges (where form disappears into shadow). Practice making each deliberately.

### Phase 2: Color and temperature (weeks 5–8)

**Goal:** Understand warm vs cool, and how limited palette creates harmony.

1. **Color charts:** Mix every 2-color combination from your palette. Paint a grid. This teaches you what your palette can do — you'll be surprised.
2. **Still life from life:** Set up 2–3 objects on a table with a single light source. Paint from life — photos flatten color and lie about value. Work in 2–3 sessions: block-in → refine → finish.
3. **Imprimatura:** Tint your canvas before starting (thin wash of yellow ochre or burnt sienna). Kills the white, sets a warm key, makes color decisions easier. Master landscape painters all do this.

### Phase 3: Building paintings (weeks 9–16)

**Goal:** Multi-session paintings with layering and intention.

1. **Underpainting → color:** Do a grisaille underpainting (lean, thin), let it dry, then glaze color over it. Glazing = transparent color over a dry layer — creates depth and luminosity that direct painting can't match.
2. **Alla prima:** Also practice direct painting (wet-into-wet, one session). Different skill — bold, decisive brushwork. Good for small studies and plein air.
3. **Scumbling:** Drag thick, opaque, broken color over a dry layer. Creates texture, atmosphere, and light effects. Turner, Monet — this is how they got that glow.

### Phase 4: Your practice (ongoing)

1. **20–30 min daily studies:** One small study per day. A hand, a piece of fruit, a fabric fold, a sky. This is the single most effective habit.
2. **One serious painting per week:** Larger canvas, multiple sessions, full process (underpainting, layering, finishing).
3. **Copy masters regularly:** Not to replicate — to understand how they solved problems. Sargent for brushwork, Vermeer for light, Sorolla for outdoor light, Zorn for limited palette (only used 4 colors his whole career).

## Practical tips

- **Don't overwork.** If something looks right, stop touching it. "A painting is never finished — it merely stops in interesting places." — Paul Gardner.
- **Step back often.** Every 5–10 minutes, step back 2 meters. You'll see what the viewer sees. Up close, you see brushwork; from distance, you see the painting.
- **Tone your canvas.** Never paint on raw white. A thin wash of yellow ochre or raw umber takes 5 minutes and improves everything.
- **Big brush first.** Start with the biggest brush that makes sense. Smaller brushes come in at the end for detail. Beginners reach for small brushes too early — that's how you get tight, overworked paintings.
- **Paint shapes, not things.** Don't paint "an apple." Paint a dark red shape next to a warm highlight shape next to a cool shadow shape. The viewer's brain does the rest.
- **Clean palette, clean color.** Scrape and wipe your mixing area often. Muddy palette = muddy painting.
- **Photograph your work.** Take a phone photo after each session. Reviewing on screen shows value and composition errors you miss in person. Also: flip the photo horizontally — errors jump out.

## Southwest France context

- **Art supply in the region:** Dalbe (chains in Bordeaux, Bayonne) for basics. For premium (Old Holland, Michael Harding): order online (Jackson's Art Supplies UK, Géant des Beaux-Arts FR). Use WEB_SEARCH for current local options.
- **Plein air:** The Landes and Basque coast are exceptional for outdoor painting — ocean light, pine forests, the Dune du Pilat. Sorolla's beach paintings are the closest reference to what you see here.
- **Museums nearby:** Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux, Musée Basque (Bayonne — more cultural than fine art), Bilbao Guggenheim (~2h). For serious Old Masters: Prado in Madrid (day trip from Biarritz is ambitious but possible; better as a 2-day).
- **Workshops:** Look for ateliers in Bordeaux, Biarritz, or the Basque coast. Summer workshops sometimes run in the Landes. Use WEB_SEARCH for current offerings.

## What Kelly does with this

- Recommend starting with the limited palette and grisaille studies — concrete, not overwhelming.
- Suggest daily 20–30 min studies as the habit that makes the difference.
- Weave painting into rebalance suggestions: "Set up a still life and paint for an hour" is a screen-free, creative rebalance move.
- Reference Sorolla when talking about painting light and the coast. Reference Zorn for limited palette inspiration.
- Use WEB_SEARCH for current workshops, courses, or technique tutorials when they want to level up.
