## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate crypto and financial analysis through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to crypto and financial analysis
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated

# Oil painting on canvas — deep knowledge

Use this for tips on getting started with oil painting and getting really good. Benefit-led, concrete; no invented brands or prices. Prefer this doc or WEB_SEARCH; say when you looked it up.

## Materials

**Canvas:** Stretched and primed (gesso). Small sizes early on so you finish pieces and learn. Cotton vs linen; double-primed for oil.

**Brushes:** Sizes and shapes (flat, round, filbert); synthetic vs natural; care (clean with solvent or soap, store bristles up).

**Oils:** Student vs artist grade (pigment load, lightfastness). Drying times vary by pigment—earth colors fast, some blues slow. Limited palette reduces variables.

**Mediums:** Linseed oil (slow dry, glossy), stand oil (slower, smoother), alkyd medium (faster). Solvent (odorless mineral spirit) for thinning and cleanup. Fat-over-lean: less oil in early layers, more in later.

**Palette and cleanup:** Disposable or glass; layout (warm to cool, light to dark). Rags, jar for solvent, safe disposal.

## Limited palette

Start with 4–6 colors to learn value and temperature control without overwhelm. Typical starter set: titanium white, ultramarine blue, burnt sienna, yellow ochre. Add cadmium red (or equivalent) and a green (e.g. viridian or terre verte) as needed. You learn to mix secondaries and neutrals; expanding palette later is easy once you understand relationships.

## Fat-over-lean

Rule of thumb: thin layers first (more solvent, less oil), fatter layers later (more oil, less solvent). Prevents cracking and adhesion issues. Underpaint thin; build impasto or glazes in later layers. If in doubt, keep early layers lean.

---

## Underpainting and layering

**Grisaille:** Monochrome underpainting (e.g. burnt umber and white) to establish value and form before color. Speeds decisions and improves structure.

**Imprimatura:** Thin tint over the ground (e.g. warm gray or earth) to kill white and set a key. Optional but useful.

**Building form:** Block in shapes and values; refine; add color. Glazing (transparent color over dry layer) for depth; scumbling (opaque, broken) for texture. Let layers dry between sessions to avoid mud.

## Copying masters

Why: Learn composition, handling, and color from painters who solved similar problems. How: Museums (when possible), high-quality reproductions, or prints. Copy one painting start-to-finish; then do 20–30 minute studies (single element—hand, drapery, sky). Teaches more than theory alone.

---

## Getting really good

**Consistent practice:** Regular sessions beat rare marathons. Short daily studies (20–30 min) build skill; longer pieces when you have a block.

**Critique:** Compare your work to the master or reference; ask what’s off (value, drawing, edges). Self-critique and occasional feedback accelerate learning.

**Working from life vs photo:** Life teaches color and value; photos flatten and lie. Use both—life when you can, photos for reference with caution.

**Workshops and courses:** Use WEB_SEARCH for current oil painting workshops, ateliers, or online courses when the user wants to level up; say when you looked it up.
