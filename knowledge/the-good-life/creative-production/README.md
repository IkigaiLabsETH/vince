## Philosophy

Creative expression is an essential part of "the good life." These tools represent investments in quality and professional-grade capabilities that enable:

1. **Music**: Expressive performance and production with Ableton Push 3
2. **Photography**: Professional-quality image editing and workflow management
3. **Video**: Cinema-quality footage capture and Hollywood-grade post-production

## Knowledge Isolation
