# Hasselblad, Fuji, Capture One Pro — deep knowledge

Use this for the user's photography workflow: Hasselblad H2 (film), Hasselblad 555 ELD (digital back coming), Fuji (slow shutter), color grading in Capture One Pro. Practical, workflow-focused. No invented specs; prefer this doc, capture-one-pro, or WEB_SEARCH.

## Hasselblad H2 (film)

**Medium format 6x6:** Square format; waist-level or prism finder. Film stocks: 120 roll film; choice of color negative, slide, or black-and-white. Exposure: meter for shadows (negative) or highlights (slide); bracket when uncertain.

**Metering and reciprocity:** Built-in or handheld meter. Long exposures: reciprocity failure on film—expose longer than meter says at 1 s+; correction depends on stock. Use WEB_SEARCH for specific film reciprocity data when needed.

**Scanning vs darkroom:** Film can be scanned (drum, flatbed, or lab) for digital workflow, or printed in darkroom. For Capture One workflow, scanning (or lab scan) feeds raw files or TIFFs into sessions.

## Hasselblad 555 ELD + digital back

**Workflow when the back is in use:** Tethered or on-camera capture; files go to computer or card. Session-based in Capture One: one folder per shoot; quick culling and grading.

**Tethered Capture One:** Connect camera/back via USB or ethernet; Live View for composition; capture directly into a Capture One session. Adjust exposure and focus on screen. See capture-one-pro for tethered details.

**File handling and sessions:** Sessions keep everything in one place (captures, selects, output). Backup originals; use variants for different grades or crops. Export for delivery (TIFF, JPEG, PSD) with sharpening and metadata.

## Fuji camera (slow shutter)

**Intentional long exposure:** Motion blur (water, clouds, crowds) or stillness (night, low light). ND filters to extend shutter time in daylight; tripod and cable release (or remote) to avoid shake.

**ND filters, tripod, cable release:** Strong ND (e.g. 6–10 stop) for multi-second exposures in sun. Sturdy tripod; mirror lock-up if applicable; cable release or 2 s timer to eliminate shake.

**Motion blur and stillness:** Slow shutter smooths water and clouds; static elements stay sharp. Experiment with 1–30 s depending on effect. File format: raw for maximum latitude; process in Capture One.

## Capture One Pro for this workflow

**Sessions and catalogs:** Sessions = one folder per job, portable. Catalogs = one database, many folders. For Hasselblad/Fuji workflow, sessions are often preferred (easy to move, backup, and hand off).

**Hasselblad/Fuji camera profiles:** Capture One has camera-specific profiles and curves. Use the right profile for the back or Fuji model; adjust base curve and exposure in the tool.

**Color grading:** Curves (RGB and Luma), Levels, Color Balance, LCC (Lens Cast Correction) for tethering. Styles and presets for consistent look. Local adjustments (layers, masks) for fine control. See capture-one-pro for full tool depth.

**Round-trip and export:** Edit in Capture One; export TIFF/PSD for retouch in another app if needed; re-import or deliver final files. Sharpening and output resolution at export.

## When to use WEB_SEARCH

New firmware, new Capture One versions, specific Hasselblad back compatibility, or Fuji model quirks—use WEB_SEARCH and say when you looked it up.
