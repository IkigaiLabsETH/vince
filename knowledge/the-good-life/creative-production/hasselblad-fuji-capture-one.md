# Hasselblad, Fuji, Capture One Pro — Photography Workflow

The user's photography setup: Hasselblad H2 (film), Hasselblad 555 ELD (digital back coming), Fuji (slow shutter/creative), color grading in Capture One Pro. Practical, workflow-focused.

## Hasselblad H2 (Medium Format Film)

### The camera
- **Format:** 6×4.5 (645) — the H system is 645, not 6×6 (that's the V system). Rectangular frame, portrait-friendly.
- **Finder:** Eye-level prism or waist-level. The prism is practical for handheld; waist-level for deliberate, slow work on a tripod.
- **Film:** 120 roll film. ~16 frames per roll (645 format). Stock choices:
  - **Color negative:** Kodak Portra 160/400 (skin tones, latitude), Kodak Ektar 100 (saturated, landscape).
  - **Black & white:** Ilford HP5+ (versatile, 400 ISO), Kodak Tri-X 400 (classic grain), Ilford Delta 100 (fine grain).
  - **Slide (E-6):** Fuji Provia 100F (precise color), Fuji Velvia 50 (hyper-saturated, landscape — stunning but unforgiving).
- **Lens system:** HC lenses — sharp, contrasty, autofocus. The HC 80mm f/2.8 is the standard (equivalent ~50mm in 35mm terms).

### Shooting with the H2
- **Meter for shadows** (negative film) to preserve detail in darks. Negative film has excellent highlight latitude.
- **Meter for highlights** (slide film) — slide has almost no highlight recovery. Bracket ±1 stop when uncertain.
- **Reciprocity failure:** On exposures longer than ~1 second, film needs more time than the meter says. Correction varies by stock — Portra is forgiving, Velvia less so. Check data sheets or WEB_SEARCH for specific stocks.
- **The ritual:** Film forces discipline. 16 frames per roll means every frame costs money and thought. This is the point — it changes how you see.

### Film to digital
- **Lab scan:** Send to a pro lab for high-res drum or Imacon scans. This feeds directly into Capture One sessions as TIFF files.
- **Home scan:** Flatbed (Epson V850) or dedicated scanner (Plustek for 35mm, but for 645 you need medium-format capable). Quality ceiling is lower than lab scans.
- **Darkroom:** The analog path. Enlarger, chemicals, paper. For black & white — rewarding but time-intensive. The planned studio (85 sqm build) could accommodate this.

## Hasselblad 555 ELD + Digital Back

### The setup
- **Body:** 555 ELD — the motorized V-system body. Takes V-system lenses (Carl Zeiss — legendary glass: Planar 80mm f/2.8, Sonnar 150mm f/4, Distagon 50mm f/4).
- **Digital back:** When mounted, turns the 555 ELD into a digital medium format camera. Files are large, detailed, and grade beautifully in Capture One.
- **The appeal:** Zeiss V-system glass on a digital sensor. The rendering of these lenses — the way they handle light, bokeh, microcontrast — is different from modern lenses. Slower, more deliberate, but the results have character.

### Workflow (digital back in use)
- **Tethered to Capture One:** USB or WiFi (depending on back). Live View on screen for composition. Capture directly into a Capture One session. Adjust exposure, focus, and framing in real-time.
- **Session-based:** One folder per shoot. Captures, selects, output, trash — all in one portable folder. See capture-one-pro for session management.
- **File handling:** RAW files (IIQ or 3FR format depending on back). Process in Capture One with the camera-specific ICC profile for accurate color.

## Fuji (Slow Shutter / Creative)

### The approach
Fuji cameras (X-series or GFX) as the creative, experimental tool. The focus here is **intentional long exposure and slow shutter work** — motion blur, stillness, atmosphere.

### Long exposure technique
- **ND filters:** 6-stop (ND64) for moderate extensions; 10-stop (ND1000) for multi-second exposures in daylight. Screw-on or filter holder system.
- **Tripod:** Essential. Carbon fiber for travel, sturdy aluminum for studio. The tripod is the most important accessory for this work.
- **Cable release / remote:** Eliminates shake on long exposures. Or use the camera's 2-second timer.
- **Mirror lock-up (if applicable):** Reduces vibration from the mirror mechanism. On mirrorless Fuji X-series, this isn't needed.

### What to shoot
- **Water:** Rivers, ocean, waterfalls — 1–30 second exposures smooth the surface into silk or mist. The Atlantic coast and the lake at Hossegor are perfect subjects.
- **Clouds:** Moving clouds on a 15–30 second exposure create dramatic streaks across the sky. Works best with architectural or landscape anchors.
- **Night / low light:** City lights, car trails, the Milky Way on a clear night in the Landes (low light pollution inland).
- **Crowds:** Long exposure in a busy place makes people disappear or become ghosts. Interesting for architectural photography.

### Fuji film simulations
Fuji's built-in film simulations (Classic Chrome, Acros, Velvia, Pro Neg) are excellent for in-camera JPEGs. Classic Chrome is the most versatile — muted, documentary feel. But for serious work: shoot RAW and grade in Capture One.

## Capture One Pro (for this workflow)

See **capture-one-pro.md** for full tool depth. Key points for the Hasselblad/Fuji workflow:

- **Camera-specific profiles:** Capture One has ICC profiles for Hasselblad backs, Fuji X-series, and Fuji GFX. Select the right profile for accurate base color.
- **Sessions vs catalogs:** Sessions for this workflow — one folder per shoot, portable, easy to backup and archive.
- **Tethered capture:** Primary workflow for the 555 ELD digital back. Also works with Fuji GFX.
- **Color grading tools:** Curves (RGB and Luma), Color Balance (shadows/midtones/highlights), Levels, LCC (Lens Cast Correction for tethered shots). Styles and presets for consistent looks across a series.
- **Local adjustments:** Layers and masks for selective edits — dodge/burn, local color shifts, gradient filters.
- **Export:** TIFF/PSD for retouch, JPEG for web/delivery. Apply output sharpening at export.

## The creative vision

The Hasselblad H2 on film = deliberate, precious frames, the ritual of loading and waiting for results. The 555 ELD with digital back = Zeiss rendering meets digital workflow. The Fuji = experimental, creative, in-the-moment. All three converge in Capture One for grading and output.

The planned 85 sqm studio gives this workflow a proper home: controlled lighting for the Hasselblad, tethered station, print output. Until then: natural light, the Landes coast, the forest, and the house as subjects.

## When to use WEB_SEARCH

New firmware, Capture One version changes, specific Hasselblad back compatibility, Fuji model quirks, current film stock availability, or lab recommendations — use WEB_SEARCH and say when you looked it up.
