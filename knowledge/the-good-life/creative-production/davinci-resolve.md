> **📌 Knowledge Base Note**
> 
> This essay contains **historical examples and illustrative data** from when it was written.
> - **Numbers, prices, and metrics are OUTDATED** - they illustrate concepts, not current conditions
> - **Focus: Methodology and frameworks** - learn HOW TO THINK about topics, not what the numbers were
> - **Use for:** Analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic thinking
> - **Do NOT use for:** Current prices, up-to-date metrics, real-time data
> 
> **What this provides:** Thinking frameworks, methodologies, analytical approaches
> **What this does NOT provide:** Current market data (use actions/APIs instead)

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Import and organize footage
- Sync audio and video
- Clone and backup media
- Metadata management
- Fast-paced editing for tight deadlines

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs

### Color grading workflow for BMPCC 6K / BRAW
- **BRAW settings in Resolve:** Blackmagic RAW clips decode natively; use Camera Raw settings (exposure, white balance, ISO) in the Media or Color page. Preserve sensor data; adjust in Resolve rather than baking in-camera.
- **Color page workflow:** Primary corrections first (Lift, Gamma, Gain; contrast, saturation); then secondary (qualifiers, Power Windows) for skin, sky, or specific areas. Node system: serial nodes for stages; parallel or layer nodes when needed. See Color Page and Color Grading Mastery above for full tool set.
- **Round-trip:** Edit on a proxy or optimized media if needed; conform to BRAW for final grade. Deliver from the Color page or Deliver page (ProRes, DNxHR, or H.264/H.265 for delivery). See blackmagic-design for BMPCC 6K and IRIX lens context.
