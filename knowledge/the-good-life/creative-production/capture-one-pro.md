# Capture One Pro — Photo Editing & Tethered Shooting

The user's photo editing software for the Hasselblad (H2 film scans + 555 ELD digital back) and Fuji workflow. Professional raw processing, color grading, and tethered capture.

---

## Why Capture One (over Lightroom)

- **Color science:** Industry-leading. Camera-specific ICC profiles for Hasselblad, Fuji, and every major brand. Skin tones are noticeably better — richer, more accurate, less work to get right.
- **Tethered shooting:** The standard for studio work. Real-time preview, Live View for composition, instant adjustments during the shoot. Essential for the Hasselblad 555 ELD digital back.
- **Raw processing:** Superior detail extraction, highlight/shadow recovery, noise reduction. Gets more out of a raw file than any competitor.
- **Local adjustments:** Layers system with brushes, gradients, radial masks, luminosity masks, color range masks. Non-destructive. More powerful than Lightroom's masking.
- **Sessions:** Self-contained project folders. Ideal for shoot-based workflows — easy to backup, transfer, archive.

## Workflow: Sessions vs Catalogs

### Sessions (preferred for this workflow)

- One folder per shoot. Contains: captures, selects, output, trash.
- Portable — move the folder, everything comes with it.
- Ideal for assignment/project work: "2026-02-15 Hasselblad Studio Test."
- Easy backup: copy the session folder to external drive. Done.

### Catalogs

- Single database, many folders. Better for large, permanent photo libraries.
- Cross-project organization, smart albums, keyword search.
- Use for: the long-term archive of all photography work.

**Recommendation:** Work in sessions for each shoot; periodically import selects into a master catalog for the archive.

## Tethered shooting (the 555 ELD workflow)

1. **Connect:** USB or WiFi from the Hasselblad 555 ELD digital back to the computer.
2. **Live View:** See the scene in real-time on the computer screen. Adjust composition, focus, and exposure before capturing.
3. **Capture:** Trigger from Push 3 the camera or from Capture One. Files land directly in the session folder.
4. **Instant review:** Full-size preview appears immediately. Adjust exposure, white balance, crop on screen. Client or collaborator can see the results live.
5. **LCC (Lens Cast Correction):** Shoot a blank LCC frame (diffuser over lens) to correct for color cast and vignetting from the specific lens/back combination. Apply to all subsequent captures. Important for digital backs.

## Color grading tools (the core)

### Color Balance (3-way)

- **Shadows / Midtones / Highlights** — independent color wheels. The primary grading tool.
- Adjust hue and saturation in each tonal range. This is where you create a look.
- Example: warm midtones (golden skin) + cool shadows (blue-tinted depth) = cinematic portrait.

### Color Editor

- **Advanced tab:** Select any color range (by hue, saturation, lightness) and adjust independently.
- Target a specific color — shift a sky blue, correct a skin cast, adjust green foliage — without affecting anything else.
- Local and global modes.

### Curves

- **RGB curves:** Overall contrast and exposure. S-curve for punch.
- **Luma curve:** Adjusts luminance without affecting saturation. Better for contrast adjustments than RGB curves when you want to preserve color.
- **Per-channel (R, G, B):** Precise color shifts. Add blue to shadows, warmth to highlights.

### Levels

- Input and output levels per channel. Quick white/black point adjustments.

### Styles and presets

- Save any combination of adjustments as a style. Apply to future images with one click.
- Stack multiple styles. Build a personal library of looks.
- Share styles across sessions and catalogs.

## Local adjustments (layers)

- **Layers:** Up to 16+ layers per image, each with independent adjustments.
- **Brush mask:** Paint adjustments onto specific areas (dodge, burn, local color).
- **Gradient mask:** Linear or radial gradients for sky, foreground, vignettes.
- **Luminosity mask:** Target adjustments by brightness range — darks, midtones, highlights.
- **Color range mask:** Select a color range to mask — adjust only blue sky, only skin, only red elements.
- **Refine edge:** Feather and refine masks for natural blending.

## For the Hasselblad / Fuji workflow

### Hasselblad 555 ELD (digital back)

- Select the correct ICC camera profile for the back. Capture One has specific profiles for Hasselblad backs — they're better than generic profiles.
- Tethered workflow (see above).
- Files: IIQ or 3FR format (depending on back model). Full raw latitude.

### Hasselblad H2 (film scans)

- Import lab scans (TIFF) or home scans into a session.
- Grade as you would a raw file — curves, color balance, local adjustments all work on TIFFs.
- Not the same latitude as raw, but Capture One's tools still outperform other editors on TIFF.

### Fuji (slow shutter / creative)

- Camera-specific Fuji profiles and film simulation matches.
- Import raw files; grade for the long-exposure look — cooler shadows, slightly muted highlights for water/cloud blur.
- Capture One's noise reduction handles high-ISO Fuji files well.

---

## Export and output

- **Export recipes:** Batch process to multiple formats/sizes simultaneously (TIFF for archive, JPEG for web, PSD for retouch).
- **Sharpening at export:** Apply output-specific sharpening (screen vs print) in the recipe.
- **Soft proofing:** Preview how the image will look in a specific color space (sRGB for web, Adobe RGB for print).
- **Print:** Built-in print module for precise output. ICC profiles for paper/printer combinations.

## Learning priorities

1. **Master Color Balance and Curves.** These two tools handle 80% of grading. Learn to see warm/cool, and to shape light with the Luma curve.
2. **Understand sessions.** Set up a clean session template. Use it every shoot.
3. **Learn tethered capture.** The 555 ELD workflow depends on it.
4. **Build a style library.** Save your best looks. Apply consistently.
5. **Local adjustments.** Brush dodge/burn; gradient sky; luminosity masks for highlight control.
6. **Keyboard shortcuts.** Customize for speed. B for brush, E for eraser, D for next image, A for select — build muscle memory.

## When to use WEB_SEARCH

New Capture One versions (features change), Hasselblad back compatibility, Fuji support updates, specific style packs, or printing ICC profiles — use WEB_SEARCH and say when you looked it up.
