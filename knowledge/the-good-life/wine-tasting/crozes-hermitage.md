E. Guigal Crozes-Hermitage RougeOverview

E. Guigal Crozes-Hermitage Rouge is a 100% Syrah red wine from the Crozes-Hermitage AOC, the largest appellation in France's Northern Rhône Valley. Guigal produces a more serious, structured, and intense version than typical entry-level Crozes-Hermitage wines, emphasizing hillside fruit for depth, vigor, and exceptional value. The estate began making this wine in 1999 after acquiring low-yielding, old-vine hillside parcels in the appellation's northern sector. Annual production averages about 450,000 bottles, with strong aging potential (up to 10 years)

Producer Background

Established in 1946 by Étienne Guigal in Ampuis, the family-run E. Guigal estate is one of the most respected in the Rhône Valley. Marcel and Philippe Guigal now lead it, focusing on meticulous vineyard selection, long aging, and quality across appellations like Côte-Rôtie, Hermitage, and Saint-Joseph. Their Crozes-Hermitage reflects the family's philosophy: elevating accessible appellations to deliver complexity far beyond their price point.Vineyards and TerroirLocations: Steep hillside slopes primarily in Gervans, Mercurol, Larnage, and Crozes-Hermitage villages (northern part of the appellation for better exposure and drainage).

Average vine age: 35 years.
Soils: Limestone, clay-silt, sandy gravel; warm pebbly alluvial soils with excellent drainage.
Yield: Approximately 40 hl/ha (relatively low for concentration).

WinemakingGrape variety: 100% Syrah.

Fermentation: In stainless steel tanks at high temperatures, with 3 weeks maceration.
Aging: 18 months in 228L oak barrels (produced in-house at Château d'Ampuis cooperage; mix of larger foudres and barriques for refined integration).

Approach: Focuses on purity of fruit, structure, and freshness rather than over-extraction.

Tasting Profile (General Across Vintages)

Appearance: Dark ruby red with deep color.
Nose: Fresh red fruits (cherry, strawberry, red currant), black fruits (blackcurrant, blackberry, cassis), smoke, plum, black pepper, delicate oak, violet, and spice.
Palate: Medium to full-bodied, structured with refined, supple tannins; good acidity for freshness. Flavors include blackcurrant buds, vanilla, sweet spices, herbs (tarragon), singed cedar, and subtle earthy/animal notes (salumi, game).
Finish: Long, balanced, with zesty fruit-tannin interplay.
Style: Elegant yet powerful Northern Rhône Syrah—approachable young but rewards cellaring. Often described as "generous and alluring" with remarkable freshness.

Recent Vintages and Reviews (as of early 2026)

2020: Rich, dense, and appealing; notes of smoke, plums, spice, red currant, cassis, cured meats, and iron minerality. Ratings: 92 Wine Spectator, 91 James Suckling, 90 Jeb Dunnuck.
2021: Lighter, juicier style with rustic charm; red cherries, currants, cedar, fine herbs, violet. Ratings: 92 James Suckling ("prototypical Crozes... juicy briar character"), positive Wine Enthusiast notes on classic expression.
2022/2023: Emerging; early indications suggest balanced, fresh profiles similar to 2021, but limited reviews available yet.

Food Pairings

Ideal with red meats, game (venison, duck), charcuterie, roasted dishes, and hard cheeses. The peppery spice and structure complement herb-rubbed grilled meats or earthy stews.

Additional Notes

This wine serves as an excellent introduction to Northern Rhône Syrah while punching above its weight class due to Guigal's rigorous standards.
