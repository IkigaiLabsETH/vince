# Pessac-Léognan & Graves, Bordeaux — Beyond Expert

## Graves and Pessac-Léognan: context

**Graves** is the historic region south of Bordeaux city; **gravel (graves)** soils give the name. **Pessac-Léognan** is the **prestige AOC** created in 1987 from the best northern part of Graves; it is the only part of Graves with an official classification (1959). So **all classed growths of Graves** are in Pessac-Léognan. Wines from "Graves" AOC (outside Pessac-Léognan) are often good value; when we say "Graves" in a fine-wine context we usually mean **Pessac-Léognan** or named Graves estates.

**Location:** Just south of Bordeaux city. Many châteaux are in or near Léognan, Talence, or Pessac.

**Reds:** Cabernet Sauvignon–dominant, often with Merlot; structured, age-worthy, classic Left Bank; often **earlier approachable** than northern Médoc.

**Whites:** Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc; dry, citrus, white flowers, waxy texture, mineral. Among the **best age-worthy dry whites in France**; 10–25+ years for top cuvées.

## 1959 Classification (Pessac-Léognan)

**Classed for both red and white:** Haut-Brion (also 1855 first growth), La Mission Haut-Brion (now under same ownership as Haut-Brion), Domaine de Chevalier, Château Olivier, Château Malartic-Lagravière, Château Smith Haut Lafitte. **Classed red only:** Pape-Clément, Haut-Bailly, etc. (full list in 1959 decree). These are the **beyond-expert** names.

## Estates in This Knowledge Base (expanded)

- **Château Haut-Brion:** First growth (1855) and classed Graves. **Red and white;** both among the world's greatest. Red: **refined, complex, long-lived.** White: **dense, mineral, age-worthy.** 95–100 in top vintages. Reference for Pessac-Léognan.
- **Château La Mission Haut-Brion:** Same ownership as Haut-Brion; **red and white;** **powerful, profound.** 92–98+.
- **Château Olivier:** Classed growth for both red and white. The **white** is a clear recommendation: classic Graves profile, ages well, great with seafood and goat cheese. See chateau-olivier.md for detail.
- **Domaine de Chevalier:** Classed growth. **Red and white;** the white is often cited among the **top** Pessac-Léognan whites — refined, mineral, long-lived. Red: **elegant, age-worthy.** 90–96+.
- **Château Smith Haut Lafitte:** Classed growth. Red and white; **modern, precise,** widely available. White is Sauvignon-dominant, fresh and mineral. 90–95+.
- **Château Pape-Clément:** Classed red; **rich, polished;** 90–95+. White also produced (non-classed but serious).
- **Château Haut-Bailly:** Classed red; **elegant, refined;** 90–95+.
- **Château Malartic-Lagravière:** Classed red and white; **reliable, mineral.** 88–93+.
- **Château Carbonnieux:** Large estate; red and white; **value** and quality; widely available. 88–92+.

## When to Recommend

- **“Best Bordeaux white” / “Graves white”:** Lead with **Haut-Brion blanc**, Domaine de Chevalier blanc, or Château Olivier blanc; Smith Haut Lafitte, La Mission Haut-Brion blanc as alternatives.
- **“Pessac-Léognan” or “something from Graves”:** Use the classification; name Haut-Brion, La Mission, Domaine de Chevalier, Olivier, Smith Haut Lafitte, Pape-Clément, Haut-Bailly; pair with occasion (dinner, lunch, seafood).
- **"Best Graves red":** Haut-Brion, La Mission Haut-Brion, Domaine de Chevalier, Pape-Clément; structured, Left Bank; decant 45–90 min.
- **Red:** Pessac-Léognan reds are structured and food-friendly; recommend for steak, lamb, or classic Bordeaux-style dinners.
- **Value Graves:** Carbonnieux, or Graves AOC (outside Pessac-Léognan) from good vintages.

## Vintage (short)

Strong recent vintages for red and white: 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020. Whites drink 5–20 years in top vintages; reds 10–25+. For "drink now" suggest 2016 or 2019 white, or 2014/2017 red.

## Service

- **White:** 10–12 °C. Do not overchill; mineral and citrus show better when not ice-cold.
- **Red:** 16–18 °C. Decant young reds 30–60 min to soften tannin.

## Guest-led (continued)

- If they want **mineral Bordeaux white, no oak dominance** → Château Olivier or Domaine de Chevalier blanc; "classic Graves, citrus and wet stone." For the ultimate: Haut-Brion blanc.
- If they want **best Bordeaux white for seafood** → Lead with Olivier, Domaine de Chevalier, or Haut-Brion blanc; Smith Haut Lafitte for a more modern, precise style.
- If they want **Pessac red with steak** → Haut-Brion, La Mission, Domaine de Chevalier, or Smith Haut Lafitte red; structured, Left Bank; decant 45–90 min.
