## Overview

**Margaux** is a **Haut-Médoc** communal appellation; **Cabernet Sauvignon–dominant** with Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot. Soils: **gravel (Pyrenean)** over clay-limestone; the appellation is **fragmented** (many small croupes).

## Terroir

- **Gravel croupes** separated by streams and meadows; **elevation** and **drainage** vary; best sites have deep gravel and good exposure. **Chantelune** (see essay below) is an example of a tiny perfect parcel that was never classified.

We opened the Château Prieuré-Lichine 2020, because it was already in the rack and the steak was resting. The cork slid out with that satisfying sigh only a well-cellared Bordeaux gives. One swirl and the room filled with black cherries, warm graphite, and the faintest whiff of the herb garden after rain. On the palate it was everything a modern classified-growth Margaux has learned to be: plush yet precise, medium-full, with tannins like cashmere and a bright, mouth-watering finish that made the next sip involuntary. James Suckling’s 96 points felt conservative. And yet, as often happens when a great wine loosens the tongue, the conversation drifted to the one Margaux we keep talking about even when we’re drinking something else.

There is a hill in Margaux that almost no one talks about. It rises modestly above the hamlet of Soussans, crowned by a single plot of forty-year-old vines and a low stone wall that looks older than the appellation itself. From the top you can see the spires of Château Margaux in the distance and, on a clear day, the silver ribbon of the Gironde estuary beyond.

On that ridge, José Sanfins makes one of the most compelling red wines in Bordeaux today. He calls it Château Chantelune. The rest of the world is only now catching on.

Most people who meet José Sanfins first know him as the technical director of Third Growth Château Cantenac Brown, a 1855-classified estate with 72 hectares, a brand-new eco-designed winery, and the kind of visibility that comes with two centuries of pedigree.

What fewer realize is that every evening, after tasting through barrel samples at Cantenac Brown, Sanfins drives five minutes down a gravel lane to a 1.2 hectares that belong to him alone. There he does everything by hand: pruning, leaf-thinning, harvesting, sorting.

He makes 400 to 540 cases a year—barely enough to fill a single shipping container—and yet, vintage after vintage, Chantelune quietly racks up scores in the mid-90s, outshining many classified growths that cost five or ten times as much.

The story of Chantelune is the story of what happens when one of the Médoc’s most meticulous winemakers is given total freedom on a perfect speck of dirt.

The Man Who Works for the Moon

José Sanfins is Portuguese by birth, Bordelais by conviction. He arrived in Margaux in the late 1980s, took the reins at Cantenac Brown in 1997, and has spent the last quarter-century turning a respectable but sleepy estate into one of the most dynamic properties on the Left Bank.

Along the way he bought this tiny parcel in 2004 from a retired carpenter named Mr. Soubrane, who had planted the vines in the early 1980s and harvested by the light of the moon—hence the name Chantelune, “sing to the moon.”

Sanfins could have folded the plot into Cantenac Brown. Instead he kept it separate, a laboratory for ideas he could not always apply on a larger scale. Where Cantenac Brown is polished and corporate in the best sense, Chantelune is raw, obsessive, almost monastic.

There is no château, no tasting room, no website, no Instagram account. There is only the hill, the vines, and a man who refuses to compromise.

A Terroir That Should Not Exist

The Margaux appellation is famously fragmented, a patchwork of gravel croupes separated by streams and meadows. Most of the best sites were identified and classified in 1855. Somehow this one was missed. The soil here is classic Pyrenean gravel over a clay-limestone base, but the mound’s elevation—about 25 meters above sea level—gives it slightly cooler nights and better drainage than many neighboring parcels. The vines face due south, basking in sun while the clay lenses below retain just enough moisture to carry them through drought. In short, it is textbook Margaux terroir, only more so.

Sanfins farms it as if the vines were his children. Yields hover between 25 and 35 hectoliters per hectare—half of what the appellation allows. Every cluster is harvested by hand twice: once for green harvest, once at perfect ripeness. The grapes are destemmed berry by berry in the vineyard, loaded into small baskets, and driven to Cantenac Brown’s winery in the trunk of Sanfins’s own car. There is no pump-over system small enough, so he punches down by hand, sometimes at 3 a.m. if that is when the cap needs attention.

The Wine Itself

Chantelune is almost always 60–70 % Cabernet Sauvignon, the rest Merlot with a seasoning of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It is aged in 50–70 % new French oak for 16–18 months, yet the wood never dominates. What emerges is a Margaux of unusual density and precision: inky purple in the glass, with aromas of cassis, violet, graphite, and warm stone. On the palate it is paradoxically both powerful and weightless—silky tannins, vivid acidity, and a finish that lingers like a violin note.

Critics have run out of superlatives. The 2015 earned a gold medal and 95 points; the 2016 received a rare Coup de Cœur in the Guide Hachette; the 2020 was called “a “jewel” by Decanter at 94 points. Even in the challenging 2013 vintage the wine was described as “classy” and “precise.” These are not flukes. They are the result of a man who treats one hectare as if it were Lafite.

Why It Matters Now

In an era when Bordeaux is increasingly dominated by corporations, consultants, and climate anxiety, Chantelune is a defiant reminder of what the region can still be. It is a wine made not for investors or auction houses but for people who believe that pleasure and profundity can coexist in the same bottle. At €29 retail (when you can find it), it is one of the greatest values in fine wine today—cheaper than most cru bourgeois, half the price of many unclassified “super seconds,” and frankly better than many classified growths.

Yet its very existence feels precarious. Sanfins is in his sixties. There is no second generation waiting in the wings. When he is gone, will the parcel be absorbed into a larger estate? Will the vines be uprooted for a housing development? Or will someone else recognize that this moonlit hill is irreplaceable?

For now, the wine is still here, still singing. Open a bottle of the 2021 tonight and you will taste blackcurrant and crushed stone. If you have never tried Château Chantelune, do not wait for it to become famous. By then it will be too late. Some revolutions are loud. This one is only 1.2 hectares wide, and it whispers.

Raise a glass to the moon. She has been listening all along.
