# Building Your Wine Cellar — Advice from Hugues Forget (La Grande Épicerie)

Source: The Good Life interview with Hugues Forget, chef de cave and head of wine purchasing at La Grande Épicerie de Paris.

## The One Rule
**Buy what you love.** You're building this for yourself first. A bottle you share is better when you can tell its story.

## Key Principles
1. **Match to your moments.** Apéro wine ≠ Sunday family lunch wine ≠ special occasion. Stock for all three.
2. **Don't buy a price.** Expensive ≠ good. There's no guaranteed correlation between cost and quality.
3. **Avoid the algorithm trap.** Social media pushes the same trendy wines. Cellar-building should be about discovery.
4. **Note what you drink.** Photo the label. Write one line. This builds your palate profile and sharpens future picks.
5. **Buy by the case (6).** When you find something you love, buy six. Return to it. That's how you train your palate.
6. **Renew your best references.** The biggest amateur mistake: forgetting to re-buy the wines they loved most.

## Three Profiles

### The Beginner (Le Néophyte)
**Goal:** Build a palate with accessible, well-made wines at fair prices.

**Whites to explore:**
- Loire chenins and sauvignons (Vouvray, Sancerre)
- Muscadet crus (in full renaissance — great value)
- Quality Crémant de Loire (€9-15 — genuine bubble joy without Champagne price)

**Reds to explore:**
- Southern France cuvées (structure, warmth) vs. Northern Pinot Noir (lighter, aromatic)
- Alsace Pinot Noir — in net progress, much cheaper than Burgundy
- Young Bordeaux vignerons breaking with uniform style — gourmand wines at fair price

**Coup de coeur:** Domaine des Pierrettes, Ciel de Perles, Crémant de Loire (€9.50). Pure chenin, dry, aromatic, dynamic. All the pleasure of bubbles without the ceremony.

**Armoire:** Service armoire (keeps at drinking temp, not for aging). Mono-temperature preferred. €200-500. Brands: Cavist, Klarstein, Haier.

### The Amateur (L'Amateur)
**Goal:** Refine taste, explore secondary labels of great estates, balance garde vs. ready-to-drink.

**What to stock:**
- Beaujolais crus, Côtes-du-Rhône from real vignerons, underrated Mediterranean whites
- Loire signatures: Thierry Germain (Saumur), François Chidaine (Vouvray/Montlouis)
- Burgundy on a budget: Mâconnais, Hautes-Côtes-de-Beaune, Hautes-Côtes-de-Nuits — top vignerons are now planting there (climate change helping)
- Secondary labels from famous estates (see bordeaux-seconds-vins.md)

**Coup de coeur:** Domaine Jean Féry, La Combe des Amoureuses 2023, Hautes-Côtes-de-Beaune (€29). Chardonnay, only 5,400 bottles. Competes with Côte de Beaune village wines at half the price.

**Armoire:** Polyvalent (service + aging), 100+ bottles. 5-18°C range. €500-1,500. Brands: La Sommelière, Climadiff, Liebherr. Some now connected with digital cellar book.

**Mix:** Balance reds/whites, garde/ready, plus effervescents and a small share of liquoreux (Sauternes).

### The Connoisseur (Le Connaisseur)
**Goal:** Rare wines, terroir-driven, long garde. Not about price — about finding what's hard to get.

**Profile per Hugues Forget:** "I see more and more young connoisseurs. Pointus people who, without much money, will go unreasonable on one bottle they absolutely want." They prefer Margaux or Saint-Émilion du plateau over generic "Bordeaux." They know their Burgundy climats. They're into Jura (hot right now). They hunt Domaine des Tours (accessible cousin of Château Rayas — but still hard to find).

**What to stock:**
- Bordeaux classified growths (primeurs prices dropping — Saint-Émilion more attractive than Médoc right now)
- Burgundy: village wines from star vignerons (the affordable entry point to greatness)
- Rhône: Guigal, Chapoutier, Jaboulet top cuvées when Chave and Rayas are unfindable
- Champagne: serious vins de garde (vintage Champagne, grower cuvées)
- International: German Riesling (Moselle Spätlese), Italian Barolo (Piémont)

**Coup de coeur:** Penfolds Grange Bin 95 2021 (€700). The quintessential Australian Shiraz — complex, powerful, needs 10+ years. A connoisseur will forget it for decades.

**Armoire:** Vieillissement (aging-only), replicate natural cave conditions (controlled hygrometry). Go big capacity from the start. Anti-UV treated glass door. €1,500-3,000. Brands: Miele, EuroCave, Artevino.

## Kelly's Cellar-Building Quick Advice
- **Just starting?** Crémant de Loire + a case of something you loved last week. Done.
- **Got 50 bottles?** Split: 40% ready-to-drink, 40% aging (3-10 years), 20% long garde or special occasion.
- **Got 200+ bottles?** You need a vieillissement armoire (EuroCave minimum). Track everything. Renew your favorites religiously.
- **Near Bordeaux?** Hit primeurs tastings in spring. Saint-Émilion offers better value than Médoc right now.
- **Budget move:** Hautes-Côtes-de-Beaune whites and Muscadet crus. Seriously underpriced for the quality.
