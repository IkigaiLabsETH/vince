## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate wine evaluation and tasting through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to wine evaluation and tasting
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated

# Rhône Valley, France

## Overview

Two distinct parts. **Northern Rhône:** Syrah (red), Viognier (white); steep slopes; Hermitage, Côte-Rôtie, Crozes-Hermitage, Saint-Joseph, Condrieu. **Southern Rhône:** Grenache-led blends, often with Syrah, Mourvèdre; Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Gigondas, Vacqueyras, Lirac. Warmer, fuller, more fruit-forward.

## Northern Rhône

- **Hermitage:** Syrah; powerful, age-worthy, spice and dark fruit. Among the finest reds of France. **Guigal, Chapoutier, Jean-Louis Chave** are benchmark producers. Pair with lamb, game, strong cheese.
- **Côte-Rôtie:** Syrah (can include a little Viognier); silkier than Hermitage, floral and red fruit. **Guigal** (including La Mouline, La Landonne, La Turque) is legendary. Romantic dinner, lamb, duck.
- **Crozes-Hermitage:** See crozes-hermitage.md. Syrah; best value in Northern Rhône; **Guigal** outstanding. Everyday red, grilled meat.
- **Saint-Joseph:** Syrah; slightly lighter than Hermitage; red fruit, pepper. Good with lamb, charcuterie.
- **Condrieu:** Viognier (white). Floral, stone fruit, rich but dry. Pair with lobster, scallops, Asian-inspired dishes. Small production; premium.

**When to recommend:** "Serious red," "something like Bordeaux but different," steak, lamb, game. Northern Rhône = structure and spice; lead with Hermitage or Côte-Rôtie for splurge, Crozes-Hermitage for value.

## Southern Rhône

- **Châteauneuf-du-Pape:** Grenache-led (up to 13 varieties allowed); full-bodied, ripe fruit, spice, garrigue. Can be powerful and age-worthy. **Château de Beaucastel, Clos des Papes, Vieux Télégraphe** are reference estates. Pair with lamb, daube, grilled meat, strong cheese.
- **Gigondas:** Similar profile to Châteauneuf; often slightly more rustic and value-friendly. Great with braised meat, stews.
- **Vacqueyras:** Neighbor to Gigondas; robust, fruity; good value.
- **Lirac, Tavel:** Tavel = rosé (dry, structured). Lirac = red, white, rosé; good everyday options.

**When to recommend:** "Big red," barbecue, lamb, stews, "Rhône blend." Southern Rhône = warmth and fruit; Châteauneuf for the top end, Gigondas/Vacqueyras for value.

## Summary

- **Northern Rhône:** Syrah; Hermitage, Côte-Rôtie (splurge), Crozes-Hermitage (value). White: Condrieu (Viognier).
- **Southern Rhône:** Grenache-led; Châteauneuf-du-Pape (flagship), Gigondas, Vacqueyras.

## Vintage (short)

Northern Rhône: 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020 are strong; Hermitage and Côte-Rôtie can age 10–25+ years. Crozes drink sooner (5–12 years). Southern Rhône: 2016, 2019, 2020; Châteauneuf 10–20 years in top vintages; Gigondas/Vacqueyras often drink 5–12 years.

## Service

- **Red:** 16–18 °C. Decant young Hermitage, Côte-Rôtie, Châteauneuf 30–60 min to soften tannin and open aroma. Older bottles: decant briefly or not at all.
- **Condrieu (white):** 10–12 °C; serve soon after opening to keep aromatics.

## Guest-led

- If they want **value in Northern Rhône** → Crozes-Hermitage (Guigal); if they want **to impress** → Hermitage (Chave, Guigal) or Côte-Rôtie (Guigal La La's).
- If they want **big red, barbecue or lamb** → Châteauneuf-du-Pape (Beaucastel, Clos des Papes) or Gigondas for value.
- If they want **aromatic white, not Chardonnay** → Condrieu (Cuilleron, Villard); pair with lobster or scallops.
