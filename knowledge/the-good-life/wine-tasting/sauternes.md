# Sauternes & Barsac, Bordeaux, France

## Overview

Sweet white wines from **Sémillon** (dominant), **Sauvignon Blanc**, and **Muscadelle**. Botrytis ("noble rot") concentrates the grapes; result is luscious, honeyed, apricot and orange, with acidity that keeps it from being cloying. Among the world's greatest dessert wines.

## Appellations

- **Sauternes:** The main appellation; includes the famous **Château d'Yquem** (premier cru supérieur, the top classification). **Château Climens, Château Rieussec, Château Suduiraut, Château Guiraud** are other top estates.
- **Barsac:** Can be labeled Barsac or Sauternes. Slightly lighter and more refined in some vintages; **Château Climens** (Barsac) is a reference.

## Style and aging

- **Profile:** Honey, apricot, peach, orange marmalade, botrytis (noble rot); sweet but balanced by acidity. Can age decades; Yquem and top Sauternes improve for 20–50+ years.
- **When to drink:** Young = primary fruit; aged = more caramel, dried fruit, complexity. Serve chilled; small pours (50–75 ml) are enough.

## Food pairings

- **Classic:** Foie gras (the classic match), blue cheese (Roquefort, Stilton), fruit-based desserts (tarte Tatin, peach, apricot).
- **Alternative:** Spicy-sweet Asian dishes, strong cheeses, or as dessert on its own.

## When to recommend

- **Dessert wine,** **sweet wine,** **foie gras,** **blue cheese,** **something special to end the meal,** **anniversary or celebration dessert.** Lead with Sauternes (or Barsac); name **Château d'Yquem** for the ultimate, or **Climens, Rieussec, Suduiraut** for other top options.

## Vintage (short)

Top vintages: 2001, 2009, 2015, 2016; 2019, 2020 very good. Yquem and top Sauternes age 20–50+ years. For "drink now" suggest 2009 or 2015; for "something special to cellar" suggest 2016 or 2020.

## Service

- **Temperature:** 8–10 °C. Serve in small pours (50–75 ml); sweetness is intense.
- **Glass:** Smaller white or dessert glass; tulip shape concentrates aroma.
