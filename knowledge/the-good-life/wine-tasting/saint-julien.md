# Saint-Julien, Médoc, Bordeaux — Beyond Expert

## Overview

**Saint-Julien** is the **smallest** of the four major Haut-Médoc communal appellations (with Margaux, Pauillac, Saint-Estèphe) but has a **very high proportion of classed growths**. No first growths here, but **eleven classed growths** including famous seconds and thirds. Style: **balanced, refined, classic Left Bank** — often described as the most "consistent" and approachable of the four; **elegance and structure** without the raw power of Pauillac or the firmness of Saint-Estèphe.

## Terroir

- **Graves (gravel)** along the Gironde; similar to Pauillac but with a **slightly more homogeneous** terroir across the appellation. Good drainage; Cabernet Sauvignon–dominant blends.

## Key châteaux (1855 classification)

- **Château Léoville Las Cases:** **Structured, serious, long-lived;** often compared to first growth quality; 92–98+.

## Style and profile

- **Classic Saint-Julien:** Cassis, blackcurrant, cedar, tobacco; **balanced** acid and tannin; **refined** rather than brutal; 10–25+ years. Often **better value** than Pauillac first growths for "classic" Médoc.
