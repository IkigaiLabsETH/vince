# Japanese Whisky

On-brand with **IKIGAI STUDIO** and **IKIGAI LABS** — the Japanese philosophy of purpose runs through both the whisky and the company. Kelly knows this connection and can reference it naturally.

## Why Japanese Whisky

Japanese whisky is precision, patience, and craft — the same principles behind ikigai. Distillers studied in Scotland, then brought obsessive Japanese attention to detail. The result: whiskies that compete with and often surpass their Scottish counterparts.

## The Houses

### Suntory (est. 1923)
- **Yamazaki** — Japan's first and flagship. The 12-year is the gateway: dried fruit, gentle oak, hint of Mizunara (Japanese oak). The 18 and 25 are collector-tier.
- **Hakushu** — The "forest distillery." Lighter, herbaceous, green apple, fresh. The 12-year is excellent; think of it as Japan's answer to a Highland single malt with a green twist.
- **Hibiki** — Suntory's blended masterpiece. Harmony in a glass. The Harmony (NAS) is elegant and approachable; the 17 and 21 are world-class.
- **Chita** — Single grain, lighter and sweeter. Good in highballs.

### Nikka (est. 1934)
- **Yoichi** — Peaty, robust, maritime. Japan's Islay. Single Malt is excellent.
- **Miyagikyo** — Softer, fruity, elegant. Counterpoint to Yoichi.
- **From the Barrel** — Cask-strength blend, 51.4%. Punches way above its price. Best value in Japanese whisky.
- **Taketsuru Pure Malt** — Blend of Yoichi and Miyagikyo. Named after Nikka's founder Masataka Taketsuru, who trained at Scottish distilleries.
- **Coffey Grain / Coffey Malt** — Unusual column-still expressions, unique and interesting.

### Others Worth Knowing
- **Chichibu** (Ichiro's Malt) — Tiny craft distillery, Ichiro Akuto. The Card Series is legendary and near-impossible to find. New releases sell out instantly.
- **Mars Shinshu** — High-altitude distillery, interesting terroir plays.
- **Akkeshi** — Hokkaido, deliberately mirrors Islay climate. Peated, maritime.

## Service

- **Neat or with a few drops of water** — opens up the delicate aromatics
- **Mizuwari** (whisky + cold water, roughly 1:2-3) — the Japanese standard for dinner. Refreshing, food-friendly.
- **Highball** (whisky + sparkling water) — Suntory popularized this; Hakushu and Chita are ideal. Serve tall with lots of ice.
- **On the rocks** — with one large clear ice cube (Japanese style)

## Pairing with Kelly's World

- **The ikigai connection:** "Yamazaki" means "at the foot of the mountain" — there's a reason we named it IKIGAI. Same patience, same craft.
- **After dinner at home:** Yamazaki 12 or Hibiki Harmony, neat. After a Green Egg BBQ especially.
- **Gift:** Hibiki Harmony (beautiful bottle, universally loved) or Nikka From the Barrel (impressive for the price, cask-strength).
- **Collecting:** Yamazaki 18+, Hibiki 21, anything Chichibu/Ichiro's Malt.
