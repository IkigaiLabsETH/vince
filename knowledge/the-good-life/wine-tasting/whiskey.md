## When to recommend / guest-led

- **"After dinner" / "something not wine"** → Whiskey; ask if they prefer **peaty, smooth, or bourbon**; then route to Scotch (Ardbeg/Laphroaig for peaty, Macallan/Glenfiddich for smooth) or bourbon (Buffalo Trace, Four Roses) or Irish (Redbreast).
- **"Peaty" / "smoky"** → Islay Scotch: Ardbeg, Laphroaig, Lagavulin; "brine, smoke, long finish."
- **"Smooth" / "easy"** → Speyside (Glenfiddich, Glenlivet), Irish (Redbreast 12, Jameson), or bourbon (Buffalo Trace, Maker's Mark).
- **"Bourbon"** → Buffalo Trace, Four Roses, Woodford Reserve; for prestige tier suggest Pappy/allocated and note availability.
- **"Japanese whisky"** → Yamazaki, Hibiki, Nikka; "refined, balanced; check availability."
- **"Gift"** → Single malt (Macallan, Highland Park) or Japanese (Hibiki) or Redbreast 15; name one from knowledge; for current award winners use WEB_SEARCH.
