# Alsace, France

## Overview

White-wine region in the northeast; mostly **Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris**, plus Pinot Blanc, Sylvaner, Muscat. Wines are typically **dry** (except late-harvest and sélection de grains nobles), aromatic, and bottled in the tall flute bottle. **Grand cru** vineyards are classified.

## Key varieties and styles

- **Riesling:** Dry, floral, citrus, mineral; can age. Versatile with food: seafood, Asian, poultry, pork. **When to recommend:** "Dry Riesling," "aromatic white," Asian food, apéritif.
- **Gewurztraminer:** Lychee, rose, spice; full-bodied, aromatic. Pairs with Asian (Thai, Indian, Chinese), spicy food, strong cheese, foie gras. **When to recommend:** "Aromatic white," "something different," Asian or spicy dishes.
- **Pinot Gris:** Rich, smoky, stone fruit; can be opulent. Foie gras, poultry, smoked fish, creamy sauces. **When to recommend:** "Rich white," "not too light," autumn dishes.
- **Pinot Blanc / Sylvaner:** Lighter, easy-drinking; apéritif, salads, light lunch.
- **Crémant d'Alsace:** Sparkling; often good value; apéritif.

## Grand cru

Named vineyards (e.g. Schlossberg, Rangen, Hengst) indicate top sites. Use for "best Alsace" or when they want to spend more.

## When to recommend

- **Aromatic white,** **dry Riesling,** **Asian food,** **spicy food,** **apéritif with character,** **foie gras (Gewurz or Pinot Gris).** Lead with variety (Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris) and mention grand cru if they want a step up.

## Producers to know

- **Riesling:** Trimbach (dry, classic), Domaine Weinbach, Hugel, Zind-Humbrecht, Marcel Deiss (blend-focused). Grand cru: Trimbach Clos Sainte Hune, Weinbach Schlossberg.
- **Gewurztraminer:** Trimbach, Zind-Humbrecht, Domaine Weinbach, Hugel. Aromatic, lychee, rose.
- **Pinot Gris:** Trimbach, Zind-Humbrecht, Weinbach. Rich, smoky.
- **Crémant d'Alsace:** Lucien Albrecht, Dopff & Irion.

## Service

- **White:** 8–10 °C (Riesling, Gewurz, Pinot Gris). Do not overchill; aromatics need a bit of warmth.
- **Glass:** Tulip or white-wine glass to capture aroma.

## Guest-led

- If they want **aromatic white, Asian or spicy food** → Gewurztraminer (Trimbach, Zind-Humbrecht) or Riesling (Trimbach); "acidity and a touch of sweetness tame heat."
- If they want **dry, mineral, not oaky** → Alsace Riesling (Trimbach); grand cru for a step up.
- If they want **foie gras** → Pinot Gris or Gewurztraminer (Weinbach, Zind-Humbrecht); rich and aromatic match the liver.
