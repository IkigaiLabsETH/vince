# Saint-Estèphe, Médoc, Bordeaux — Beyond Expert

## Overview

**Saint-Estèphe** is the **northernmost** of the four major Haut-Médoc communal appellations. **More clay** in the soils than Pauillac and Saint-Julien; wines are often **firmer, more tannic in youth**, with **robust structure** and **good value** at the cru bourgeois and lower classed-growth level. Fewer classed growths than Saint-Julien or Pauillac but **Cos d'Estournel** and **Montrose** are among the best of the Médoc (second growths, often 95+).

## Terroir

- **Clay and gravel;** cooler, northern position; **later ripening**; tannins can be **grippy** when young. Best estates have gravel outcrops and good drainage; **Cos** and **Montrose** have exceptional terroir.
