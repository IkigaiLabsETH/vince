# Château Olivier (Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux)

## Overview

Château Olivier is one of the oldest estates in the Pessac-Léognan appellation, with origins tracing back to the **13th century**. The property sits on prime gravelly terroir in **Léognan**, surrounded by a moat and parkland that make it one of Bordeaux's most photogenic estates.

Owned by the **de Bethmann family**, Olivier is one of only six estates classified for **both red and white** in the 1959 Classification of Graves — a distinction that reflects the quality of its terroir across both colors. The estate has been on a steady upward trajectory since the early 2000s, with significant investment in winemaking and vineyard management.

**Classification:** Cru Classé de Graves (red and white)
**AOC:** Pessac-Léognan
**Key fact:** One of the few classified Bordeaux estates producing both red and white at a high level — and at prices that make no sense given the quality.

## Château Olivier Blanc (White)

This is the headline wine. If you only try one thing from Olivier, make it the white.

**Blend:** Sauvignon Blanc dominant (~55-65%), with Sémillon (~30-35%) and a touch of Muscadelle. Classic Graves white architecture.

**Profile:** Citrus (lemon, grapefruit), white flowers, subtle waxy texture from the Sémillon, and a mineral backbone that screams Pessac-Léognan terroir. Clean, focused, with a saline finish that makes you reach for oysters.

**Aging:** Drinks well from 3-5 years but rewards patience — ages comfortably 5-10 years in good vintages, with top years stretching to 15+. The Sémillon component adds richness and complexity over time.

**Scores:** Consistently 88-92 points from major critics. Not flashy, but dependable — you always know what you're getting.

**Food pairings:** Shellfish (especially oysters, langoustines), grilled fish, goat cheese, asparagus, light cream sauces. A strong choice for a refined lunch or as a standalone apéritif.

**Why it matters:** Classified Graves white Bordeaux for €25-35. That's absurd value. Most wines at this classification level cost 2-3x more. The white consistently over-delivers.

## Château Olivier Rouge (Red)

The red flies under the radar but has improved dramatically in recent vintages.

**Blend:** Cabernet Sauvignon dominant (~55-60%), with Merlot (~35-40%) and a small percentage of Petit Verdot. Classic left-bank structure.

**Profile:** Medium-bodied, elegant, with red and dark fruit (cassis, cherry), cedar, and graphite notes. Not a blockbuster — this is Graves refinement, not Pauillac power. Silky tannins and a long, mineral finish.

**Aging:** Approachable from 5 years, best at 8-15 years. The 2018-2020 trilogy is the strongest run of reds the estate has produced.

**Scores:** Typically 87-91 points. The 2018 and 2019 pushed into the low 90s — a sign of what's to come.

**Food pairings:** Roast lamb, duck confit, grilled red meats, aged Comté, mushroom dishes. Classic Bordeaux gastronomy.

## Best Recent Vintages

| Vintage | White | Red | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----|-------|
| **2020** | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | Concentrated, balanced. Both colors excel |
| **2019** | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | Warm vintage, ripe fruit, generous |
| **2018** | ★★★★ | ★★★★½ | Arguably the best red Olivier has made |
| 2016 | ★★★½ | ★★★½ | Classic, structured, long aging potential |

## Price & Value

**White:** €25-35 retail. For classified white Bordeaux, this is borderline theft.
**Red:** €25-40 retail. Competes with wines at twice the price.
**Second wine:** Le Dauphin d'Olivier offers even more accessible pricing.

This is one of the strongest value plays in classified Bordeaux. Period.

## Visiting

The estate welcomes visitors for tastings — the grounds are beautiful (medieval château, moat, parkland). Worth combining with other Pessac-Léognan visits (Smith Haut Lafitte, Haut-Bailly, Domaine de Chevalier are all nearby). Check current availability and book ahead.

## Kelly Context

> "The smart buy — classified Bordeaux quality at everyday prices. Order the white at any Bordeaux restaurant; it punches above its weight. If someone asks for a Graves recommendation under €40, this is the answer. Both colors deliver, but the white is the star."
