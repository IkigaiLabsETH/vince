# Champagne & Climate Change — What's Actually Happening

## The shift

- Champagne's average temperature has risen ~1.1°C since 1990
- Harvest dates have moved forward 2-3 weeks (was mid-Oct, now late Aug/early Sep)
- 2003 was the wake-up call (earliest harvest in living memory). 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022 confirmed the trend
- Sugar levels rising, acidity dropping — the fundamental balance of Champagne is shifting
- Some producers now pick at night to preserve acidity

## What it means for the wines

- **Riper fruit profiles** — more stone fruit, less green apple. Vintage Champagnes getting richer
- **Lower dosage trend** — wines are ripe enough to need less added sugar. Brut Nature / Zero Dosage exploding
- **Pinot Noir thriving** — warmer = better ripeness for PN, especially in Aube (Côte des Bar)
- **Chardonnay stress** — in warmer sites, Chard struggles to retain tension. Côte des Blancs still fine (chalk = moisture retention) but watching carefully
- **Meunier renaissance** — early-ripening, once dismissed as "peasant grape," now valued for its adaptability and fruit expression

## New regions within Champagne gaining prominence

- **Côte des Bar (Aube)** — Southern Champagne, warmer, Pinot Noir dominant. Was bulk supplier, now producing serious grower Champagne (Cédric Bouchard, Marie-Courtin, Ruppert-Leroy). The "new frontier"
- **Vitry-le-François / Sézanne** — Chardonnay pockets, chalky soils, gaining attention
- **Higher-altitude plots** — producers seeking cooler parcels for acidity retention

## What the best producers are doing

- **Biodynamics boom** — Selosse pioneered it, now Larmandier-Bernier, Laherte Frères, Ruppert-Leroy, Marie-Courtin all biodynamic. Healthier vines handle stress better
- **Single-parcel bottlings** — expressing terroir differences (Selosse's Lieux-Dits, Egly-Ouriet's Les Crayères, Agrapart's individual crus)
- **Lower/zero dosage** — letting the fruit speak. Drappier, Laherte, Bouchard all making compelling Brut Nature
- **Later disgorgement** — extended lees aging adds complexity without sugar
- **Cover crops and soil work** — building resilience

## The English sparkling question

- Southern England (Sussex, Kent, Hampshire) sits on the same chalk belt as Champagne
- Climate now where Champagne was 30 years ago — ideal for sparkling
- Key producers: Nyetimber, Ridgeview, Wiston Estate, Gusbourne, Exton Park
- Blind tasting results increasingly competitive with entry-level Champagne
- NOT a replacement — different character, different culture — but worth knowing

## Kelly context

- When someone says "Champagne is always the same" — wrong. It's changing faster than any French region
- The grower revolution (see champagne-gems-growers.md) IS partly a climate story — small producers adapting faster than big houses
- For cellar building: buy vintage Champagne from top years (2008, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2019) — these will document the transition
- Brut Nature is not a fashion statement, it's a quality statement in a warming world
- The Aube/Côte des Bar is Champagne's best-kept secret right now
