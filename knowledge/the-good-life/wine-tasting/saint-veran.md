# Saint-Véran, Mâconnais, Burgundy — Deep Dive

## Overview

**Saint-Véran** is a **Mâconnais** AOC in southern Burgundy; **Chardonnay only**. It produces **dry white** wines that are **lighter and more affordable** than Côte de Beaune whites (Meursault, Puligny, Chassagne) but still **Burgundy** in character: apple, citrus, stone, a touch of roundness. **Value** entry to white Burgundy; good for "Burgundy style without the price of Meursault."

## Geography and terroir

- **Location:** South of the Côte Chalonnaise; wraps around **Pouilly-Fuissé** (Saint-Véran and Pouilly-Fuissé share the same type of limestone and similar climate). Two zones: one near Fuissé (e.g. Chânes, Leynes), one near the Saône (e.g. Chasselas, Prissé). **Limestone and clay;** no grand cru or premier cru — village-level only.
- **Why it matters:** Same grape as Chablis and Côte de Beaune (Chardonnay) but **warmer, earlier-ripening**; wines are **softer, fruit-forward**, less mineral than Chablis, less rich than Meursault. **Drink young** (2–6 years) for freshness.

## Style and profile

- **Aromatics:** Apple, pear, lemon, white flowers; sometimes a hint of hazelnut or butter if oak is used (many are **unoaked** or lightly oaked).
- **Palate:** Medium body; **approachable, easy-drinking**; acidity fresh but not searing. **Value** for "Burgundy Chardonnay" without paying for Puligny or Meursault.
- **When to recommend:** "Value white Burgundy," "Burgundy Chardonnay under $X," "something like Meursault but cheaper," "easy white for lunch or seafood."

## Producers to know

- **Domaine des Deux Roches:** Reliable; classic Saint-Véran.
- **Domaine Saumaize-Michelin:** Quality; mineral, clean.
- **Château de Fuissé (Jean-Jacques Vincent):** Pouilly-Fuissé focus but also Saint-Véran; good reference.
- **Domaine Lassarat:** Saint-Véran; traditional.
- **Louis Latour, Joseph Drouhin, etc.:** Négociant bottlings; consistent, widely available.
- **Domaine Guffens-Heynen (Verget):** High-end Mâconnais; Saint-Véran when available; precise.

## Vintage (short)

Drink young; 2–6 years. Strong vintages (2019, 2020, 2022) are fresh and fruity. For "drink now" suggest 2022 or 2023.

## Service

- **Temperature:** 9–11 °C. Do not overchill.
- **Glass:** White Burgundy or universal white.

## Food pairings

- **Classic:** Goat cheese, light seafood, roast chicken, salads, fish in butter or light sauce. **Versatile** everyday white.
- **Avoid:** Very heavy or spicy (wine is medium-bodied).

## Guest-led

- **"Value white Burgundy"** → Saint-Véran; "Chardonnay from the Mâconnais; apple and citrus; drink young; great value."
- **"Something like Meursault but cheaper"** → Saint-Véran or Pouilly-Fuissé; "same grape, southern Burgundy; rounder than Chablis, lighter than Meursault."
- **"Easy white for seafood or lunch"** → Saint-Véran; "Burgundy style, approachable, 2–6 years."
