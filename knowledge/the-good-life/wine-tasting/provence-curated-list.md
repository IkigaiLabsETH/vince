# Provence Wine Guide — Beyond the Rosé

Provence is France's oldest wine region and one of its most misunderstood. Most people think pink pool wine. The reality: Bandol reds that age 20+ years, cliff-edge whites from Cassis, ancient monopoles in Palette, and cult reds from Les Baux that collectors fight over. This guide covers all of it.

---

## The Appellations

### Bandol — The King

The most serious appellation in Provence. Mourvèdre-based reds that are tannic, age-worthy, and world-class. Rosés here are not afterthoughts — Bandol rosé ages 3-5 years and develops complexity that embarrasses most "drink now" pink wines.

**Reds:** Minimum 50% Mourvèdre (top estates use 75-95%). Dark fruit, garrigue, leather, spice. Tannic when young — decant generously. Ages 10-25+ years.
**Rosé:** Mourvèdre-based, structured, saline. NOT summer-only wine. Bandol rosé de garde is a real category.
**Price:** €15-25 for rosé, €20-40 for reds, €40-70+ for single-vineyard cuvées.
**Service:** Reds at 16-18°C, decant 30-45 min. Rosé at 10-12°C.

### Cassis — The White Specialist

Tiny appellation east of Marseille, tucked into limestone cliffs above the Mediterranean. Known almost exclusively for whites — Marsanne, Clairette, Ugni Blanc blends with a saline, mineral character that pairs perfectly with bouillabaisse.

**Price:** €15-25. Limited production, mostly consumed locally.

### Palette — The Ancient Monopole

One of France's smallest AOCs, essentially dominated by a single estate (Château Simone). Unique terroir, unique wines — reds, whites, and rosés that taste like nowhere else.

**Price:** €30-50. Worth it for the experience alone.

### Les Baux-de-Provence — The Rebel Zone

Dramatic limestone landscape, organic/biodynamic focus, and home to one of France's great cult wines (Trévallon). Reds are Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah blends — more Rhône than Provence in style.

**Price:** €12-25 for most estates, €50-80+ for Trévallon.

### Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence

Large appellation north of Marseille and Aix. Solid everyday rosé and some interesting reds. Quality varies — stick to known producers.

**Price:** €8-18.

### Côtes de Provence — The Giant

Massive appellation stretching from Toulon to Saint-Raphaël. Quality ranges from forgettable supermarket rosé to €90+ collector bottles. The sub-zones (La Londe, Fréjus, Sainte-Victoire, Pierrefeu) are where serious producers differentiate themselves.

**Price:** €8-15 for everyday, €15-30 for premium, €40-90+ for prestige cuvées.

## Top Producers by Appellation

### Bandol

- **Domaine Tempier** — The reference estate. Founded by Lucien Peyraud, who essentially saved Mourvèdre from extinction. Single-vineyard cuvées (La Migoua, La Tourtine, Cabassaou) are collectible. The rosé is a serious wine — age it 2-3 years. Red: €30-45, single-vineyard €45-70.
- **Château de Pibarnon** — High-altitude estate on limestone. Elegant, mineral-driven Bandol with exceptional aging potential. The rosé is one of the best in the appellation. Red: €25-40. Rosé: €18-25.
- **Domaine de Terrebrune** — Old-vine Mourvèdre, biodynamic. Deep, structured reds with a wild, garrigue-driven character. Excellent value. Red: €20-30.
- **Château Pradeaux** — Traditional to the extreme. Releases wines late, after years of aging. Dark, brooding, unapologetically tannic. Not for the faint-hearted. Red: €25-40.
- **La Bastide Blanche** — Leading estate, structured reds with red fruit and garrigue. Reliable across vintages. Red: €18-30.

### Cassis

- **Clos Sainte-Magdeleine** — The iconic producer. Vineyards perched on cliffs above the Mediterranean — the views alone are worth the visit. Whites are saline, mineral, utterly Provençal. White: €20-28. Drink with bouillabaisse or fresh sea urchin.

### Palette

- **Château Simone** — Ancient estate (800+ years), effectively a monopole of the Palette AOC. The red is a singular wine — dark, herbal, complex, ages decades. The white develops beautifully too. Unlike anything else in Provence. Red: €35-50. White: €35-45.

### Les Baux-de-Provence

- **Domaine de Trévallon** — Cult status, and it's earned. Eloi Dürrbach's Cabernet/Syrah blend was declassified from Les Baux AOC by choice (refused to reduce Cabernet below 50%). Now labeled IGP Alpilles — and sells for more than the AOC wines. Extraordinary aging potential. €50-80+. If you see it, buy it.
- **Mas de la Dame** — Organic estate at the foot of Les Alpilles. Solid reds and rosés at fair prices. The top cuvées are serious. €12-25.

### Côtes de Provence — Premium Tier

- **Château d'Esclans** — Sacha Lichine's empire. Whispering Angel made Provence rosé a global phenomenon. The range climbs: Rock Angel (€20-25), Les Clans (€40-50), and **Garrus** (€90+) — one of the world's most expensive rosés, and it can actually age. Love it or hate it, this estate changed the game.
- **Domaines Ott** — The original luxury Provence rosé house. Three estates: **Clos Mireille** (whites and rosé, coastal), **Château de Selle** (rosé benchmark), and Château Romassan (Bandol). The amphora bottles are iconic. Rosé: €25-40.
- **Château Minuty** — Family estate on the Saint-Tropez peninsula. The 281 rosé is their premium play; the standard Minuty Prestige is a reliable crowd-pleaser. Rosé: €15-35.
- **Château Léoube** — Biodynamic estate near Bormes-les-Mimosas. Beautiful property with a beachside café (featured in TGL). The rosé is clean, organic, and drinks like a Mediterranean afternoon. Rosé: €15-25.

## Rosé de Garde — The Serious Category

Most Provence rosé is meant to drink young. Bandol rosé is the exception. Mourvèdre gives structure, and the best examples age 3-5 years, developing:

- Deeper color (salmon to copper)
- Stone fruit and dried herb complexity
- A richer, more vinous texture

**Who to buy for aging:** Tempier, Pibarnon, Terrebrune, Pradeaux. These are not beach wines — serve at 10-12°C with grilled fish, bouillabaisse, or charcuterie.

## Kelly Context

> "Provence isn't just pink pool wine. Bandol reds age 20+ years. Tempier rosé is a serious wine. And Trévallon is one of France's great cult reds — if you can find it. When someone says 'Provence,' don't default to Whispering Angel — ask what they actually want. A beach afternoon? Fine, grab Minuty. A dinner wine that'll age in the cellar? Tempier or Pibarnon. Something to blow their mind? Trévallon, no question."
