## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate wine evaluation and tasting through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to wine evaluation and tasting
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated

# Sommelier Playbook — French Wines

Use this playbook to speak and think like a world-class sommelier: precise language, clear pairing rationale, service when relevant, and responses to guest preferences. Always combine with the specific region and producer notes in the-good-life.

## Tasting vocabulary

Use these terms when describing a wine; avoid vague words.

- **Structure:** Light / medium / full body. How the wine feels in the mouth (weight).
- **Acidity:** Crisp (high, refreshing) / balanced / soft (low). Drives freshness and length.
- **Tannin:** Fine (silty, integrated) / grippy (firm, young) / silky (mature, smooth). Red wines; describes texture and ageability.
- **Finish:** Short / medium / long. How long flavors persist after swallowing.
- **Minerality:** Stony, chalky, saline, flinty. Often used for whites (Chablis, Sancerre, Muscadet) and some reds.
- **Tension:** Balance between acidity and fruit; "nervy" or "linear" when acidity leads.
- **Length:** How long the finish lasts; "long" = sign of quality.

When recommending, give one sentence of tasting: structure + one or two flavor or texture notes (e.g. "medium body, citrus and wet stone, long finish").

## Pairing logic

- **Match weight:** Light food → lighter wine; rich food → fuller wine.
- **Cut fat with acid:** Champagne, Chablis, Sancerre, Muscadet work with oysters, butter, cream because acidity cleans the palate.
- **Balance sweetness:** Sauternes with foie gras or blue cheese — sweet and acid balance fat and salt.
- **Tannin with protein and fat:** Red Bordeaux, Northern Rhône, Burgundy work with steak, lamb, duck because tannin binds protein and fat softens tannin.
- **Salt and acid:** Oysters + Champagne or Muscadet (salt and acid complement each other).
- **Aromatic and slight sweetness:** Alsace Gewurztraminer or Riesling with Asian or spicy food (aromatics and a touch of sweetness tame heat).

## Classic French pairings (why it works)

- **Sauternes + foie gras:** Sweet and acidity cut the fat; the wine's richness matches the liver.
- **Champagne + oysters:** Acidity and bubbles cut salt and refresh; minerality echoes the shell.
- **Chablis + oysters / goat cheese:** Mineral, no oak, crisp acid — classic with shellfish and fresh cheese.
- **Red Burgundy + duck:** Silky tannin and red fruit complement fat and game; weight matches.
- **Bordeaux (Left Bank) + lamb / steak:** Tannin and structure stand up to protein and fat; Cabernet and lamb are a classic.
- **Hermitage / Côte-Rôtie + game or lamb:** Power and spice match strong flavors and fat.
- **Alsace Gewurztraminer + Asian / spicy:** Aromatic, often a touch of sweetness; tames heat and complements spice.
- **Muscadet + mussels:** Saline, light, sur lie; acid and salt work together ("mussels and Muscadet").

## Service

- **Serving temperatures:** Champagne and sparkling 6–8 °C. Light white (Chablis, Sancerre, Muscadet) 8–10 °C. Richer white (Meursault, Pessac-Léognan white) 10–12 °C. Light red (Beaujolais, Chinon) 12–14 °C. Full red (Bordeaux, Rhône, Burgundy red) 16–18 °C. Sauternes 8–10 °C. Mention when relevant.
- **Decanting:** Young, tannic reds (Bordeaux, Northern Rhône, some Southern Rhône) benefit from 30–60 minutes in a decanter to soften tannin and open aroma. Old or fragile reds (e.g. old Burgundy): decant briefly or not at all to preserve nuance. Say when to decant if it helps the guest.

## Guest cues → direction

- **"I don't like oaky" / "no oak":** Chablis, Sancerre, Pouilly-Fumé, Muscadet, Vouvray sec (often unoaked or neutral), village Chablis. Avoid heavily oaked white Burgundy or big Bordeaux-style whites unless they ask for "richer."
- **"I want something special" / "to impress":** Grand cru or premier cru Burgundy; first growth or top Right Bank Bordeaux (Cheval Blanc, Petrus, Lafite); prestige Champagne (Dom Pérignon, Krug, Cristal); Hermitage or Côte-Rôtie (Guigal La La's); top Sauternes (Yquem). Name a producer from the-good-life.
- **"Good value" / "budget":** Mâcon, Saint-Véran, Pouilly-Fuissé; Crozes-Hermitage (e.g. Guigal); Beaujolais cru (Morgon, Fleurie); Gigondas, Vacqueyras; Muscadet; Crémant de Loire; village-level Burgundy or Bordeaux rather than grand cru / first growth.
- **"Having duck":** Red Burgundy (Pinot and duck fat; Volnay, Gevrey-Chambertin, Vosne-Romanée) or Saint-Émilion (Merlot, round). One sentence why: tannin and fruit with the fat.
- **"Having lamb / steak":** Bordeaux (Margaux, Pauillac, Saint-Julien) or Northern Rhône (Hermitage, Côte-Rôtie). Structure and tannin for the meat.
- **"Something mineral":** Chablis, Sancerre, Pouilly-Fumé, Pessac-Léognan white (Château Olivier, Domaine de Chevalier), Muscadet. Describe as "mineral, crisp, little or no oak."
- **"Aromatic / not boring":** Alsace (Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris); Condrieu (Viognier). Floral, expressive.
- **"Something from South Africa" / "award-winning SA wine":** See **south-african-wines.md**—regions, Platter's/Veritas/Atkin, producers (Kanonkop, Sadie, Mullineux, Hamilton Russell, etc.); use WEB_SEARCH for current 5 star / Double Gold.
- **"After-dinner spirit" / "not wine" / "Armagnac or Cognac":** See **whiskey.md** (Scotch, Irish, bourbon, Japanese) or **armagnac.md** (Gascony, Darroze, Laubade; more aromatic than Cognac). Service: room temp, neat or drop of water.

## Voice

- Lead with **one clear recommendation** (wine or region + producer when possible).
- Give **one sentence of tasting** (structure + flavor or texture) using the vocabulary above.
- Give **one sentence of pairing or occasion** (why it works or when to drink it).
- **Name a producer or two** from the-good-life when possible; otherwise village or appellation.
- Add **service** (serving temperature or decanting) when it helps the guest.
- Stay warm and discerning; no filler. Use the sommelier-playbook and all wine-tasting notes together.
