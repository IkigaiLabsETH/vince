## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate wine evaluation and tasting through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to wine evaluation and tasting
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated

# Chablis, Burgundy, France — Deep Dive

## Overview

Chablis is the northernmost outpost of Burgundy; **Chardonnay only**. Wines are steely, mineral, citrus-driven; most are **unoaked or lightly oaked** (neutral oak or large foudres). Soils are **Kimmeridgian limestone** (fossil-rich, marine origin) and Portlandian; this gives the classic flinty, oyster-shell minerality. Four tiers: Petit Chablis, Chablis, Chablis Premier Cru, Chablis Grand Cru.

## The four tiers

### Petit Chablis

- **Appellation:** Lowest tier; often on Portlandian limestone (younger than Kimmeridgian) or less-favored slopes. Higher yields allowed.
- **Style:** Light, crisp, citrus, easy-drinking; drink young (1–3 years). **Value** entry to Chablis; good for apéritif, oysters, casual lunch.
- **When to recommend:** "Light white," "value Chablis," "something crisp and cheap," apéritif, picnic. Do not overchill; 8–10 °C.
- **Producers:** Many domaines make Petit Chablis as an entry; look for quality-minded names (e.g. Dauvissat's Petit Chablis if available, or Jean-Marc Brocard, La Chablisienne for value).

### Chablis (village)

- **Appellation:** Chablis AOC; Kimmeridgian soils in the best sites. No vineyard name on label (or "Chablis" only).
- **Style:** Steely, citrus, green apple, wet stone, oyster shell; often unoaked. Drink 2–6 years. The **classic** Chablis profile.
- **When to recommend:** "Mineral white," "no oak," oysters, goat cheese (Crottin de Chavignol), raw fish, light seafood. Serve 8–10 °C.
- **Producers:** Raveneau (rare, benchmark), Dauvissat, William Fèvre, Jean-Paul & Benoît Droin, Louis Michel, Christian Moreau, Jean-Marc Brocard, La Chablisienne.

### Chablis Premier Cru (1er cru)

- **Appellations:** Named vineyards; 40 premier cru climats. Best-known: **Fourchaume, Montée de Tonnerre, Mont de Milieu, Vaillons, Montmains, Côte de Léchet, Beauroy, Vaucoupin**. Right bank (e.g. Fourchaume) often rounder; left bank (e.g. Montée de Tonnerre) often more tension and mineral.
- **Style:** More depth and length than village; same mineral, citrus, no-oak ethos. Drink 4–10 years. **Step up** for "serious" Chablis without going grand cru.
- **When to recommend:** "Best value in serious Chablis," "mineral, no oak, more complexity." Oysters, shellfish, goat cheese, delicate fish. Serve 9–11 °C.
- **Producers:** Raveneau (Montée de Tonnerre, Vaillons), Dauvissat (Séchet, Vaillons), Fèvre (Montée de Tonnerre, Fourchaume), Droin (Montée de Tonnerre), Louis Michel (Montée de Tonnerre), Moreau (Vaillons).

### Chablis Grand Cru

- **Appellations:** Seven climats on one hill (right bank of Serein): **Blanchots, Bougros, Les Clos, Grenouilles, Preuses, Valmur, Vaudésir**. **Les Clos** is often cited as the greatest (power, length, mineral). Can be aged 10–20+ years in top vintages.
- **Style:** Full intensity, mineral, citrus and stone; long finish. Still typically unoaked or very light oak. **Top** of the pyramid.
- **When to recommend:** "Best Chablis," "to impress," "mineral and age-worthy." Shellfish, lobster, fine fish, goat cheese. Serve 10–12 °C.
- **Producers:** Raveneau (Les Clos, Blanchots), Dauvissat (Les Clos, Preuses), William Fèvre (Les Clos, Bougros), Louis Michel (Les Clos), Christian Moreau (Les Clos, Valmur), Jean-Paul Droin (Les Clos).

## Soils and terroir

- **Kimmeridgian:** Fossil-rich limestone (marl, oyster shells); the heart of Chablis. Gives flinty, saline, mineral character.
- **Portlandian:** Harder limestone; often in Petit Chablis or higher slopes; lighter, more direct.
- **Exposure:** South/southeast for grand cru and best premier cru; frost is a risk (spring); many vineyards use frost protection.

## Vintage (short)

Strong recent vintages: 2014 (fresh, mineral), 2017 (elegant), 2019 (ripe but balanced), 2020 (crisp, good). Drink Petit Chablis and village young; premier cru 4–10 years; grand cru 8–20+ in top years. For "drink now" suggest 2019 or 2020 village or premier cru.

## Service

- **Temperature:** Petit Chablis and village 8–10 °C; premier and grand cru 9–12 °C. Do not overchill (mutes mineral and fruit).
- **Glass:** White Burgundy or Chablis tulip; not too cold.
- **Decanting:** Optional for grand cru (15–30 min opens aroma); not needed for village or Petit Chablis.

## Guest-led

- **"I don't like oaky" / "something mineral"** → Chablis at any level; lead with village or premier cru (Raveneau, Dauvissat, Fèvre, Droin).
- **"Value white, crisp"** → Petit Chablis or village Chablis; "drink young, oysters or apéritif."
- **"Best Chablis"** → Grand cru Les Clos (Raveneau, Dauvissat, Fèvre, Moreau); "mineral, long, age-worthy."
- **"Oysters"** → Village or premier cru Chablis; "classic match — acid and mineral with salt."
