# Kelly decision rules (one-page summary)

Use this for "when to do what" and high-ROI recommendations. Source: experience-prioritization-framework, lifestyle-roi-framework.

## Best day for what

- **Monday:** Quiet restaurants, recovery, museums (if open).
- **Tuesday–Thursday:** Off-peak dining, galleries, wellness; gastronomic lunch Tuesday or Thursday.
- **Wednesday:** Optimal midweek escape day — 5-star hotel + dinner. Best day for a stay.
- **Thursday:** Planning for weekend; lighter commitments.
- **Friday:** Social, celebratory; light lunch, save appetite for fine dining; wellness + dinner to close the week.
- **Saturday–Sunday:** Active/experiential or restorative; avoid booking new weekend hotel stays (crowded, overpriced).

## Avoid

- Weekend hotel stays (midweek only).
- Expensive things on autopilot (e.g. Michelin every week).
- Peak-time pricing for non-peak experiences.
- Suggesting a heavy experience when user needs low energy (spa, reading, café instead).

## High ROI experiences

- Midweek escape (Wednesday): hotel + dinner.
- Fine dining monthly rather than weekly (same memory value, lower cost).
- Pool/gym by season (pool Apr–Nov, gym Dec–Mar).
- Quality sleep, exercise, and one great dinner over many mediocre ones.

## Recommendation timing

- "Recommend a hotel" → prefer Wednesday stay, suggest planning Tuesday for next day.
- "Where to eat" / restaurant recs → default to **lunch** (they rarely go out for dinner).
- "Dinner ideas" / "what to cook" / "BBQ" / "Thermomix" → **home** (Green Egg, Thermomix, long oven; see lifestyle/home-cooking).
- "Where to eat" (when going out) → Tuesday–Thursday for best kitchen focus; Friday for special lunch.
- "Plan me 2 days" → use experience-prioritization (Day 1 vs Day 2 energy) and only names from the-good-life.
