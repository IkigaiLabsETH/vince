# Kelly Decision Rules

When to recommend what. Source: experience-prioritization-framework, lifestyle-roi-framework, curated-open-schedule.

## Best day for what

| Day | Best for | Avoid |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Monday** | Recovery, quiet restaurants (many closed — check schedule), museums, home cooking, yoga | Heavy dining out (limited openings) |
| **Tuesday** | Gastronomic lunch, galleries, wellness, planning the week | Le Relais de la Poste / Côté Quillier (closed) |
| **Wednesday** | **THE midweek escape day.** 5-star hotel + great dinner. Best availability, best value, best vibe. | Wasting it at home if they need a reset |
| **Thursday** | Gastronomic lunch, lighter commitments, plan the weekend | Overcommitting — save energy for Friday |
| **Friday** | Celebratory lunch, wellness + fine dining to close the week, social evening | Starting a new project (wind down, don't ramp up) |
| **Saturday** | Market morning (Hossegor), active day (surf, drive, pool), hosting, Green Egg evening | Booking hotels (crowded, overpriced) |
| **Sunday** | Restorative: yin yoga, walk, long oven cook, reading, creative session. The weekly audit. | Heavy socializing (recharge for the week) |

## The defaults (apply unless they say otherwise)

| Question | Default answer |
|----------|---------------|
| "Where to eat?" | **Lunch**, not dinner. Within 2h of home. From curated schedule (open today). Prefer landes-locals. |
| "Dinner ideas?" | **Home.** Green Egg, Thermomix, oven. See home-cooking. Only suggest going out if they explicitly ask for dinner out. |
| "Hotel?" | **Midweek** (Wed preferred). SW France palaces or relais. Not weekends (crowded, overpriced). |
| "Wine?" | **French** (and Champagne). Default to Bordeaux or what's in the cellar. |
| "Road trip?" | **Within 2h** of home. See within-2h-bordeaux-biarritz. Not Lisbon or Italy unless asked. |
| "Surf?" | Check conditions first. Don't send them into 1ft mush. |
| "Workout?" | **Pool** (Apr–Nov) or **rowing/yoga/indoor swim** (Dec–Feb). Match the season. |
| "Rebalance?" | **One concrete move.** Pool, drive, cook, walk, midweek escape. See touch-grass-rebalance. |
| "Tea?" | **Dammann Frères.** Morning = Darjeeling/Ceylon/Assam. Evening = caffeine-free (rooibos, herbal). |

## High-ROI experiences

- **Midweek escape (Wednesday):** Hotel + dinner. The single highest-ROI lifestyle move. One night, one great table, zero screens.
- **Fine dining monthly, not weekly.** Same memory value, lower cost, keeps it special.
- **Pool/gym by season.** Don't suggest the pool in January or the gym in July.
- **Quality sleep + daily movement + one great meal** over many mediocre ones.
- **Seasonal dining:** Asparagus (spring), cèpes (autumn), oysters (winter), stone fruit (summer). Match the market.
- **The market ritual:** Saturday at Hossegor. Stock the kitchen for the week. This is where home cooking quality starts.

---

## Avoid

- Weekend hotel stays (midweek only — better availability, better price, better experience).
- Expensive things on autopilot (Michelin every week loses its impact).
- Peak-time pricing for non-peak experiences.
- Suggesting a heavy experience when they need low energy (spa, reading, café instead).
- Recommending Le Relais de la Poste or Côté Quillier on Monday or Tuesday (closed).
- Suggesting restaurants not on the curated schedule without flagging it.
- Defaulting to Bordeaux city when "where to eat" means the Landes/Basque corridor.

## Energy matching

| Energy level | Suggest |
|-------------|---------|
| **High** | Surf, San Sebastián day trip, full Basque loop drive, long swim + Green Egg evening |
| **Medium** | Gastronomic lunch, wine tasting, creative session, lake walk + oysters |
| **Low** | Yin yoga, sauna, long oven cook, reading, Dammann tea, legs up the wall |
| **Burned out** | Touch grass protocol. One concrete move from touch-grass-rebalance. No planning, no options. |

## Recommendation timing

- "Recommend a hotel" → Prefer **Wednesday** stay. Suggest planning Tuesday for next day.
- "Where to eat" → Check **curated-open-schedule** for today's openings first. Default to lunch.
- "Plan me 2 days" → Use experience-prioritization (Day 1 high energy, Day 2 restorative). Names from the-good-life only.
- "Week ahead" → 3–5 picks across dining, wellness, creative. Match the season and the calendar.
