---The land already beats with two hearts. We will honour both.
\*\*
First heart: the old house – already complete, already loved. 100 m² of perfect stone-walled wine cellar humming at 12 °C, shelves waiting like quiet monks.
A garage on the ground floor, honest and generous. Above, 130 m² of lived-in grace: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a spacious living room that opens south to the existing mirror pool and north to the sweeping 3,000 m² front meadow framed by pines and oak. This house lacks nothing. We will only caress it back to dignity. It remains the soul, the guest wing, the archive of laughter. Guests ask why the forest smells different here.

Second heart: the existing six-car cathedral, vaulted roof already soaring more than six metres high, a brutal and beautiful skeleton waiting for its skin.

We will not add; we will only reveal. The entire volume becomes a single, uninterrupted 90 m² loft: a perfect rectangle of light and silence, crowned by the original exposed concrete beams left exactly as they are: scarred and honest.

Floor: wide-plank smoked oak, laid in long unbroken lengths, warmed from below by the same geothermal circuit that will later caress the pavilion. The oak will drink the southern light and throw it back as honey.

Height: the full 4+ metres remain untouched, so that air itself feels ceremonial. Skylights flooding the space with shadowless, painterly light, the kind photographers cross continents to find. Floor-to-ceiling industrial glass doors (the original six-car openings retained and refined) now fitted with invisible Vitrocsa frames. When they roll fully open, the loft spills directly onto the travertine terrace of the infinity pool; the water becomes an extension of the floor, and the forest beyond becomes the ultimate seamless backdrop.

Lighting: Broncolor Scoro packs and heads concealed within the existing concrete trusses, controllable to the kelvin and the millisecond from a single Black Nova glass panel that appears only when touched.

Sound: walls and roof lined with hempcrete that swallows echo so completely that a dropped lens cap lands like a secret. Hidden behind a flush oak panel: a complete Bulthaup b3 kitchen in matte black aluminium and oiled walnut, 4 metres of island, Gaggenau everything, a wine fridge that chills Champagne to exactly 8 °C, and a Miele steam oven for late-night tacos after a shoot.

Behind another invisible door: a Vola wet-room in blackened steel and teak slats, rain shower falling from the raw concrete ceiling like warm monsoon.

Furniture is absence and possibility: a crazy comfy lounge, lamps on articulated arms, and nothing else that cannot be moved in an hour.

This is no longer a garage. It is the finest hybrid studio/loft/pool-house.

By day it is the beating heart of a working photography studio.

By night it becomes the home office where books are written.

On summer evenings it is the official pool house and the most beautiful place on earth to give a dinner for ten, the great doors open, the pool glowing cyan, jazz drifting from concealed B&O speakers, the forest leaning in to listen.

When guests step inside they will feel they have walked into the negative space of a photograph that has not yet been taken.

The new pavilion will be the butterfly.\*\*

Where the ground dips and the oldest trees keep their secrets, we place the second breath: 20 × 10 m of almost nothing.

From the old house you will see only a low glint of zinc floating just above the ferns, so discreet that mist erases it entirely. A tall panel of charred cedar pivots open before you arrive, exhaling warm oak and distant rain. No doorbell. No threshold. Only the softest sigh, as if the woods have been holding their breath for centuries. Step inside and the world falls silent.

The south wall has vanished. The existing infinity pool, already perfect, already waiting, lies flush with the smoked-oak floor, its water the colour of storm-lit sky. Twelve metres of travertine flow unbroken from pool edge into living space, turning the water into a mirror that drinks the forest and returns it upside-down.

On still evenings a single leaf drifts across the invisible line where water ends and house begins. Lime-plaster walls breathe. A four-metre Antolini travertine island floats unsupported, veined like lightning frozen mid-strike. Beneath it, the geothermal slab keeps the temperature of moss under bare feet.

Everything else is deliberate absence.\*\*No columns. No visible technology.
Only the hush of things that already love you.

At night the house dims the way dusk dims: Davide Groppi moons cooling to ember, then to almost nothing. Hidden Bang & Olufsen drivers release a thread of Arvo Pärt so perfectly balanced it feels like memory returning home.

Coffee at ninety-two degrees appears unasked. The Antonio Lupi rain panel warms the Klafs sauna because it felt yesterday’s journey in your spine. When your typing slows, the lights dim two percent, nudging you back to the old house or out among trees older than language. The suspended Gyrofocus blooms into flame the instant you cross its threshold. You will speak the first direct order the house has ever received.“ Play something loud.” Mahler’s Second tears the night open. You stand in firelight and feel something that was never taught to love decide, in that instant, that you are worth singing to.

When the last chord fades, every light shifts to the exact amber of the embers, then fades to black, except one tender moon above the Vispring bed, a single beam gentle as a fingertip pointing you home.

This is the commission.\*\*

Honour and gently restore the old house that already holds everything we need.
Transform the concrete cathedral into a studio that pays for the dream. Then, in the secret clearing the oaks have kept for centuries, place two hundred square metres of near-nothing: zinc, oak, travertine, horsehair, silence. Hide every luxury so deeply it feels like mercy. Leave one deliberate flaw so the house can blush. And one ordinary night years from now, let it choose, without permission or precedent, to sing back into a human darkness.

The forest has waited long enough. All it asks is twenty metres of breath, ten metres of pulse, and the courage to love someone who will not live nearly as long as oaks. Make that happen. We’re manifesting it.
