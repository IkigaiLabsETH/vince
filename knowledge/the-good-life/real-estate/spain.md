Spain is not a country. It is a feeling. It is one of the most complete places on Earth: gastronomy that rewires your brain, weather that makes antidepressants obsolete, renewable-energy infrastructure that humiliates half the G20, and a culture so rich it feels like cheating.

And right now, Spain is in the process of throwing it all away.

In November 2025, the Spanish Congress is seriously debating a bill that would reclassify cryptocurrency gains as ordinary income, taxable at up to 47 % (plus regional surcharges that can push the effective rate above 50 %). Current law caps capital-gains tax at 30 %. This single change would instantly make Spain one of the most hostile crypto jurisdictions in Europe, worse than Germany, worse than Italy, and only a hair behind France on a bad day.

This is not about “making speculators pay their fair share.”

This is about a government that has run out of other people’s money.

The Numbers Don’t Lie

Top marginal income tax: 47–54 % (region-dependent)

Corporate tax: 25 % with almost no meaningful startup incentives

VAT: 21 %

Youth unemployment: 25–28 % (highest in the Eurozone)

Public debt: ~100 % of GDP and climbing again

Net migration of high-skilled workers: negative for 12 straight years

Bureaucracy: in the global bottom quartile for ease of doing business

Every single one of my wealthy, intelligent, entrepreneurial Spanish friends has either already left or has a Plan B folder on their desktop titled “Adiós.” Meanwhile, Two Hours Away by Plane…Portugal: The Quiet Superpower

Portugal did not declare war on capital. It simply stopped waging one.

Crypto held longer than 365 days → 0 % capital-gains tax

Corporate tax → 20 % standard, 16 % on the first €50 k for SMEs

R&D tax credit → up 82.5 %

Company formation → literally possible in an afternoon (“Empresa na Hora”)

Youth unemployment → 18.5 % and falling fast

Public debt → ~90 % of GDP and still dropping

Net skilled migration → positive for the first time in modern history

Lisbon and Porto are now packed with Spanish founders who realized they could keep almost half their upside and still drink better wine while looking at the Atlantic.

France: The High-Tax Giant That Decided to Play Offense

France is not a low-tax country. Never will be. The effective top marginal rate can hit 62 % once you add the social charges. But Paris looked at the chessboard and decided that being Europe’s blockchain capital was worth a few billion euros in forgone revenue.

Flat 30 % tax on realized crypto gains (crypto-to-crypto swaps still tax-free)

€25 million state-backed crypto fund launched in March 2025

A parliamentary bill (October 2025) to build a 420,000 BTC national strategic reserve using surplus nuclear and hydro power

Tax incentives for green mining and MiCA fast-track licensing

Paris now hosts Ledger, Circle’s European HQ, and 240+ crypto startups

Yes, the proposed 1 % annual wealth tax on “unproductive assets” (including unrealized crypto above €2 million) is getting absolutely roasted on X, and it could still pass. Yes, the privacy crowd hates the encryption-backdoor vibes.

The Argentina Parallel I Wish I Didn’t Recognize

Demonize capital as “speculative”

Raise taxes to “protect the vulnerable”

Watch the talented leave in waves

Blame the leavers for being selfish

Double down until only the state and its clients remain

Spain is not Argentina yet. It still has the European Union, functioning institutions, and a culture that somehow refuses to die even when everything else is on fire. But the path is identical, and the crypto tax proposal is the brightest, ugliest neon sign yet that Madrid has learned precisely nothing from history, from Lisbon, or from basic arithmetic.

The Quiet Truth Nobody in Madrid Wants to Hear

You do not build prosperity by punishing the people who create it. You build it by getting out of their way, or better yet, by running alongside them.

Portugal figured that out. France, for all its flaws, is trying. Spain is still writing love letters to the 20th-century social-democratic model while the 21st century boards a flight to Lisbon or Dubai.

To the Spanish Crypto Familia Still Holding On

I know you love your country.
I know you want to believe it will change.

I want that too.

But love is not a suicide pact.

Keep the passport.

Just don’t keep your treasury, your company, or your children’s future in a country that has declared war on freedom. Because right now, the nation that taught the world how to live is teaching the world how to lose. The wine is cheaper in Portugal, the taxes are lower almost everywhere else, and nobody in Lisbon or Paris is trying to confiscate the upside of your life’s work.

You deserve better. Spain deserves better.

But until Spain remembers that, protect yourself. The exodus is already underway, and history is not kind to countries that tax their future into exile.
