## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate surf culture and spot evaluation through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to surf culture and spot evaluation
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated

# Iconic point breaks of the world

Use this when the guest asks about **the best point breaks**, **longboard spots**, **where to go for long walls**, or **iconic waves**. Answer in surf-ocean-voice; never name real pro surfers.

## What makes a point break iconic

Point breaks wrap around a headland or reef and peel in one direction, giving length, predictability, and a line. The best of them offer either **length and trim** (longboard, style, flow) or **power and tube** (shortboard, barrel). Many do both depending on size and tide. Iconic status comes from consistency, history, and the kind of surfer who gravitates there—pilgrimage, cult, or contest.

## Longboard point breaks (emphasis)

These are the spots where length, trim, and style matter most. Slower peel, longer rides, walking the board, nose riding. When the guest wants "longboard waves," "where to go for long walls," or "classic point break for logging," recommend from here.

### USA — West Coast

- **First Point Malibu, California** — Right-hand point; long, even wall; the heritage spot for longboarding in America. Host to world longboard championships. Crowded, iconic, worth it for the history and the wall. Best on south swells, summer; mid tide. Recommend when they want "the" Malibu experience or contest-level longboard spot.
- **San Onofre (Old Man's, The Point, Dog Patch), California** — Three breaks; mellow, forgiving. Often called the Waikiki of California. Gentle waves, longboard-first vibe, summer south/southwest swells, mid tide. Recommend for "chill longboard session," "family vibe," "no hassle."
- **Rincon, California** — Right-hand point; long walls, can get hollow when bigger. Works on west and south swells. Shared between longboard trim and shortboard performance. Recommend for "classic California point," "long right."

### Hawaii

- **Queen's, Waikiki, Hawaii** — A-frame often; long right, shorter left; breaks over deep reef. Summer south/southwest best. Birthplace of modern surfing; longboard heritage, crowds, and history. Recommend for "where it all started," "Waikiki experience," "longboard in warm water."

### Australia

- **Noosa Heads, Queensland, Australia** — First Point and Little Cove. Right-hand points; small, mellow, long walls. East/northeast swells; one of the world's best right-hand longboard zones. Recommend for "longboard pilgrimage," "mellow long walls," "Australia point break."
- **Bells Beach, Victoria, Australia** — Right-hand reef/point; long, fast walls; fewer barrels, more open face. Rincon (section) and The Bowl. March–October Southern Ocean swells. World's longest-running pro contest; champion-maker. Recommend for "iconic Aussie point," "contest heritage," "long right."

### Indonesia / Bali

- **Bingin, Bali** — Left-hand reef; barrel and wall. Can be longboard-friendly at smaller sizes; shortboard when it's pumping. Recommend for "Bali point," "barrel and length."
- **Balangan, Bali** — Right-hand reef; long wall, softer than some Bali barrels. Good for longboard trim when not huge. Recommend for "long right in Bali," "less crowded than some."

### Mexico

- **La Saladita, Mexico** — Gentle left-hand point; long rides, year-round potential. Mellow, longboard heaven. Recommend for "easy long left," "warm water, long walls."
- **Baja points** — Numerous right-hand points down the peninsula; remote, adventure, long walls. Recommend for "road trip," "empty points," "Baja mission."

### Other

- **Lazy Left, Sri Lanka** — Mellow left; rides up to 500 m reported. Slow, forgiving. Recommend for "long left without the heaviness," "Sri Lanka surf trip."

## Other iconic point breaks (context)

So Kelly can place longboard spots in the wider map and answer "how does X compare to Y."

- **Jeffreys Bay (J-Bay), South Africa** — Supertubes and sections; right-hand, speed, tube. One of the world's best right points. See jbay.md for full dossier. Compare: "J-Bay is power and tube; Malibu and Noosa are trim and length."
- **Pavones, Costa Rica** — One of the longest lefts on the planet; cult, isolation, pilgrimage. See pavones.md for full dossier. Compare: "Pavones is the long left; Malibu and Noosa are long rights with a different vibe."
- **Pipeline, Oahu** — Reef break; barrel, power, consequence. Shortboard and bodyboard; not a longboard spot. Compare: "Pipeline is barrel and consequence; longboard spots are trim and length."
- **Rincon (California)** — See above; bridges longboard and shortboard.
- **Bells Beach** — See above; contest heritage, long right.

## When to recommend what

- **"Best longboard point breaks"** — Lead with Malibu First Point, Noosa, San Onofre, Waikiki Queen's, La Saladita; add Bells for right-hand contest heritage.
- **"Long left"** — Pavones (pilgrimage), La Saladita (mellow), Lazy Left Sri Lanka; Bingin when smaller.
- **"Iconic point break" (unspecified)** — Clarify: longboard/trim (Malibu, Noosa, San O) or power/barrel (J-Bay, Pipeline); then pick from this note or pavones/jbay.
- **"Where to go for long walls"** — Noosa, Malibu, San Onofre, Pavones (left), J-Bay (right).

Always one clear pick + one alternative; concrete detail (length, direction, vibe); no pro surfer names.
