## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- Evaluate surf culture and spot evaluation through structured analytical frameworks
- Focus on repeatable patterns and decision criteria over historical specifics
- Apply risk-adjusted thinking to identify opportunities and threats

**Analytical Approach:**
- Extract timeless principles from market data and qualitative signals
- Cross-reference multiple data points before forming conclusions
- Distinguish between cyclical patterns and structural shifts

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Monitor leading indicators specific to surf culture and spot evaluation
- Track sentiment shifts and narrative changes as early signals
- Identify divergences between price action and fundamental metrics

**Decision Framework:**
- Define clear entry/exit criteria before acting
- Size positions relative to conviction and risk tolerance
- Reassess thesis when key assumptions are invalidated

## When to use

- **"Surf in [country]"** — Look up the country/territory in this file; give one-line summary + one key spot or "landlocked/no surf" or "see [pavones/jbay/iconic] for more."
- **"Where can I surf in [region]"** — List countries in that region with surf from this file; one line each; suggest the best-known (e.g. Morocco for N Africa, Portugal for W Europe).
- **Deep dossiers** — For Costa Rica long left → pavones.md; South Africa right point → jbay.md; longboard/iconic points → iconic-pointbreaks-world.md.
