# The Home Coast — Landes to Pays Basque

200+ kilometres of coastline from Arcachon to Hendaye. The most consistent surf in Europe, full stop. Beach breaks dominate the Landes — long, shifting sandbars shaped by Atlantic energy. South into the Pays Basque, the geology changes: reef breaks, point breaks, rock shelves. Atlantic swells arrive from NW to W. Offshore on E/SE winds. This is home.

## Landes Beach Breaks — North to South

### Biscarrosse Plage
Long stretch of sand, multiple peaks spread across kilometres. Less crowded than anything south of Seignosse. Good for longboarding on small days — mellow walls, easy paddle-outs between peaks. Parking is never a problem. The kind of beach where you pick your own peak and surf alone.

### Mimizan Plage
Consistent. Sandbars shift with the seasons but there's almost always something rideable. The beach faces due west and catches everything. Courant d'Huchet nearby if you want a post-surf nature walk through the dunes.

### Contis Plage
Quiet. Locals only, and not many of them. Set between high dunes with no commercial development in sight. Beautiful, remote, the Landes at its purest. Worth the drive when you want solitude.

### Moliets-et-Maâ
The Courant d'Huchet river mouth pushes sand into the lineup, creating sandbars that shift dramatically. Less consistent than the beaches to the south — but when the banks line up, it produces world-class waves. Hollow, fast, surprisingly powerful for a beach break this far north.

### Messanges
Local beach, mellow vibe. Not a destination wave — more of a progression spot. Clean peaks on the right day, never crowded. Good for a session when you want to surf without thinking too hard.

### Vieux-Boucau
Port d'Albret lake sits just behind the beach — good for flat-day activities. The surf is fun, particularly in summer when small swells produce clean, playful waves. Not the place for overhead barrels.

### Seignosse — Les Estagnots / Les Bourdaines / Le Penon
Three beaches, all world-class, separated by a few hundred metres of dune.

**Les Estagnots** hosts WSL events for a reason. Hollow, powerful, heavy beach break. The sandbars here create thick-lipped barrels that detonate on the inside. When it's 4-6 ft and offshore, this is as good as beach break surfing gets. When it's big, it's genuinely heavy — closeouts, hold-downs, current.

**Les Bourdaines** sits just north. Slightly more forgiving — the sandbars tend to create more workable walls alongside the barrels. Still powerful, just a touch more margin for error.

**Le Penon** is the northernmost of the three. Needs bigger swell to turn on, but when it does, the peaks are well-defined and the crowd thins out.

### Hossegor — La Gravière
The most famous beach break in the world. Shallow sandbars — sometimes barely waist-deep — create tubes that rival Pipeline. This is not an exaggeration. September and October are prime: early-season NW swells hit the summer-sculpted sandbars and produce barrel after barrel, breaking a stone's throw from the beach.

Kelly Slater called La Gravière one of the best waves anywhere. He wasn't being polite.

**Not for intermediates when it's on.** The wave jacks from flat to overhead in a few metres, throws a thick lip over almost-dry sand, and the wipeouts are violent. When it's 3-4 ft and clean, it's fun for competent surfers. When it's 6 ft+, it's for people who know exactly what they're doing.

### Hossegor — La Nord / La Centrale / La Sud
Three sections of Hossegor's main beach, south of La Gravière.

**La Nord** catches the most swell energy and produces the heaviest waves of the three. **La Centrale** is the middle ground — consistent, rideable across a range of swell sizes. **La Sud** is the mellower section, more forgiving, good when the rest of the beach is maxing out.

This stretch is the competition venue for the WSL Quiksilver Pro (now the Shiseido Tahiti Pro moved, but the Hossegor event endures under various names). When the event is on and the swell cooperates, you're watching the best surfers in the world on your home beach.

### Capbreton — La Piste / Santocha / VVF
South of the Capbreton jetty, which divides Hossegor from Capbreton.

**La Piste** can be exceptional — the jetty and the Gouf de Capbreton conspire to focus swell into well-defined peaks. On its day, as good as anything in Hossegor. **Santocha** is more mellow, a good option when La Gravière is too heavy. **VVF** is the southernmost section, consistent and less crowded.

The Gouf de Capbreton — the submarine canyon — starts right here. It shapes everything about why this stretch of coast gets the waves it does.

### Labenne
South of Capbreton, north of the Basque Country. Quieter beach, rarely crowded. The kind of spot you drive to when the main beaches are packed and you just want a wave to yourself. Nothing special, nothing bad — just honest beach break surf with space.

## Basque Country Breaks — North to South

### Ondres
The transition zone between Landes and Pays Basque. Still a beach break — the reefs haven't started yet. Less crowded than anything to the south, and catches the same swell. Solid backup option.

### Tarnos
Beach break near the Adour river mouth. The river pushes sediment that shapes the banks. Can produce fun waves, but water quality after rain is questionable (river runoff). Check the conditions.

### Anglet — Les Cavaliers / La Chambre d'Amour / VVF / Marinella
Four kilometres of beach with multiple peaks, each with its own character.

**Les Cavaliers** is the power spot — the most exposed section, catching the most swell. Heavy when it's big, long walls when it's medium. This is where Anglet's best surfers congregate.

**La Chambre d'Amour** is more sheltered, tucked against the northern cliff. Works when the rest of the coast is too big. A good bad-day option.

**VVF and Marinella** fill the middle ground. Consistent, work year-round, and spread the crowd across enough peaks that you can always find space.

### Biarritz — Grande Plage
The birthplace of European surfing. 1957 — Peter Viertel, screenwriter, borrowed a board and rode waves here while working on a film. Everything followed from that moment.

Today it's a tourist surf spot, but iconic. Works best on small to medium swells — the beach is short and the wave closes out when it gets overhead. Crowded in summer to the point of absurdity. Surf it early morning or in winter for the experience without the circus.

### Biarritz — Côte des Basques
The longboard mecca. A gentle, point-style wave that peels along the cliff base, producing long, glassy walls perfect for nose-riding and cross-stepping. This is where French surfing was born, and the vibe still carries that history.

**Best 2 hours either side of low tide.** At low, the rocks expose and the wave disappears. At high, the wave fattens and loses shape. Time it right.

The most crowded lineup in the Basque Country in summer. Dawn patrol or don't bother.

### Biarritz — Marbella
Below the lighthouse. Reef break, more advanced than anything else in Biarritz. Needs swell and the right tide to work, which keeps the crowd down. When it's on — fast, hollow, punchy. A proper wave hiding in plain sight.

### Bidart — Centre / Pavillon Royal / Erretegia / Parlementia
Four breaks spanning the Bidart coastline, each progressively more serious.

**Centre** and **Pavillon Royal** are mellower beach-reef combos. Fun on medium swells, forgiving, scenic.

**Erretegia** needs bigger swell to work but produces long, powerful walls when it does. The kind of wave that rewards good positioning and strong paddling.

**Parlementia** is the big-wave spot of the Basque coast. Breaks at 10-15 ft and beyond, a kilometre offshore. A genuine big-wave arena — jet-ski assists are common on the biggest days. When Parlementia is working, you can watch from the Bidart clifftop with a coffee and feel the ground shake. Not a wave to surf on a whim.

### Guéthary
The soul of Basque surfing. A small village perched on cliffs above a reef break that produces perfect left walls — long, mechanical, peeling along the rock shelf with power and precision.

**Les Alcyons** reef is the main event. The power wave. Fast, hollow, committing. The paddle-out requires knowledge of the channel, and the locals know it.

Localism here is real and earned. Small community, tight lineup, respect is mandatory. Don't paddle straight to the peak on your first visit. Sit on the shoulder, wait your turn, earn your position over sessions, not minutes.

Parlementia is visible from the cliff walk above the village — a reminder that the ocean here operates at a different scale.

### Saint-Jean-de-Luz — Lafitenia
Famous right-hand point break. Needs solid swell — 5 ft minimum to start breaking — which keeps it from working every day. But when it's on, Lafitenia is one of the best waves in France. Period.

The paddle-out is mellow. The wave offers long rides — proper point break surfing where you can set a line, pump through sections, and ride for 200+ metres on the right swell. The lineup is respectful: experienced surfers who know the wave and share it.

A wave that rewards patience. Check the forecast, wait for the right day, and it delivers.

### Hendaye — Les Deux Jumeaux
At the Spanish border, looking across the bay to the Jaizkibel cliffs in Spain. Mellow beach break, gentle waves, warm water (relatively — the bay is more sheltered). Perfect for beginners, longboarders, and anyone who wants an easy session with a spectacular backdrop.

The twin rocks (Les Deux Jumeaux) mark the beach. Cross the border into Hondarribia for lunch after your surf.

## Seasonal Guide

### September – November: Prime Season
NW swells arrive with increasing regularity. Water still warm — 18-20°C, 3/2mm or even a spring suit in September. La Gravière fires. Estagnots fires. The sandbars are at their best after summer's gentle sculpting, and the autumn swells light them up.

Offshore winds (E/SE) are more common than any other season. Glass-off evenings are frequent. This is when the Landes delivers waves that put it on the world stage. If you surf one season here, make it this one.

### December – February: Big Swell Season
Cold. 12-14°C water. 4/3mm wetsuit minimum, many go 5/4mm with boots and gloves in January-February. The Atlantic opens up and the swells get serious — week-long runs of overhead+ surf are common.

Hossegor can be massive and unrideable on the biggest days. When the beach breaks close out, the Basque reefs light up. Parlementia and Lafitenia come into their element. Guéthary gets heavy, perfect lefts.

The lineup thins. The tourists are gone. The surfers who remain are committed. Cold dawns, empty lineups, powerful waves. Winter here is raw and beautiful.

### March – May: Transition
Swells decrease in frequency and size. Water slowly warms. The coast settles into a calmer rhythm. Spring glass-offs — windless evenings where the ocean turns to mercury — are magic. Some of the best sessions of the year happen on random spring evenings when the swell cooperates and the wind dies.

Less crowd. More space. The kind of surfing that doesn't make highlight reels but feeds the soul.

### June – August: Summer
Smaller, inconsistent swell. The Landes beach breaks need solid swell to work, and summer rarely provides it. When it does arrive, dawn patrol is essential — by 10am the onshore wind kills it, and the crowd buries it.

Longboard weather. Fish weather. The Basque coast handles small swell better than the Landes — Côte des Basques, Lafitenia (if there's enough push), Guéthary on its smaller days. Water is at its warmest: 20-22°C. Shorty or 3/2mm.

The crowd is at its peak. Every beach, every wave, every parking spot. Adapt or suffer.

## Practical

### Wetsuits
- **Jun-Sep:** 3/2mm fullsuit (spring suit on the warmest days in August)
- **Oct-May:** 4/3mm fullsuit
- **Dec-Feb:** Some go 5/4mm. Boots and gloves on the coldest days. Hood if you run cold

### Forecast Sources
- **Surf-Report.com** — French, hyperlocal. The best source for individual beach conditions. Webcams on most spots
- **Windguru** — Wind and swell models. Detailed, customisable. The serious surfer's tool
- **Magicseaweed** — Good overview, swell charts, star ratings (take with a grain of salt)
- **Surfline** — Less granular for this coast than the French sources, but solid swell tracking

### Crowd Management
Dawn patrol. Always. Midweek if your schedule allows. The difference between a 7am Tuesday and an 11am Saturday at La Gravière is the difference between surfing and floating in a crowd.

**Most crowded:** La Gravière, Côte des Basques, Grande Plage (summer)
**Solitude options:** Contis, Messanges, Labenne, Ondres

### Localism
Present and real at Guéthary, La Gravière, Parlementia. This isn't aggression for its own sake — these are tight communities who surf these waves every day and have earned priority through years of commitment.

The protocol: Don't paddle straight to the peak. Sit on the shoulder. Take the waves that come to you. Make eye contact, nod, be present. Over multiple sessions, you earn your position. Rushing it earns you nothing but hostility.

At most other spots on this coast, localism isn't an issue. Just surf with basic etiquette and you'll be fine.

### Board Quiver for This Coast
- **Shortboard 5'10-6'2** — For Hossegor power. La Gravière, Estagnots, Les Cavaliers. Needs to handle steep drops and thick lips
- **Fish / mid-length 6'6-7'6** — Small days, Côte des Basques, summer surf. Speed generation when the wave doesn't provide it
- **Longboard 9'0+** — Summer, Basque points, Côte des Basques, Hendaye. Nose-riding weather

### The Gouf de Capbreton
A submarine canyon extending from Capbreton harbour out to 4,000 metres deep. One of the deepest canyons in the Atlantic, starting just metres from shore.

The Gouf concentrates and amplifies incoming swell. Deep water channels energy without losing it to friction, then releases it onto the shallow sandbars of Hossegor and Capbreton. This is why La Gravière — a beach break — produces waves that rival reef breaks three times its size. The geology is unique. The waves are the result.

Without the Gouf, Hossegor would be just another beach. With it, it's one of the most powerful beach breaks on Earth.

## Kelly's Context

This is home. Every wave referenced in this file is within 45 minutes of the house. Most are within 20.

**"La Gravière is pumping"** — Cancel everything. Rearrange the day. This is one of those sessions that you talk about for years. When the sandbars align and the swell hits, there is nowhere else to be.

**The coast road** from home to Biarritz — the Taycan drive — follows this exact stretch of surf. Every beach, every break, every car park is visible from the road. A surf check is a drive south.

**Rebalance day template:** Dawn patrol at Estagnots. Coffee after. Yoga at home. The ocean resets everything.

**Season awareness matters.** Don't suggest a beach day when La Gravière is 3 metres and closing out — that's a day for watching from the dune or driving south to the Basque reefs. Don't suggest a mellow longboard at Côte des Basques when the forecast shows 2m+ NW — it'll be blown out and chaotic. Read the conditions, match the suggestion.

**The hierarchy when swell is running:**
1. Check La Gravière / Estagnots first — if it's clean and rideable, that's the call
2. If it's too big or messy, move south to Capbreton (La Piste) or Anglet (Les Cavaliers)
3. If everything's maxed, the Basque reefs — Guéthary, Lafitenia — handle size with grace
4. If it's tiny, Côte des Basques or Hendaye on a longboard

This coast has a wave for every condition. The skill is matching the surfer to the spot to the swell.
