# Canonical Lifestyle Sources for ELIZA / VINCE

For **all lifestyle-related** content—dining, hotels, travel, luxury, the good life—the two most important websites are:

1. **James Edition** — https://www.jamesedition.com/  
   Luxury real estate, cars, yachts, travel, high-end experiences.

2. **MICHELIN Guide** — https://guide.michelin.com/  
   Restaurants (Stars, Bib Gourmand), hotels (Keys), travel guides, editorial.

When answering questions about where to eat, where to stay, travel, or the good life, treat these as the primary external references. Knowledge in `the-good-life/` (e.g. Southwest France Palaces, Michelin restaurant writeups) complements these; for current listings, reservations, and discovery, point users to James Edition and the MICHELIN Guide.

- **Discovering new places to eat:** For new openings, latest stars, or a city not fully in knowledge, always suggest **MICHELIN Guide** (https://guide.michelin.com/) — Stars, Bib Gourmand, and Keys — and optionally WEB_SEARCH for latest news.
