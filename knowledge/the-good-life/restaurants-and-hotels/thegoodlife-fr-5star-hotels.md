# TGL 5-Star Hotels & Palaces

Everything below is sourced from The Good Life (thegoodlife.fr) features. No fluff — just what you need to book smart.

---

## Paris

### Bvlgari Hotel Paris ★★★★★

Italian luxury on the Triangle d'Or — contemporary, not classical. This is the anti-George V: Milanese chic instead of French gilding.

- **The food:** Chef Niko Romito (3★ Michelin) runs Il Ristorante. Order the escalope milanaise or the spaghetti sauce tomate (Romito method — deceptively simple, impossibly good).
- **The rooms:** 57 suites designed by Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel. Silk walls, leather headboards, Italian marble bathrooms. Butler service via WhatsApp for suite guests.
- **Hidden gem:** The pool. Don't skip it. The onyx-lit bar serves a frozen-base Negroni that's worth arriving early for.
- **Price signal:** Comparable to neighboring palaces (Four Seasons George V, Prince de Galles). No official "palace" label but palace-level service, no question.
- **Address:** 30 Avenue George V, 75008 Paris
- **Web:** [bvlgarihotels.com](https://www.bvlgarihotels.com)

### Le Meurice — Palace

Dorchester Collection. Versailles-inspired but warmer than you'd expect — this isn't a museum, it's a living room for people with taste.

- **The food:** Restaurant Le Meurice Alain Ducasse (2★ Michelin). Le Dalí by Philippe Starck — surrealist ceiling painted by Ara Starck, favorite lunch spot of Parisian society.
- **The bar:** Bar 228. Arrive before 18h30 if you want a bar seat — live piano kicks in then and it fills fast.
- **The rooms:** 160 rooms/suites. Suite Executive Vue Tour Eiffel (80m²) delivers Tuileries + Eiffel Tower + Notre-Dame in one panorama. Renovation by Lally & Berger ongoing.
- **Address:** 228 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris
- **Web:** [dorchestercollection.com/paris/le-meurice](https://www.dorchestercollection.com/paris/le-meurice)

### Le Bristol Paris — Palace

Oetker Collection. Turned 100 in 2025 and hasn't slowed down. This is old-money Paris at its most polished.

- **Suite Eden:** The new flex — 110m², 5th floor, private terrace with its own spa (massage table, jacuzzi, sauna, hammam) plus La Mer treatments. You literally never need to leave.
- **The pool:** Rooftop. One of Paris's best. NOT in a basement — natural light, feels like a liner cabin. This matters more than you think.
- **The details:** Schumacher, Braquenié, Pierre Frey fabrics. Baguès Paris + Maison Charles vintage lighting sourced from the Saint-Ouen flea market. Decorators, take notes.
- **Address:** 112 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, 75008 Paris
- **Web:** [oetkerhotels.com/le-bristol-paris](https://www.oetkerhotels.com/le-bristol-paris)

### Madame Rêve ★★★★★

Laurent Taïeb (GLT group). Not a palace — punches above its weight with contemporary design and one of the best locations in Paris.

- **The penthouse:** 130m², views onto Saint-Eustache + Centre Pompidou skyline. Devialet sound system, cinema-grade screen. This is where you host.
- **Food & drink:** Restaurant La Plume delivers room service. 3 bars including one of Paris's most confidential rooftops — ask at reception, it's not obvious.
- **Address:** 48 Rue du Louvre, 75001 Paris
- **Web:** [madamereve.com](https://www.madamereve.com)

### Hôtel Le Pigalle ★★★★ (Boutique)

Not 5-star. Including it because it's culturally significant — this is the template every Paris boutique hotel has been copying since 2015.

- **The concept:** Pioneer of "hotel as neighborhood hub." 40 rooms designed by Festen architects — intemporel aesthetic that hasn't changed in 10 years (and doesn't need to).
- **The vibe:** Vinyl library, local coffee roaster, Distillerie de Paris cocktails. Now owned by Biografy group.
- **Address:** 9 Rue Frochot, 75009 Paris

## Alps — Ski

### Aman Le Mélézin — Courchevel 1850

Japanese-alpine fusion. If you want silence, precision, and zero scene, this is your mountain hotel.

- **Skiing:** Ski-in/ski-out on Bellecôte. No excuses.

- **Spa:** Iyashi Dôme (Japanese soft-heat sauna). Good for claustrophobes who can't handle traditional steam rooms.

### Le Strato ★★★★★ — Courchevel 1850

Family-owned by the Boix-Vives (Courchevel station pioneers). Intimate — feels like staying in a very well-appointed private house.

- **The rooms:** 25 rooms + 7 apartments. Small enough that staff knows your name by day two.
- **The food:** Restaurant Baumanière 1850 (2★ Michelin, Chef Thomas Prod'homme). This is one of the best meals in the Alps.

- **Web:** [hotelstrato.com](https://www.hotelstrato.com)

### Hôtel Barrière Les Neiges — Courchevel 1850, Palace

The full palace experience on the mountain. Open only 4 months a year (Dec–Apr) — staff refreshes each season.

### Hôtel Saint-Georges — Megève

- **Address:** 159 Rue Monseigneur Conseil, Megève
- **Web:** [hotelsaintgeorges-megeve.com](https://www.hotelsaintgeorges-megeve.com)

### Flocons de Sel — Megève

Chef Emmanuel Renaut (3★ Michelin). This is a restaurant with rooms — the food is the entire point.

- **The food:** Renaut forages herbs at dawn and hunts game in winter. Cuisine built on lake fish, forgotten vegetables, wild herbs. You won't eat like this anywhere else.
- **Also a hotel.** Stay the night — you'll want to after that tasting menu.
- **Address:** 1775 Route du Leutaz, Megève
- **Web:** [floconsdesel.com](https://www.floconsdesel.com)

### Experimental Chalet — Val d'Isère

## Morocco

### Kasbah d'If ★★★★★ — Desert d'Agafay

30 minutes from Marrakech but feels like another planet. Built as a traditional kasbah (pisé walls) over 6 years by two passionate owners.

- **The rooms:** 37 suites. Heated bathroom floors — trust me, this matters in January.
- **The spa:** Underground tunnel carved in rock over 4 years, glass walls onto Atlas mountains. Possibly the most beautiful spa in Morocco. Not an exaggeration.
- **Pool:** Indoor-outdoor. Atlas views from the water.
- **Address:** Route d'Amizmiz Km 27, Tamesloht
- **Web:** [kasbahdif.com](https://www.kasbahdif.com)

## Barcelona

### Mandarin Oriental Barcelona ★★★★★

Former bank HQ on Passeig de Gràcia, converted 2009. Patricia Urquiola interiors — Bisazza mosaics, custom furniture. This is design-hotel-meets-grand-hotel done right.

- **The food:** Restaurant Moments (1★ Michelin) — Carme Ruscalleda + son Raül Balam. Catalan poetry on a plate: langoustines au safran, riz de canard. Blanc by Chef Marc de Martín for tapas (croquetas, gambas, Maresme anchovies).

## Kelly's Concierge Notes

### Paris Power Move

- **Italian-modern:** Bvlgari. Romito's cooking, the pool, WhatsApp butler. For people bored of French palaces.
- **Old-world + Ducasse:** Le Meurice. Bar 228 before dinner, Le Dalí for lunch. Classic for a reason.
- **The flex:** Le Bristol. Rooftop pool (not basement!) + Suite Eden with private terrace spa. 100 years of knowing exactly what they're doing.

### Alps Cheat Sheet

- **Zen minimalists:** Aman Le Mélézin. Omakase after skiing, motoneige dinner, zero noise.
- **Design-forward families:** Rosewood Le Jardin Alpin. Brand new, Studio KO apartment, Trois Vallées access.
- **Intimate 2★ dining:** Le Strato. Baumanière 1850 is worth the trip alone.
- **Full palace experience:** Barrière Les Neiges. 310m² penthouse, hot-air balloon, Bernard Orsel on-site.

### Drive Times from Hossegor

| Destination | Drive | Fly                                      |
| ----------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Paris       | ~6h   | 1h to Orly/CDG                           |
| Courchevel  | ~8h   | Fly via Lyon or Chambéry                 |
| Barcelona   | ~4h30 | —                                        |
| Marrakech   | —     | Fly from Biarritz (seasonal) or Bordeaux |

### Booking Intel

- **Courchevel palaces** open ~4 months (Dec–Apr). Book 3–6 months ahead for peak weeks (Christmas, February school holidays, Russian New Year).
- **Paris palaces** year-round, but Fashion Week (Jan, Mar, Jun, Sep) + Roland-Garros (late May–early Jun) inflate rates significantly. Book around them or embrace the surcharge.
