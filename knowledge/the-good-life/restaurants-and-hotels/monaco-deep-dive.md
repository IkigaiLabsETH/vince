## Hotels

### Hôtel de Paris Monte-Carlo **[GK]**

SBM's flagship palace, right on Place du Casino. Completed a top-to-bottom renovation. Home to **Le Louis XV-Alain Ducasse** (3★ Michelin) and **Le Grill** rooftop (1★ Michelin, retractable roof). Connected to **Spa Metropole by Givenchy** next door. This is the ultimate Monaco address — if you're only staying one place, it's here.

### Hôtel Hermitage Monte-Carlo **[GK]**

Also SBM. Belle Époque architecture with a stunning winter garden designed by Gustave Eiffel. Houses **Le Vistamar** (1★ Michelin, seafood). Direct access to **Thermes Marins** seawater spa. Quieter and more romantic than the Hôtel de Paris — same ownership, different energy.

### Monte-Carlo Beach **[TGL]**

Renovated under Dorothée Delaye's direction. Dining includes **Sea Satin at Maona** (Mykonos-style beach restaurant), **Jondal**, and cuisine by Marcel Ravin. Home to **Elsa** (1★ Michelin, world's first 100% organic starred restaurant). Rates from €1,057+. The place where Monaco meets the sea properly.

### Fairmont Monte Carlo **[GK]**

596 rooms perched directly on the Grand Prix hairpin — the most famous corner in motorsport. **Nobu** and **Nikki Beach** on-site. Rates €289–469. The entry point to Monaco luxury, especially in low season. Book a hairpin-view suite for GP weekend two years ahead minimum.

### Maybourne Riviera **[GK]**

Technically Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, 10 minutes from Monaco. Jean-Michel Wilmotte design, cliff-perched with jaw-dropping Mediterranean views. Houses **Ceto** (1★ Michelin) — Mauro Colagreco's seafood-focused second table. The most architecturally striking hotel in the area.

### Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort **[GK]**

334 rooms, massive lagoon pool, **Las Brisas** beach club. The star is **Blue Bay** (Marcel Ravin, 2★ Michelin) — Caribbean-Mediterranean fusion that's unlike anything else on the Riviera. Also home to **Cipriani** for Italian. Resort feel in a city-state that doesn't really do resorts.

### Hôtel Metropole Monte-Carlo **[GK]**

Jacques Garcia interiors — dark, sumptuous, very Parisian. **Yoshi** (1★ Michelin, Japanese, Joël Robuchon legacy). The **Odyssey** pool area designed by Karl Lagerfeld. **Spa by Givenchy**. The most design-forward hotel in Monaco.

## Non-Starred Gems & Dining Experiences

- **Café de Paris** — Brasserie directly on Place du Casino. Not about the food — it's about the people-watching. An institution. **[GK]**
- **La Marée** — Seafood in the port area. Locals like it. **[GK]**
- **Cipriani** — Italian at Monte-Carlo Bay. Consistent Cipriani formula. **[GK]**
- **Nobu** — Inside the Fairmont. You know what you're getting. **[GK]**
- **Sea Satin at Maona** — Monte-Carlo Beach. Mykonos-style energy, seafood, dancing on tables by midnight. **[TGL]**
- **Song Qi** — Chinese fine dining near Monaco port. Sleek, serious, good. **[GK]**

## Key Experiences

### Casino de Monte-Carlo **[GK]**

The original. Dress code enforced (jacket after 14:00 in the gaming rooms). **Salle Europe** is the main floor — roulette, blackjack, accessible minimums. **Salons Privés** for high-rollers. Even if you don't gamble, walk through the atrium. It's worth the €17 entry alone.

### Grand Prix de Monaco **[GK]**

Late May. The race runs through the streets — you can literally touch the barriers. Best viewing: **Fairmont hairpin suites** (book 2+ years ahead), **Hôtel de Paris terrace**, or a **yacht in the port**. The most prestigious race on the calendar. Plan around it or avoid it entirely — there's no middle ground.

### Yacht Club de Monaco **[GK]**

Norman Foster-designed building on the port. Members-only but hosts public events and regattas. Worth seeing architecturally even from outside.

### Musée Océanographique **[GK]**

Cliff-edge aquarium built in 1910. Jacques Cousteau directed it for decades. The rooftop terrace view alone justifies the visit.

### Monte-Carlo Opera — Salle Garnier **[GK]**

Designed by Charles Garnier — same architect as the Paris Opéra. Intimate, 524 seats, absurdly ornate. Check the season schedule; performances sell out.

### Thermes Marins **[GK]**

Seawater therapy spa connected to both the Hermitage and Hôtel de Paris via underground passage. Pools, treatments, recovery. The serious wellness option in Monaco.

### Shopping **[GK]**

**Carré d'Or** — the luxury grid around the Casino. **Avenue Princesse Grace** for flagships. **One Monte-Carlo** — the new luxury retail destination by SBM, anchored around Place du Casino.

### F.P. Journe Manufacture **[TGL]**

Independent watchmaker François-Paul Journe's manufacture is in Monaco. Tours possible by arrangement. If you care about horology, this is a pilgrimage.

## Practical

- **Getting there**: Nice Côte d'Azur airport → 30 min by car. Or **Monacair helicopter** → 7 minutes, ~€160 one-way. The helicopter is not a flex — it's genuinely the smart move when traffic is bad. **[GK]**
- **Parking**: Extremely limited on the street. Use hotel valet. Underground public parking exists but fills fast during events. **[GK]**
- **Dress code culture**: Smart casual is the bare minimum everywhere in Monaco. Jacket required at Le Louis XV and the Casino gaming rooms. Nobody will say anything if you're in shorts at the port, but you'll feel it. **[GK]**
- **Best times to visit**: GP weekend (late May), Monaco Yacht Show (late Sep), Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters tennis (Apr). Low season (Nov–Feb) for value and calm. **[GK]**

## Kelly's Playbook

### The Blow-Out

Hôtel de Paris → Le Louis XV dinner → Casino de Monte-Carlo → nightcap at the hotel bar → repeat tomorrow. This is the Monaco greatest-hits package. No thinking required.

### The Romantic

Maybourne Riviera → sunset dinner at Ceto → drinks at Bar 300 overlooking the coast. Away from the Casino crowds. Intimate, architecturally stunning, quiet.

### The Petrolhead

Fairmont Monte Carlo GP suite → watch the race from the hairpin → Nobu dinner. Only works race weekend, and you need to book the suite years out. Worth every euro.

### The Foodie Circuit

Day 1: Mirazur lunch (Menton, 15 min). Day 1 evening: Ceto dinner. Day 2: Blue Bay lunch. Day 2 evening: Elsa for clean eating. Four starred meals in 48 hours across three different culinary philosophies.

### The Wellness

Monte-Carlo Beach → morning at Thermes Marins → Elsa organic lunch. Reset mode. Monaco does wellness better than people expect.

### Smart Value

Fairmont in low season starts at €289. That's a 4-star on the GP hairpin for less than a mid-range Paris hotel. It's the entry point to Monaco luxury — and Nobu's right downstairs.
