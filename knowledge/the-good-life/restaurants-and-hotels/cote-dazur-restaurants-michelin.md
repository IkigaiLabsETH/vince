## ⭐⭐⭐ Three Michelin Stars

### Menton

**Mirazur**
Chef Mauro Colagreco · Garden-to-table · €€€€
Perched above Menton with panoramic views over the bay and Colagreco's own gardens. #1 on the World's 50 Best 2019. The tasting menu shifts with lunar cycles — expect produce picked hours before service. Book 2–3 months ahead minimum; lunch is slightly easier to land than dinner.

### Monaco

**Le Louis XV – Alain Ducasse**
Chef Alain Ducasse (exec), Hôtel de Paris · Mediterranean haute · €€€€
The restaurant that proved Riviera cuisine deserved three stars — holding them since 1990. Opulent Belle Époque room, impeccable wine program (one of the deepest cellars in Europe). Jacket required. Reserve 6–8 weeks out; concierge channels help.

### Saint-Tropez

**La Vague d'Or**
Chef Arnaud Donckele (prior to Paris move), Cheval Blanc · Provençal haute cuisine · €€€€
Inside the Cheval Blanc on the Presqu'île de Saint-Tropez. Donckele's sauces are legendary — layered, slow-built, deeply Provençal. Seasonal closure (typically Nov–Mar). Book with the hotel for best availability.

### Mougins

**Paloma**
Chef Nicolas Decherchi · Contemporary Mediterranean · €€€–€€€€
Elegant hilltop setting in the village that once drew Picasso. Decherchi's cooking is precise, seasonal, ingredient-driven. Strong local wine list. Easier to book midweek.

### Nice

**Virginie Basselot** at Le Negresco

Chef Yoric Tièche · Four Seasons Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat · Garden-to-table · €€€–€€€€
