# NFT Collection Tier System

This document explains our personal tier system for evaluating NFT collections. This is subjective and based on our collecting philosophy.

## Tier 1: Blue Chip (💎)

**Characteristics:**

- Battle-tested through multiple market cycles
- Institutional interest and collector demand
- High liquidity (thick floors)
- Historical significance in the space
- Unlikely to go to zero

**Examples:**

- CryptoPunks - The OG, launched 2017
- Autoglyphs - First on-chain generative art
- Chromie Squiggle - Art Blocks genesis, the signature of the platform
- Fidenza - Tyler Hobbs masterpiece, peak generative art
- Ringers - Dmitri Cherniak's iconic Art Blocks piece

**Our Approach:**

- Core of our collection (60%+)
- Buy on weakness, never chase
- Hold indefinitely
- Only sell for life-changing opportunities

## Tier 2: Established (🥈)

**Characteristics:**

- Proven artists with consistent market
- Strong communities
- Survived at least one cycle
- Regular secondary sales

**Examples:**

- XCOPY 1/1s and editions
- Pak (various projects)
- Other Art Blocks Curated pieces
- SuperRare top artists
- Foundation established names

**Our Approach:**

- 25% of collection
- Buy from artists we genuinely appreciate
- May trade between pieces
- Hold through volatility if conviction is high

## Tier 3: Emerging (🥉)

**Characteristics:**

- Promising artists showing growth
- Growing recognition but not proven
- Could become Tier 2 or fade
- Often good entry points exist

**Examples:**

- New Art Blocks Factory drops
- Up-and-coming SuperRare artists
- Photography collections with potential
- Gen-art artists before major recognition

**Our Approach:**

- ~10% of collection
- Higher conviction required per piece
- Willing to take more risk for potential upside
- Exit if thesis breaks down

## Tier 4: Speculative (🔹)

**Characteristics:**

- New projects, unproven
- High risk, high potential reward
- Often pre-reveal or new drops
- Requires active monitoring

**Examples:**

- New drops from unknown teams
- Speculative mints
- Experimental projects
- Very early stage artists

**Our Approach:**

- ~5% of collection maximum
- Small positions only
- Quick to exit if not working
- Treat as lottery tickets, not investments

## Floor Thickness by Tier

| Tier | Typical Floor Thickness    | Liquidity   |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | Very Thick (100+ at floor) | High        |
| 2    | Thick (20-100 at floor)    | Medium-High |
| 3    | Variable (5-50)            | Medium      |
| 4    | Often Thin (<10)           | Low         |

## Movement Between Tiers

Collections can move between tiers:

**Upgrading:**

- Tier 3 → Tier 2: Artist gains recognition, survives cycle
- Tier 2 → Tier 1: Becomes historically significant (rare)

**Downgrading:**

- Tier 2 → Tier 3: Community dies, artist inactive
- Tier 3 → Tier 4: Project abandonment, drama
- Tier 4 → Rug: Team exits, art worthless

## Red Flags

Watch for these signals that a collection might decline:

- Artist goes silent or exits space
- Core community members selling
- Volume drops to near-zero
- Floor erodes continuously with few buyers
- Team drama or controversy

## Our Conviction Test

Before adding any piece:

1. Would I display this in my home?
2. Does this artist/project have staying power?
3. Is the floor thickness acceptable for my position size?
4. Am I buying at a reasonable price or chasing?
5. Does this fit my portfolio allocation by tier?
