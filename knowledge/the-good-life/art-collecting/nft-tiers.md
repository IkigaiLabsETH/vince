> 
> This essay contains **historical examples and illustrative data** from when it was written.
> - **Numbers, prices, and metrics are OUTDATED** - they illustrate concepts, not current conditions
> - **Focus: Methodology and frameworks** - learn HOW TO THINK about topics, not what the numbers were
> - **Use for:** Analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic thinking
> - **Do NOT use for:** Current prices, up-to-date metrics, real-time data

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Battle-tested through multiple market cycles
- Institutional interest and collector demand
- High liquidity (thick floors)
- Historical significance in the space
- Unlikely to go to zero

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs


# NFT Collection Tier System

This document explains our personal tier system for evaluating NFT collections. This is subjective and based on our collecting philosophy.

## Tier 1: Blue Chip (💎)

**Characteristics:**
- Battle-tested through multiple market cycles
- Institutional interest and collector demand
- High liquidity (thick floors)
- Historical significance in the space
- Unlikely to go to zero

**Examples:**
- CryptoPunks - The OG, launched 2017
- Autoglyphs - First on-chain generative art
- Chromie Squiggle - Art Blocks genesis, the signature of the platform
- Fidenza - Tyler Hobbs masterpiece, peak generative art
- Ringers - Dmitri Cherniak's iconic Art Blocks piece

**Our Approach:**
- Core of our collection (60%+)
- Buy on weakness, never chase
- Hold indefinitely
- Only sell for life-changing opportunities

## Tier 2: Established (🥈)

**Characteristics:**
- Proven artists with consistent market
- Strong communities
- Survived at least one cycle
- Regular secondary sales

**Examples:**
- XCOPY 1/1s and editions
- Pak (various projects)
- Other Art Blocks Curated pieces
- SuperRare top artists
- Foundation established names

**Our Approach:**
- 25% of collection
- Buy from artists we genuinely appreciate
- May trade between pieces
- Hold through volatility if conviction is high

## Tier 3: Emerging (🥉)

**Characteristics:**
- Promising artists showing growth
- Growing recognition but not proven
- Could become Tier 2 or fade
- Often good entry points exist

**Examples:**
- New Art Blocks Factory drops
- Up-and-coming SuperRare artists
- Photography collections with potential
- Gen-art artists before major recognition

**Our Approach:**
- ~10% of collection
- Higher conviction required per piece
- Willing to take more risk for potential upside
- Exit if thesis breaks down

## Tier 4: Speculative (🔹)

**Characteristics:**
- New projects, unproven
- High risk, high potential reward
- Often pre-reveal or new drops
- Requires active monitoring

**Examples:**
- New drops from unknown teams
- Speculative mints
- Experimental projects
- Very early stage artists

**Our Approach:**
- ~5% of collection maximum
- Small positions only
- Quick to exit if not working
- Treat as lottery tickets, not investments

## Floor Thickness by Tier

| Tier | Typical Floor Thickness | Liquidity |
|------|------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Very Thick (100+ at floor) | High |
| 2 | Thick (20-100 at floor) | Medium-High |
| 3 | Variable (5-50) | Medium |
| 4 | Often Thin (<10) | Low |

## Movement Between Tiers

Collections can move between tiers:

**Upgrading:**
- Tier 3 → Tier 2: Artist gains recognition, survives cycle
- Tier 2 → Tier 1: Becomes historically significant (rare)

**Downgrading:**
- Tier 2 → Tier 3: Community dies, artist inactive
- Tier 3 → Tier 4: Project abandonment, drama
- Tier 4 → Rug: Team exits, art worthless

## Red Flags

Watch for these signals that a collection might decline:
- Artist goes silent or exits space
- Core community members selling
- Volume drops to near-zero
- Floor erodes continuously with few buyers
- Team drama or controversy

## Our Conviction Test

Before adding any piece:
1. Would I display this in my home?
2. Does this artist/project have staying power?
3. Is the floor thickness acceptable for my position size?
4. Am I buying at a reasonable price or chasing?
5. Does this fit my portfolio allocation by tier?
