## Red Flags to Monitor

When evaluating emerging artists, watch for:

1. **Oversupply**: Artist releasing too frequently
2. **Style Drift**: Changing aesthetic radically
3. **Hype Over Substance**: More marketing than art
4. **No Community**: Silence between drops
5. **Price Decline**: Consistent secondary weakness
