# Physical Art Collecting

This document covers our approach to physical art, separate from but complementary to our NFT collection.

> **📌 Knowledge Base Note**
> 
> This essay contains **historical examples and illustrative data** from when it was written.
> - **Numbers, prices, and metrics are OUTDATED** - they illustrate concepts, not current conditions
> - **Focus: Methodology and frameworks** - learn HOW TO THINK about topics, not what the numbers were
> - **Use for:** Analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic thinking
> - **Do NOT use for:** Current prices, up-to-date metrics, real-time data
> 
> **What this provides:** Thinking frameworks, methodologies, analytical approaches
> **What this does NOT provide:** Current market data (use actions/APIs instead)

## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **Tangible presence** in our home
- **Aesthetic impact** on daily living
- **No liquidity concerns** - we buy to keep
- **Different valuation** - personal joy over investment returns
- Fine art photography with emotional resonance

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs


## Philosophy

Physical art occupies a different space in our lives:

- **Tangible presence** in our home
- **Aesthetic impact** on daily living
- **No liquidity concerns** - we buy to keep
- **Different valuation** - personal joy over investment returns

## Categories We Collect

### Photography (Primary Focus)

Photography is our personal passion:

**What we look for:**
- Fine art photography with emotional resonance
- Limited editions with certificates
- Archival printing (museum quality)
- Artists whose vision aligns with ours

**Sources:**
- Galleries specializing in photography
- Direct from artists we follow
- Auction houses for established photographers

**Notable Interests:**
- Landscape and architectural photography
- Documentary/street photography
- Abstract and experimental work
- Contemporary photographers with growing recognition

### Contemporary Art

Beyond photography:

**What appeals to us:**
- Work that fits our living space
- Pieces that inspire or provoke thought
- Artists with authentic vision
- Mix of emerging and established

**What we avoid:**
- Art as pure investment (speculation)
- Pieces that don't resonate personally
- Trends we don't genuinely appreciate

---

## Acquisition Approach

### Discovery

**How we find pieces:**
1. Gallery exhibitions and openings
2. Art fairs (Basel, Frieze, etc.)
3. Online galleries (Artsy, galleries' sites)
4. Artist studio visits when possible
5. Referrals from trusted collectors

### Due Diligence

**Before purchasing:**
1. Research the artist's background and trajectory
2. Verify authenticity and provenance
3. Understand edition sizes and printing details
4. Compare to market prices if applicable
5. Consider framing and display costs

### Budget Allocation

**Our approach:**
- Set annual art budget (separate from NFTs)
- Priority: Photography > Contemporary > Other
- Mix of price points (accessible + investment pieces)
- Room in budget for spontaneous finds

---

## Care & Display

### Preservation

**Best practices:**
- Proper framing with UV-protective glass
- Climate control in display areas
- Away from direct sunlight
- Insurance for valuable pieces
- Documentation of all pieces

### Display Philosophy

**Guiding principles:**
- Art should be seen, not stored
- Rotate pieces to keep space fresh
- Group by theme or let pieces stand alone
- Lighting matters (proper art lighting)
- Consider art in room design

---

## Physical-Digital Bridge

Some artists bridge physical and digital:

**NFT + Physical:**
- Some NFT purchases include physical prints
- Some artists offer NFT holders physical editions
- Redeemable NFTs for physical works

**Our approach:**
- Love when both options exist
- Physical adds to the experience
- Not a requirement, but a bonus

---

## Building the Collection

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Focus on photography we love
- Build relationship with key galleries
- 1-2 significant pieces per year
- Emerging artists with potential

### Phase 2: Growth
- Expand to established photographers
- Add contemporary pieces that complement
- More intentional curation
- Possible focus areas emerging

### Phase 3: Maturity
- Collection tells a coherent story
- Mix of accessible and significant pieces
- Regular rotation of display
- Possibly loan pieces to exhibitions

---

## Tracking Physical Art

Unlike NFTs, physical art requires different tracking:

**What to record:**
- Artist name and title
- Date acquired, purchase price
- Provenance and certificates
- Edition information
- Location in home
- Insurance value
- Condition notes

---

## Connection to Lifestyle Coordinator

The lifestyle-coordinator can help track:
- Physical art acquisitions
- Framing and display projects
- Gallery visits and exhibitions
- Art budget status

This integrates with the renovation tracking (art gallery area of the home).
