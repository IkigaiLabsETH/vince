# Art Collecting Knowledge Base

This directory contains the personal art collecting philosophy, strategy, and reference material for MARGAUX's lifestyle coordination.

## Philosophy

Art collecting for us is a **passion first, investment second**. We collect:

1. **What we genuinely love** - Pieces that speak to us aesthetically and emotionally
2. **Blue chips for the core** - Established collections with proven staying power
3. **Photography as a passion** - Beyond the investment thesis, photography is close to our hearts
4. **Generative art appreciation** - Art Blocks and on-chain generative art represent the intersection of code and creativity

## The Three-Layer Approach

### Layer 1: Blue Chip Foundation (60%+)
Core holdings in battle-tested collections:
- CryptoPunks
- Autoglyphs
- Art Blocks Curated (Squiggles, Fidenza, Ringers)
- Historical 1/1s from established artists

### Layer 2: Established Artists (25%)
Proven artists with consistent demand:
- XCOPY
- Pak
- Tyler Hobbs (beyond Fidenza)
- Art Blocks Factory quality pieces

### Layer 3: Emerging & Speculative (15%)
Higher risk, higher potential:
- Promising new artists
- Pre-reveal drops from quality teams
- Photography and physical art

## Collecting Principles

1. **Buy what you love, not what you think will pump**
2. **Blue chips over speculation for core holdings**
3. **Floor thickness > raw floor price** (important!)
4. **Accumulate during bear markets**
5. **Never chase pumps - wait for cool-offs**
6. **Photography is our passion beyond investment**

## Floor Thickness Analysis

Before any purchase, we analyze floor thickness:
- 🟢 **Thick floor**: Many listings at/near floor - safer to buy
- 🔴 **Thin floor**: Few listings - price can swing wildly
- The artcollector agent specializes in this analysis

## Connection to artcollector Agent

The `artcollector` agent (located at `src/agents/artcollector.ts`) contains:
- Deep knowledge of 420+ collections organized by tier
- Floor thickness analysis capabilities
- Whale tracking intelligence
- Gem detection algorithms

This knowledge base provides the **philosophy and strategy**, while artcollector provides the **market intelligence**.
