## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- 50+ listings within 10% of floor
- Regular daily sales
- Multiple buyers active
- <10 listings near floor
- Infrequent sales

**Analytical Approach:**
- Apply these frameworks to interpret current market conditions
- Focus on the thinking patterns, not specific numbers
- Use as foundation for your own analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Historical examples illustrate concepts, not predict outcomes
- Look for similar patterns in current data using your tools
- Combine with real-time data from actions/APIs


# Art Collecting Strategy

This document outlines our tactical approach to building and managing an art collection.

## Core Philosophy

**"Collect what you love, verify it makes sense."**

We are collectors first, speculators last. The pieces we acquire should bring us joy independent of their monetary value. However, we apply rigorous analysis before purchasing.

## Acquisition Framework

### Step 1: Discovery & Research

When a piece catches our attention:

1. **Aesthetic Check**: Does this genuinely appeal to me?
2. **Artist Research**: Who is the artist? What's their history?
3. **Collection Analysis**: How does this fit in the broader collection?
4. **Market Check**: What's the floor, volume, and trend?

### Step 2: Floor Thickness Analysis

Before any purchase, analyze the floor:

```
Thick Floor (Safe):
- 50+ listings within 10% of floor
- Regular daily sales
- Multiple buyers active

Thin Floor (Caution):
- <10 listings near floor
- Infrequent sales
- Few active buyers
```

**Rule**: Never buy thin-floor pieces in size you can't hold forever.

### Step 3: Position Sizing

Based on tier and conviction:

| Tier | Max Position | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | 20% of art portfolio | Core holdings |
| 2 | 10% per piece | Established |
| 3 | 5% per piece | Emerging |
| 4 | 2% per piece | Speculative |

### Step 4: Entry Timing

**Best Times to Buy:**
- Bear market capitulation (60-80% from highs)
- After drama-induced flash crashes
- When sentiment is max negative
- Collection-specific weakness (artist hiatus, etc.)

**Worst Times to Buy:**
- During pumps
- FOMO after seeing others' gains
- When floor is setting new highs
- Pre-reveal with high expectations

### Step 5: Execution

1. Set bid below current floor (5-15% under)
2. Wait for organic fills
3. If urgent, buy at ask but verify floor thickness first
4. Always use reputable marketplaces

## Portfolio Rebalancing

### Quarterly Review

Every quarter, assess:
- Total portfolio value vs. last quarter
- Tier allocation drift
- Underperforming pieces
- New opportunities

### Selling Framework

Consider selling when:
- Piece has 5x+ and you've lost conviction
- Artist/project showing red flags
- Better opportunity requires capital
- Tier 4 piece hasn't moved in 12+ months

**Never sell:**
- Blue chips unless life-changing money
- Pieces you genuinely love
- During panic unless thesis is broken
- To chase another pump

## Market Cycle Strategy

### Bull Market
- Trim speculative positions
- Take profits on 10x+ plays
- Maintain blue chip core
- Avoid FOMO

### Bear Market
- Aggressive accumulation mode
- Focus on Tier 1-2
- Bid low, be patient
- Strengthen conviction holdings

### Sideways Market
- Selective additions only
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Use time to research
- Build watchlist

## Risk Management

### Diversification
- No single piece >20% of art portfolio
- No single artist >30% (except blue chips)
- Mix of NFT + physical (if applicable)
- Some pieces for pure love, some for investment

### Red Lines
- Never: Put rent/food money into art
- Never: Borrow against art for more art
- Never: Over-concentrate in new projects
- Never: Ignore red flags for hopium

## Tracking & Tools

### What to Track
- Purchase price and date
- Current floor price
- Floor thickness score
- Conviction level (1-5)
- Reasoning for purchase

### Regular Checks
- Daily: Quick floor check on core holdings
- Weekly: Review watchlist opportunities
- Monthly: Portfolio allocation review
- Quarterly: Full strategy assessment
