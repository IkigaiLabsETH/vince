## Methodology and Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- Hotel selection is a multi-factor optimization, not just price or stars
- Different occasions call for different hotel types
- Off-season timing dramatically improves value
- 1-night stays maximize experience density

**Analytical Approach:**
- Think of hotels as experience multipliers, not just accommodation
- Match hotel strengths to your specific goals for the trip
- Time visits to off-season for best value/quality ratio
- Consider the full 24-hour experience, not just the room

**Decision Framework:**

1. **What's the occasion?** (Purpose selection)
   - Gastronomy focus → Prioritize starred restaurant on-site
   - Relaxation focus → Prioritize spa, setting, quiet
   - Romance/special → Prioritize ambiance, views, exclusivity
   - Work/productivity → Prioritize comfort, WiFi, quiet
   
2. **What's the setting?** (Environment match)
   - Ocean drama → Beachfront palace/resort
   - Wine immersion → Vineyard hotel
   - Countryside peace → Rural estate
   - Urban culture → City boutique/palace

3. **What's the timing?** (Season optimization)
   - Off-season (Nov-Mar): 40-50% discount, quieter, best staff attention
   - Shoulder (Apr-May, Oct): Moderate pricing, good weather
   - Peak (Jul-Aug, holidays): Avoid unless necessary

4. **What's the day?** (Day optimization)
   - Wednesday/Thursday: Best midweek rates
   - Sunday: Often discounted
   - Friday/Saturday: Premium pricing

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Palace hotels often close Jan-Feb (winter closures)
- Harvest season (Sep-Oct) = premium in wine regions
- 1-night stay should be: arrive for lunch, spa/activity, dinner, overnight, late checkout
- Direct booking often beats OTAs for luxury properties

**Red Flags:**
- Hotel without on-site restaurant (limits experience density)
- Only pool photos (hiding dated rooms)
- "Recently renovated" without completion date
- No winter closure (may indicate cutting corners)

**Important Notes:**
- Star ratings are relative - 5* in regions varies
- Palace designation (France) is meaningful; 5* luxury elsewhere less so
- Focus on the experience framework, not specific prices

# Hotel Selection Framework

## Context

Hotel selection is often done poorly - people optimize for price, or stars, or location, without considering the full picture. The right framework considers:
1. What you're trying to accomplish
2. What the hotel excels at
3. How to time it for maximum value

This is especially true for luxury hotels where the difference between a mediocre and exceptional experience can be enormous despite similar pricing.

## Core Framework: The Occasion-Match Method

### Step 1: Define Your Primary Goal

| Goal | What You Need | Hotel Type |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Gastronomy** | Starred restaurant, sommelier | Gastronomic hotel (Les Prés d'Eugénie style) |
| **Relaxation** | Spa, quiet setting, no crowds | Countryside estate or wellness resort |
| **Romance** | Privacy, views, exceptional service | Boutique palace or secluded luxury |
| **Celebration** | Wow factor, space for group | Grand palace or château |
| **Productivity** | Quiet, good workspace, reliable internet | Business boutique or small luxury |

### Step 2: Match the Setting

| Setting | Best For | Trade-offs |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Beachfront** | Drama, sunsets, water activities | Can be windy, crowded in season |
| **Vineyard** | Wine immersion, peaceful, tastings | Remote, limited evening options |
| **Countryside** | Quiet, nature, wellness | Need car, fewer dining options |
| **City** | Culture, dining variety, walkability | Noise, less exclusive feel |
| **Mountain** | Views, hiking, ski | Seasonal, weather dependent |

### Step 3: Optimize Timing

**Off-Season Strategy (Our Preference):**
```
Peak pricing: ~800-1200 EUR/night
Off-season pricing: ~400-600 EUR/night
Savings: 40-50%

Plus: Quieter, better service, available reservations
Minus: Some facilities may be closed, weather less reliable
```

**Day of Week Optimization:**
```
Best rates: Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday
Worst rates: Friday, Saturday (unless business hotel)
```

**1-Night Stay Maximization:**
```
13:00 - Arrive, lunch at hotel restaurant
15:00 - Spa treatment or local activity
19:30 - Pre-dinner drinks
20:00 - Main dinner (tasting menu if starred)
10:00 - Breakfast (don't skip!)
12:00 - Late checkout, explore grounds
13:00 - Depart

Total experience time: 24 hours
Value extracted: Lunch, spa, dinner, breakfast, sleep, grounds
```

## Application: Hotel Category Selection

### For Gastronomy Trips

**Prioritize (in order):**
1. On-site starred restaurant (3* > 2* > 1*)
2. Quality of wine program
3. Multiple dining options (formal + casual)
4. Kitchen garden or local sourcing philosophy

**De-prioritize:**
- Pool/beach (you're here to eat)
- Gym (unnecessary)
- Room size (you'll be in restaurant)

### For Relaxation/Wellness Trips

**Prioritize (in order):**
1. Spa quality and treatment options
2. Setting and views
3. Quiet/seclusion
4. Comfortable bed and room

**De-prioritize:**
- Restaurant stars (good enough is fine)
- Location convenience (you're staying put)
- Activities/excursions (you're resting)

### For Special Occasions

**Prioritize (in order):**
1. Wow factor / Instagram moments
2. Exceptional service
3. Room upgrade potential
4. Celebration-friendly (cake, champagne, etc.)

**De-prioritize:**
- Value optimization (it's a splurge)
- Practicality (it's about the experience)

## Signals and Patterns

**Quality signals:**
- Palace designation (France) or equivalent recognition
- Relais & Châteaux membership (food focus)
- Michelin-starred restaurant on-site
- Small number of rooms (attention to detail)
- Family-owned for multiple generations

**Value signals:**
- Direct booking often includes extras
- Off-season rates 40-50% below peak
- Midweek rates 20-30% below weekend
- Package deals (dinner included)

**Red flag signals:**
- Endless renovations
- Management changes
- Michelin demotion
- Poor reviews mentioning attitude (not just issues)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Optimizing only for price**
   - Fix: Calculate experience-per-euro, not room-per-euro

2. **Ignoring timing**
   - Fix: Same hotel, 50% less in off-season

3. **Booking too many nights**
   - Fix: 1-2 nights at exceptional > 5 nights at mediocre

4. **Skipping hotel restaurant**
   - Fix: The restaurant often IS the reason to stay

5. **Arriving late, leaving early**
   - Fix: Arrive for lunch, leave after late checkout

6. **Not booking direct**
   - Fix: Luxury hotels often match OTAs + give extras

## Conclusion

- Hotel selection is goal-first, not price-first
- Match hotel strengths to your specific purpose
- Off-season timing is the biggest value lever
- 1-night stays should be experience-dense
- Quality signals matter more than star counts
