# Michelin Restaurants Knowledge Base

This knowledge base contains curated information about Michelin-starred restaurants in France. Focus is on exceptional dining experiences that align with the "good life" philosophy.

## Star System

- **3 Stars**: Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey
- **2 Stars**: Excellent cooking, worth a detour
- **1 Star**: High quality cooking, worth a stop
- **Bib Gourmand**: Good quality, good value cooking

## Regions Covered

- **Paris**: France's gastronomic capital
- **Southwest France (complete starred list)**: southwest-france-michelin-stars-complete.md (every 1/2/3-star in Nouvelle-Aquitaine)
- **Bordeaux Region**: Wine country dining
- **La Rochelle**: Atlantic coast, seafood (e.g. Christopher Coutanceau)
- **Biarritz & Basque Country**: Atlantic coast and Basque cuisine
- **Cross-region highlights**: Notable destinations worth travel

## Dining Philosophy

Michelin dining is tracked alongside:
- Hotel escapes (gastronomic weekends)
- Roadtrip planning (culinary destinations)
- Wine region exploration (wine + food pairing)
- Special occasions and celebrations

## Wishlist System

Restaurants are tracked in three categories:
- **Wishlist**: Places to experience
- **Visited**: Past meals with ratings and notes
- **Favorites**: Exceptional experiences worth revisiting

## How to add new lunch spots from the Michelin Guide

In Discord, post a Michelin Guide link in the **#knowledge** channel and Eliza will try to add that restaurant to this knowledge base.

1. **Spot**: Find the place on [guide.michelin.com](https://guide.michelin.com) (France → Nouvelle-Aquitaine → city/region). Note name, address, phone, price (€/€€/€€€), style, opening hours if shown, and the Guide URL.
2. **Decide where it belongs**:
   - **Landes** (Rion-des-Landes, Magescq, Garrosse, Uza, etc.) and you want it in "open today" suggestions → You need opening days/hours. Add to `curated-open-schedule.md` under the correct days, and add a short entry to `landes-locals.md` and `michelin-restaurants/landes-locals.md` with address, phone, open days.
   - **Elsewhere in SW France** (e.g. Bayonne, Biarritz, Bordeaux) → Add as a **wishlist** entry in the right regional file. Kelly will use it for "lunch in Bayonne" and similar.
3. **Add the entry**:
   - **Landes**: In `curated-open-schedule.md` add a line under each day the place is open; in `landes-locals.md` add one line with open days; in `michelin-restaurants/landes-locals.md` add a table row and a short block (Regular Go-To, Domaine d'Uza, or Special Occasion).
   - **Other SW France**: In the regional file (e.g. `biarritz-region.md`, `bordeaux-region.md`) under the right city, add a block with **Address**, **MICHELIN** (link), **Phone**, **Price**, **Style**, **Chef** (if known), **Notes**. Optionally add a line to `southwest-france-michelin-stars-complete.md` if the place has a star or Bib.

2. **Lunch Value**: Many starred restaurants offer better-value lunch menus
3. **Seasonal Visits**: Spring and fall often feature best ingredients
4. **Wine Pairing**: Consider sommelier pairings for full experience
5. **Dietary Needs**: Communicate restrictions well in advance
