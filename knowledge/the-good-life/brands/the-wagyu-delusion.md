---I blame the Big Green Egg. Fifteen years ago, spending $1,200 on a ceramic kamado painted the color of a 1970s refrigerator made you a neighborhood eccentric. Today those same green orbs sit in perfect rows across suburban America like Easter Island statues dedicated to the god of reverse-sear. The Egg didn’t just sell grills; it sold anxiety. Once you dropped a grand on cookware, the meat had to justify the altar. Costco Prime suddenly felt déclassé. You needed something with a certificate, a story, a marble score that looked like a Jackson Pollock painting made of fat.

Enter Japanese A5 Wagyu: the perfect high priest for the new religion.

It is not “the best beef in the world.” It is the winner of a 150-year Japanese carcass competition that literally penalizes leanness and rewards animals so obese they sometimes need help standing up. The cows are confined, grain-finished for 600+ days, and pumped full of calories until their intramuscular fat hits levels that would embarrass a goose headed for foie gras. The result is surreal—meat that melts below body temperature, tastes like warm wagyu tallow with a whisper of beef, and costs more per gram than most cocaine.

Four bites in, most honest humans hit the same wall: “This is incredible… can I have some water and maybe a plain hamburger now?”

Meanwhile, in the windswept Pampas, purebred Black Angus still walk twenty miles a day on nothing but grass and attitude. Their fat is mostly external—easy to trim or render into potatoes that will ruin all future potatoes for you. The meat tastes like thunderstorm and iron and the color green somehow made edible. A 45-day wet-aged Argentine ribeye or bife de chorizo has more complexity in one bite than an entire A5 striploin.

And the price difference is obscene. You can land a 22-ounce, bone-in, grass-fed Argentine entrecot at your door for what one Tokyo steakhouse charges for 100 grams of the marbled stuff. You will finish the entire Argentine steak. You will not need a defibrillator afterward.

Real Japanese A5 deserves to exist, the same way a Lamborghini Countach deserves to exist. Try it once in situ, the way you should try white truffles or a helicopter ride over Manhattan. But declaring it the daily steak is like declaring 82% cacao single-origin chocolate the only legitimate way to eat a brownie.

Great steak doesn’t need a passport, a BMS score, or a $1,200 grill. It just needs fire, salt, and honesty.

**When the Fire Is Perfect: The Bordeaux Lineup**

When that grass-fed bife comes off the parrilla with a crust the color of mahogany and a center the temperature of a summer night in Buenos Aires, you do not reach for the $12 Malbec you drink with choripán on plastic chairs. You reach for something that can stare down the smoke.

Left Bank Bordeaux was born for this moment.

Saint-Julien (the sweet spot)

- 2016 Château Léoville-Barton
  Cassis, graphite, cold cigar box, and an iron backbone that makes the mineral edge of grass-fed beef stand up and sing. My forever choice.

- 2016 Château Ducru-Beaucaillou
  Silkier, almost dangerously seductive, yet still with enough tannic grip to refresh the palate between massive bites.

Saint-Estèphe (when you want smoke to meet smoke)

- 2016 Château Montrose
  Pure seawater and iron. One of the most “carnivorous” red wines on earth.

- 2016 Château Cos d’Estournel
  Black fruit, incense, and exotic spice that dance with quebracho coals like they were separated at birth.

Pauillac (the heavyweight division)

- 2016 Château Pichon-Longueville Comtesse de Lalande
  The cashmere hammer. Perfume for days, then a tidal wave of flavor that somehow never bullies the beef.

- 2010 or 2016 Château Grand-Puy-Lacoste
  Classic pencil-lead Pauillac that drinks like it costs twice as much.

Margaux (only one, because most Margaux is too delicate for hardcore asado)

- 2016 Château Palmer
  The lone Margaux with enough muscle and dark fruit to stand on the same stage as a one-kilogram bife de chorizo.

Any of these bottles, given two hours in a decanter, will make a $35 piece of Argentine grass-fed Angus taste like the most profound thing you’ve eaten all year. So let the Green Egg cult keep their scented candles disguised as steak. I’ll be in the backyard, coals glowing, a thick entrecot resting on a wooden board, coarse salt falling like the first snow of winter, and a glass of 2016 Léoville-Barton turning the night air purple.

That, my friends, is honesty on a plate.
Everything else is just marbling.

However, there’s a reason every serious asador in Argentina laughs at the idea of cooking a 1.2 kg bife de chorizo in 4 minutes over screaming-hot coals. Start with a mountain of aged oak or quebracho pushed to one side, let it collapse into a deep bed of low embers, throw in a fistful of dried grapevines from last year’s pruning for that quick aromatic hit, then cook the steak 20–30 cm above the heat for 25–40 minutes, flipping every 5–7 minutes until the internal temp creeps to 54–55 °C. The fat renders slowly, bastes the lean, the smoke penetrates, and the crust builds in layers instead of one violent char.

That kind of gradient (crispy exterior, rosy medium-rare edge-to-edge, molten fat cap) is physically impossible on a traditional open gaucho fire with logs blazing like a bonfire. You either get perfect crust + grey center or perfect center + no crust.

And here’s where the hated Green Egg quietly wins the argument it never asked for: It is literally the only consumer grill that can hold 110–130 °C steady for an hour while still giving you real wood smoke, because the ceramic and the airtight gasket cheat physics in a way no kettle, no offset barrel, and certainly no $10,000 Argentine parrilla with a wheel crank can match. Set it, forget it, drink some fine french wine with your friends instead of babysitting the fire. When the thermometer hits 52 °C pull it, rest it 10 minutes, and you have Michelin-level temperature control with backyard simplicity.

The Big Green Egg isn’t the problem. The problem is what people do with it: treat it like an Instagram stage for $300/oz Wagyu seared for 45 seconds per side while they film Reels in 4K.

Use the Egg the way you used your rusty old barrel: load it with proper oak and a handful of old grapevine, run it low and slow like a proper indirect parrilla, and put a $35 piece of grass-fed Argentine Angus on it for 45 minutes.

You’ll get the same result you got on that legendary rusty grill, only without having to add wood every eight minutes or move the meat around like a chess piece. The Egg isn’t the enemy of soul. Wagyu cooked for clout is.

Fire is still king.
But if the tool lets you nail perfect slow-rendered, smoke-kissed, grass-fed perfection every single time without standing there like a coal-streaked maniac… maybe the green religion isn’t all bad.

Just don’t tell anyone I said that.

I still have a reputation to uphold.
