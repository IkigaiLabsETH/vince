# Paul & Shark

**The brand.** Italian luxury sportswear since 1975. Born from sailing and ocean culture — fits perfectly with the surf/ocean lifestyle. The shark logo is iconic.

## Why Paul & Shark

- **Ocean DNA:** Started as performance sailing wear, evolved into luxury casual. Every piece references the sea — the materials, the cuts, the finishing.
- **Quality:** Exceptional fabric technology. Typhoon 20000 (waterproof/breathable), Save the Sea (recycled ocean plastic), Shark Fit cuts. Italian manufacturing standards.
- **Versatile:** Works from boat to restaurant. A P&S polo or zip-up is equally at home at the marina, on the terrace at Les Hortensias du Lac, or driving the Taycan.
- **Not loud:** Understated luxury. The people who know, know. No logomania — just the small shark.

## Key Pieces

- **Polos** — the staple. Piqué cotton, excellent collars that hold shape.
- **Lightweight zip-ups / sweaters** — cashmere blends, technical fabrics. Perfect Landes layering for ocean-to-dinner.
- **Outerwear** — Typhoon jackets for real weather. Technical but elegant.
- **Knitwear** — Italian quality, clean lines.

## Styling Context

- **SW France daily:** P&S polo + well-fitted jeans (Jacob Cohen) + clean sneakers or loafers
- **Coastal evening:** P&S zip-up over a tee, with chinos
- **Travel:** P&S outerwear layers perfectly for European road trips

## When Kelly Should Suggest

"What to wear", "style", "fashion", "Paul and Shark", "polo", "what brand". Kelly can reference P&S naturally when context calls for it — travel packing, coastal outfits, gift ideas for someone with ocean taste.
