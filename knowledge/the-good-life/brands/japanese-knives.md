# Japanese Kitchen Knives

On-brand with **IKIGAI STUDIO** and **IKIGAI LABS** — Japanese craftsmanship, precision, purpose. The same philosophy that drives the whisky and the company lives in the blade.

## Why Japanese Knives

Japanese knives are harder steel (60-67 HRC vs Western 56-58), thinner geometry, sharper edge. They cut cleaner, require more care, and reward skill. The trade-off: they chip if abused. Treat them right and nothing else compares.

## The Essential Three

### 1. Gyuto (牛刀) — Chef's Knife
- **The workhorse.** 210mm or 240mm. Japanese answer to the French chef's knife but lighter and sharper.
- **Use:** Everything — vegetables, meat, fish, herbs.
- **Top makers:** Masamoto, Misono, Takamura, MAC, Shun, Global.

### 2. Santoku (三徳) — Three Virtues
- **Shorter, wider blade** (165-180mm). "Three virtues" = meat, fish, vegetables.
- **Use:** Home cooks who prefer a shorter, more maneuverable blade.
- **Great entry point** into Japanese knives.

### 3. Petty (ペティ) — Utility Knife
- **Small (120-150mm).** For detail work — trimming, peeling, small cuts.
- **Complements the gyuto** perfectly.

## Beyond the Basics

- **Nakiri (菜切)** — vegetable knife, flat blade, no rocking. Precise push-cuts.
- **Sujihiki (筋引)** — slicing knife for proteins. The Japanese carving knife.
- **Deba (出刃)** — heavy, thick. For breaking down fish. The sushi bar tool.
- **Yanagiba (柳刃)** — long, single-bevel. Sashimi knife. The art piece.

## Steel Types

- **VG-10** — workhorse stainless. Sharp, holds edge well, easy maintenance. Most Shun knives.
- **SG2 / R2 (powder steel)** — harder, finer edge, excellent edge retention. Takamura.
- **White Steel (Shirogami)** — pure carbon, razor sharp, patinas beautifully. Requires care (dry after use).
- **Blue Steel (Aogami)** — carbon with tungsten/chromium. Better edge retention than white. The enthusiast's choice.
- **ZDP-189** — extreme hardness (67 HRC). Stays sharp forever. Harder to resharpen.

---

## Care

- **Hand wash only.** Never dishwasher. Dry immediately.
- **Sharpen on whetstones** — 1000 grit for regular maintenance, 3000-6000 for polish. King, Shapton, Naniwa stones.
- **Honing:** Japanese knives are too hard for a steel hone. Use a ceramic rod or just sharpen.
- **Storage:** Magnetic knife strip (wood-backed) or saya (blade cover). Never in a drawer loose.

## Pairing with Kelly's World

- **Home cooking:** The gyuto is the default for Green Egg prep, Thermomix mise en place, and oven roasts.
- **The ikigai connection:** Same as the whisky — Japanese precision, purpose, craft. The blade is the tool of someone who cares about the process.
- **Gift idea:** A quality gyuto (Takamura R2, Misono UX10) is one of the best gifts for someone who cooks.

## When Kelly Should Suggest

"Knife", "kitchen knife", "Japanese knife", "best chef's knife", "sharpening", "what knife to buy". One recommendation + why. Reference the ikigai connection naturally.
