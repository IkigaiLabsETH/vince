# Building Wealth: ETFs and Index Funds

Many people think building wealth is about:

## Context

- Being a good investor  
- Timing the market  
- Picking the right investments  

It's not.

## 1. Understanding the Core Principle

## Main

Building wealth is about **owning productive assets over a long period of time**.

Stocks, real estate, precious metals, crypto… all of this sounds very complicated. But fortunately, the most effective way to build wealth is also the easiest one.

The holy grail is the stock market, more specifically **index funds (ETFs)**. For those new to investing: ETFs let you invest in entire categories rather than individual stocks. For example, you can invest in the entire energy sector instead of picking individual energy stocks.

Keep it as simple as possible. Your goal is to invest **as diversely as possible** in order to capture the broader market return and avoid concentration risk in your portfolio. The simplest way to do this is by investing in an **All-World ETF**, which essentially covers the entire stock market.

The internet is full of stock tips and people claiming they can beat the market. The reality is that **fewer than 10% of hedge funds** manage to outperform the market over a 20-year period. And we are talking about billion-dollar funds with analyst teams working around the clock.

Even if you could theoretically outperform the market over the long term (which you can't), **taxes still exist**. They make a passive buy-and-hold strategy far superior. Holding an ETF for decades and deferring taxes until sale allows compound interest to work in your favor.

Active trading and constantly rotating individual stocks would destroy your returns in most countries purely because of taxes.

## 2. Compound Interest

Your expected return with this strategy is historically around **8% per year**. That does not sound like much at first glance, until you factor in **compound interest**. As a simple rule of thumb, your money roughly **doubles every 10 years**.

**$10 invested today becomes:**

- $20 in 10 years  
- $40 in 20 years  
- $80 in 30 years  
- $160 in 40 years  

After 40 years, you have already multiplied your money by sixteen.

$10,000 invested today at an 8% annual return grows to just over $1,000,000 after 60 years. Of course, $1,000,000 in 60 years will not have the same purchasing power as today. But for the sake of simplicity, we are ignoring inflation here.

## 3. When to Start Investing?

**Now.** Your goal is not to wait for the perfect entry, but to **stay invested in the market for as long as possible**. Many people are afraid to invest at all-time highs.

The S&P 500 reaches a new all-time high on roughly **8% of all trading days**. If investing at those points scares you, it will likely cost you a lot of returns.

If you have a lot of money that you want to invest, it's understandable that you don't want to put it all into the market at once. Even though **lump-sum investing is statistically superior**, it's emotionally understandable and totally justifiable to **dollar-cost average** into the market over two to three years.

## 4. Asset Allocation

What other assets should you buy?

In general, **ETFs should make up the majority of your portfolio**. It depends somewhat on the size of your portfolio, but **70–80% is a reasonable lower bound**. As your portfolio grows, it makes more sense to diversify into other asset classes.

**Crypto** makes little sense for most people. The only exception is **Bitcoin**, where an allocation of **2–5%** is reasonable. It is a niche where you can make a lot of money by exploiting market inefficiencies. But unless you do this professionally, you'll most likely end up losing money. It is important to clearly distinguish between **investing** and **active trading**.

**Real estate** is complex and highly individual, depending on where you live. Buying makes sense in two scenarios:

1. Your portfolio is already large and you want additional diversification  
2. You are willing to invest significant time and deeply understand the local market  

Otherwise, you will not beat stock market returns and you will have significantly more work on top of that.

**Precious metals** belong in a long-term portfolio. If your portfolio is still small, you do not need them. Once your portfolio reaches a certain size, diversification becomes more important. Around **10% in gold and silver** is a reasonable guideline.

## 5. Retirement

At what point can you retire?

Assume your portfolio is 100% invested in ETFs. It's not enough to simply say that the 8% expected return needs to cover your expenses, because **returns are not evenly distributed over time**.

Market fluctuations mean that during crashes, you may be forced to withdraw more than 8% of your portfolio. Over time, this can cause your portfolio to shrink, even if your average return remains 8%. This is **sequence of returns risk**.

A commonly used rule of thumb is the **4% rule**. It states that you can withdraw around **4% of your portfolio each year** with a high probability of not running out of money over time. To calculate how large your portfolio needs to be in order to live off the returns, take your **monthly expenses and multiply them by 300**.

**Example** (assuming you want to live on $6,000 per month):

## Conclusion

- $6,000 × 300 = **$1,800,000**  
- → With a portfolio of $1,800,000, you could comfortably withdraw $6,000 per month and live off it.

The goal shouldn't be to retire as fast as possible. It's much more about **understanding how to use time and compound interest to your advantage**. Starting as early as possible is crucial, and even small savings rates make a huge difference over time.
