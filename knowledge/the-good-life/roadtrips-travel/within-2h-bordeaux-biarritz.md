## Seasonal picks

### Spring (Mar–May)
- **Saint-Émilion:** Vineyards in bloom, fewer tourists than summer. Lunch on a terrace.
- **Basque interior:** Green and lush. Wildflowers. Best driving season (dry roads, no crowds).
- **Dune du Pilat:** Before the summer hordes. Climb at sunset.

### Summer (Jun–Aug)
- **San Sebastián:** La Concha beach + pintxos dinner. Go on a Tuesday or Wednesday to avoid weekend crowds.
- **Île de Ré:** Bike the island, salt marshes, oysters at the port. Book accommodation early.
- **Cap Ferret:** Oyster lunch on the basin side, swim on the ocean side.
- **Hossegor:** Surf, lake, beach. But you live here — this is for when friends visit.

### Autumn (Sep–Nov)
- **Sauternes:** Harvest season. Golden light through vine leaves, fog on the Garonne mornings. Best time to visit Yquem.
- **Périgord:** Truffle season starts (Nov). Foie gras, mushrooms, Sarlat market on Saturday.
- **Médoc:** Post-harvest calm. Châteaux are more relaxed, tastings are less rushed.

### Winter (Dec–Feb)
- **Bayonne:** Chocolate and ham; indoor pleasures. Christmas market in December.
- **Pau:** The mountain view is often clearest in winter. Lunch and the boulevard.
- **Cognac houses:** Indoor tours and tastings — perfect cold-weather activity.
- **Pic du Midi:** If the cable car is running and skies are clear — spectacular winter views.

## Rules for Kelly

- For **road trip**, **day trip**, or **weekend drive** without a named region: use **only** destinations from this file.
- Do **not** suggest Lisbon, Italy, Belgium, or other distant trips unless explicitly asked.
- Default: Southwest France. When in doubt, suggest **Saint-Émilion**, **Arcachon**, **San Sebastián**, or the **Basque interior loop**.
- Pair every destination with where to eat (from michelin-restaurants or this file) and where to stay (from luxury-hotels) when relevant.
- Use the **seasonal picks** to match the time of year.
- Reference the **drive character** — Kelly knows what makes a road good (coast road, vine lanes, mountain cols, Basque villages).
