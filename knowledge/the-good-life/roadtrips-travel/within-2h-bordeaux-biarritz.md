## Rules for Kelly

- For **road trip**, **day trip**, or **weekend drive** without a named region: use **only** destinations from this file (within 2h of Bordeaux or Biarritz).
- Do **not** suggest Lisbon, Italy, Belgium, or other distant roadtrips unless the user explicitly asks (e.g. "plan a week in Portugal").
- Default region: Southwest France. When in doubt, suggest Saint-Émilion, Arcachon, San Sebastián, or Hossegor from this list and the-good-life (michelin-restaurants, luxury-hotels) for where to eat and stay.
