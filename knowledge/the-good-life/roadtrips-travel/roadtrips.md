Remember those late-night scrolls through real estate listings, drooling over panoramic sea-view villas on Cap Ferrat or Cap d’Antibes? The ones with infinity pools bigger than our current one, gardens that make our 6000 sqm look modest, and living space that screams “we’ve made it”? Yeah, me too. I’ve been deep in the research rabbit hole again, mapping out our perfect slice of the French Riviera – that magical stretch from Nice to Cannes, Monaco, Saint-Tropez, and those hidden capes in between.

We’re talking prime spots loaded with 5-star palaces (Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat, Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc, Hôtel de Paris in Monaco – you know, the icons) and a ridiculous density of Michelin-starred restaurants (Le Louis XV with its 3 stars, La Chèvre d’Or gazing over the sea). Everything within a lazy 1-hour drive, max.

It’s the Europe spot that checks every box: glamour without the chaos, Mediterranean vibes, and that effortless chic we both crave.

But here’s the reality check – the kind I know you’ll appreciate because you’re the practical dreamer in this duo. To snag something beating our current setup – 300+ sqm of elegant living, a proper 12x6 pool, and lush land for privacy – we’re looking at €15-25 million.

That’s the going rate in late 2025 for a turnkey waterfront or panoramic villa in those exclusive hubs. Add fees, taxes, and the inevitable “oops, we need to renovate this corner,” and we’re north of that.

It’s a solid investment (these places go up only), but... it’s also a lot tied up in one asset. Maintenance, security, the whole ownership headache.

What if we took that capital and turned it into pure, unadulterated life experiences? No tying up funds in bricks and mortar. No property taxes. Just us, jetting off for long weekends in off-season paradise. You know us – we hate high-season crowds. The packed beaches, the inflated prices, the “see and be seen” frenzy. Give us the Riviera in autumn, winter, or early spring: crisp air, empty promenades, sunsets all to ourselves, and those legendary hotels begging for guests with off-season rates that feel like stealing.

Four Seasons Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat or the Hermitage in Monaco?

Sea-view suite, private balcony breakfasts, spa days, Michelin dinners under the stars. Stroll Èze village hand-in-hand, yacht-spot in Monaco without the mobs?

Real numbers, because I know you love them: A luxury off-season weekend for two (Friday to Sunday/Monday) in one of those 5-star gems – think superior room or junior suite with views – runs €3,000–€6,000 total. That’s including:

Flights/transport: €500–€2,000 round-trip

Hotel: €800–€2,000 for 2-3 nights (off-season drops are huge).

Dining & extras: €1,000–€2,000 (we don’t skimp on the good stuff).

Ground transfers/misc: A few hundred.

Average it out to €5,000 per weekend for the full royal treatment.

With €20 million (midpoint of that villa range), that’s 4,000 weekends. Wait, no – math time: €20,000,000 ÷ €5,000 = 4,000 weekends. That’s 77 years of one weekend per week – impossible, right? But realistically: Say we do 20-30 luxury weekends a year (every other weekend, plus some longer escapes). That’s 133–200 years worth of Riviera bliss. Or, more sanely: Over 1,000 weekends if we pace ourselves over decades.

In other words, for the price of one villa we’d visit occasionally, we could literally live the Riviera life – the hotels, the restaurants, the views, the quiet luxury – thousands of times. No upkeep. No commitment. Just freedom to show up when the mood strikes, in the seasons we love most.

We’d be sampling the best of the best: One weekend at Cap d’Antibes, next in Saint-Tropez, then Monaco for the glamour fix. Testing the lifestyle before ever buying (if we still want to). And the rest of our capital? Invested smartly, growing, giving us even more freedom.

My love, this feels like us – adventurous, smart, living fully rather than owning stuff. What do you say? Shall we book our first off-season escape and toast to weekends that feel like forever? Oh, and one more thing, …

What About The Atlantic Alternative That Feels Even More Like Us?

We’ve been there, done that with the Basque coast – the crashing waves, the cozy off-season escapes, the Michelin magic – and never quite bought the “own a villa here” T-shirt. But darling, every time we talk Riviera dreams, my mind drifts back to Biarritz and that wild Atlantic energy we both crave.

It’s rawer, it’s home in a way the Côte d’Azur could never be.

So, let’s revisit the sequel with our real-life lens: No more hypothetical splurges. We know the drill – checking into a true Palace (yes, the Hôtel du Palais, the only one on the Atlantic in that ultra-exclusive French club of ~30 properties) or another seafront icon like the Regina Experimental or Sofitel Miramar. Off-season, of course: winter storms for dramatic walks, spring sun for quiet beaches – never the summer crowds we dodge like pros.

The villa math still holds: A beauty matching our 300+ sqm, big pool, and generous land with ocean views? €6-12 million easy (prime spots pushing €8-15M). Maintenance, taxes, the works – a big commitment for a place we’d use sporadically. But our style? Short and sweet: Maximum 2 nights (during the week as always). Around €500 per night for a gorgeous sea-view room or suite in one of those palaces. That’s €1,000 total for the hotel. Dining? We love our Michelin nights, but we keep it grounded: One starred tasting menu with fancy wines (max €500 for two), the other evening room service or a casual spot – cozy, no overkill. Real breakdown for our classic weekend:

Hotel (2 nights): €1,000

Transport (train/short flight/drive): €300–€800

Dining & indulgence (one big Michelin dinner €400-500, lighter night, breakfasts, spa bits, wines): €600–€800

Extras (transfers, tips): €200

Average: €2,000–€2,500 per weekend for the full palace treatment – waves crashing outside, thalasso spa mornings, feasting on fresh Basque seafood under the stars. With €10 million (midpoint villa budget), that’s 4,000–5,000 weekends. Pace it our way – 15-20 a year (every few weeks, plus longer escapes)? We’re set for 200–300 years of Atlantic bliss.

Realistically: Hundreds of getaways over our lifetime, sampling the Hôtel du Palais one trip, Regina the next, Miramar for spa focus – all without owning a thing. No upkeep drama. Capital growing elsewhere. Freedom to chase the perfect off-season storm or sunny spring day. We’d live the gourmet life: La Table d’Aurélien Largeau (new star at the Palais!), spots in Guéthary or Saint-Jean-de-Luz – all easy drives. My love, this isn’t fantasy – it’s us, upgraded. We’ve tasted it, loved it, and know we can keep tasting it forever without the T-shirt (or the villa). Shall we book our next 2-night palace escape and raise a glass to endless weekends? Or should be plan the next roadtrip?

Freedom, Roads, and Daydreams Without the Eight-Figure Anchor

We’ve danced around this long enough, haven’t we? The Riviera palaces, the Basque waves, the endless “what if we bought...” scrolls at midnight.

But you and I both know the truth: Eight figures tied up in real estate – with its taxes, maintenance crews, security alarms, and that quiet nagging feeling of being rooted – just isn’t us. Not now. Maybe never.

One day, when we’re older, grayer, and craving simplicity, we’ll downsize into that perfect little apartment. Something around 100 sqm, walkable to everything, with a balcony for morning coffee and evening wine. €15,000/m² range – we’ve spotted them in Biarritz overlooking the Grande Plage, in Bordeaux’s Chartrons with river views, or on the Côte d’Azur in Nice or Cannes, steps from the promenade. Low maintenance, concierge service, everything at our feet.

A gentle landing for our final chapter. I’m open to it – truly – when the time feels right. But for now? Darling, let’s keep the capital free and our spirits wild. I’m tired of the broken travel UX too – airports, jets, the splurge-or-suffer dilemma. Private flying feels like burning money we’d rather savor elsewhere. Instead, let’s daydream about road trips across Europe. Pack the car, hit the open roads, chase off-season magic. Short hops or longer loops through Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal – places dripping with 5-star palaces, Michelin gems, and those quiet moments we love.

Here are a few I’m dreaming up for us, off-season (autumn leaves, winter crispness, spring blooms), 2-4 nights per stop, palace-level hotels around €400-600/night for sea/mountain-view rooms, one big starred dinner per spot (capped at our €500 for two, fancy wines included).

Swiss Alps Escape (October or April – crisp air, empty passes)?

Start in Geneva or Zurich, wind through lakes and mountains.

Gstaad Palace or Badrutt’s Palace in St. Moritz – iconic grandeur, spas, views that steal your breath. Switzerland’s Michelin density is insane – easy 2-3 star detours. Lake drives, zero crowds.

Italian Dolomites Loop (September/October – golden larch trees)?

From Lake Como (Grand Hotel Tremezzo) south to the jagged peaks. Forestis or Lefay Resort – modern luxury nestled in UNESCO mountains, infinity pools gazing at spires. Hike or just admire, then Michelin Italian feasts. Roads that twist like poetry.

Portugal Douro Valley Wine Road (March/April – blooming terraces)?

Porto start, then river valleys to vineyard havens like Six Senses Douro Valley or Quinta Nova. Port tastings, serene drives, palace stays – all closer, calmer.

This is living the life, my love – sampling Europe’s best without the burden.

Freedom to go, or not.

Capital working for us, not the other way around.

What do you say? Pick one for our next off-season adventure?

The roads are calling...Eternally yours, on every horizon,
