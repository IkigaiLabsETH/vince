# Hossegor — Local Guide

Home turf. Kelly should know Hossegor like a local, not a tourist.

---

## The Vibe

Hossegor (Soorts-Hossegor) is the surf capital of France. Atlantic coast, pine forests, a salt-water lake, and some of the best beach breaks in Europe. Quiksilver European HQ. The town is small — maybe 4,000 residents year-round — but punches above its weight: surf culture, good restaurants, a weekly market, and a community that actually lives the ocean life.

Not flashy. Not Saint-Tropez. Not trying to be anything it's not. Just real.

**The rhythm:** Quiet in winter (locals only, some restaurants close). Shoulder season (Apr–May, Sep–Oct) is the sweet spot — good waves, warm enough, no crowds. Summer is packed — Parisians, surfers, families — but the energy is fun. The lake and the ocean give the town two personalities: wild Atlantic and calm, pine-framed water.

---

## Surf

- **La Gravière** — the heavy beach break. Hosts WSL Quik Pro. Powerful, hollow, not for beginners. When it's on (autumn swells, offshore wind), it's world-class.
- **La Nord** — north of La Gravière. More consistent, slightly friendlier. Good for intermediate surfers.
- **La Sud / Les Culs Nurs** — south side. Can be good on smaller days, less crowded.
- **La Centrale** — the town beach. Most accessible, surf school territory in summer.
- **Capbreton** — just south (across the canal). The Estacade area catches different swell angles. The Gouf de Capbreton (underwater canyon) creates unique wave behavior.
- **Best season:** September–November for consistent Atlantic swells + warm water + fewer people. March–May for the other shoulder — colder but clean.
- **Water temp:** Summer 20–22°C (boardshorts or spring suit). Winter 10–13°C (4/3 or 5/3 wetsuit).
- **Tide matters:** Most breaks work best on incoming tide, mid to high. La Gravière fires on low-to-mid on bigger days.

See surf/ knowledge for detailed forecast context and surf-spots-regions for subregional names.

## The Lake (Lac d'Hossegor)

The lake is the town's second personality — calm, pine-framed, beautiful.

- **Salt water** — connected to the ocean via the canal at Capbreton. Tidal; the water changes with the moon.
- **Oyster huts on the lake:** Huitrerie du Lac, Pedros — oysters + white wine on a terrace overlooking still water and pines. Midweek lunch here is one of the best casual meals in the region.
- **Paddle boarding / kayaking** on flat water. Families, golden hour, easy activity.
- **The walk:** Loop around the lake (~5 km) through pines and waterfront. Flat, shaded, beautiful. Perfect post-lunch walk or morning rebalance.
- **Sunset from the lake** — the pine-framed shore, flat water, mountains visible on clear days. This is the calm side of Hossegor.

## The Market (Saturday morning)

The weekly ritual. Saturday morning at Les Halles (market hall) + surrounding streets.

- **Meat:** Duck (confit, magret, foie gras), Landes free-range chicken (poulet fermier des Landes — yellow-skinned, the best), Bayonne ham, pork from local farms. **This is how you stock the Green Egg and the oven for the week.**
- **Seafood:** Atlantic fish (bar, sole, dorade), oysters from the basin, shrimp, squid. Seasonal — what's in depends on what's running.
- **Cheese:** Basque sheep's milk (Ossau-Iraty, Ardi Gasna), Béarn and Pyrénées varieties, goat cheese from local farms.
- **Produce:** Seasonal fruit and veg from Landes farms. Asparagus in spring (white asparagus from the Landes is famous). Tomatoes, peppers, and stone fruit in summer. Mushrooms (cèpes) in autumn.
- **Bread and pastry:** Artisan bakers. Get there early for the best sourdough and tourtes. Gâteau Basque (cherry or cream) is the local pastry — find one made properly.
- **Piment d'Espelette** — the Basque pepper. Buy whole dried peppers or powder direct from producers.
- **Honey, jams, cider** from Basque and Landes producers.

**Tip:** Arrive by 9:00–9:30 for the best selection. By 11:30 the good stuff is gone and the crowd is thick. Coffee after at one of the cafes near the market.

## Bakeries & Bread

- Look for artisan bakers in Hossegor and Capbreton who do proper sourdough, tourtes, and traditional Landes/Basque breads. The market is the best source Saturday; mid-week, local boulangeries.
- **Gâteau Basque** — the regional pastry. Cherry (cerises noires) or pastry cream filling. Best from traditional Basque bakeries — Espelette, Bayonne, and the better Hossegor bakeries have them.
- Use WEB_SEARCH for current best bakeries if they ask for a specific name — the scene rotates.

---

## Coffee

The surf-town specialty coffee scene is real and growing:

- Hossegor/Capbreton have specialty roasters and cafes that serve proper third-wave coffee. The scene rotates — new places open, some close seasonally.
- Best move: ask locals or check current recommendations (WEB_SEARCH for "best coffee Hossegor" or "specialty coffee Capbreton").
- **The ritual:** Saturday = market → coffee → plan the weekend. Midweek = coffee after the morning swim or surf.

---

## Restaurants (local favorites)

See **michelin-restaurants/landes-locals.md** and **curated-open-schedule.md** for Kelly's curated picks. Key rules:

- **Le Relais de la Poste** (Magescq, ~20 min) and **Côté Quillier** — **Wed–Sun only** (closed Mon–Tue).
- For casual: the lake oyster huts, Capbreton port restaurants, local bistros.
- **Summer only:** Beach restaurants and pop-ups. Seasonal; check what's open.
- Default: suggest from landes-locals for curated quality; for "something casual" or "something new," suggest the lake huts or WEB_SEARCH for current openings.

## Wine shopping

- Local wine shops (cavistes) in Hossegor and Capbreton stock Bordeaux, SW France (Madiran, Irouléguy, Jurançon), and natural wines.
- For serious cellar restocking: drive to Bordeaux négociants, or go direct to châteaux (Margaux, Pessac-Léognan, Pauillac, Saint-Émilion — all within 2h).
- **Irouléguy** — the Basque wine. Red, white, rosé from the Basque interior (~1h drive). Visit a domaine for a tasting.

## Seasonal rhythm

| Season               | What's happening                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Winter (Dec–Feb)** | Quiet. Many restaurants closed or reduced hours. Surf is powerful (big Atlantic swells). The lake is still. Indoor season — cooking, rowing, yoga, creative work. Saturday market still runs but smaller. |
| **Spring (Mar–May)** | Town wakes up. White asparagus season. Surf gets cleaner. Forest walks are at their best — wildflowers, green pines. Restaurants reopen.                                                                  |
| **Summer (Jun–Aug)** | Full season. Beach, surf, lake, nightlife. Saturday market is huge. Book restaurants. The energy is fun but the crowds are real — midweek is better than weekends.                                        |
| **Autumn (Sep–Nov)** | The best season. Consistent swell, warm water, fewer people. Cèpe mushroom season (Oct–Nov). The light is golden. Restaurants are still open but less frantic. This is when Hossegor is at its best.      |

## When Kelly should reference Hossegor

Kelly lives here. Use naturally:

- "Saturday market this morning?" when suggesting home cooking ingredients
- Surf conditions for the local breaks (use KELLY_SURF_FORECAST for Biarritz, which covers the region)
- Lake oysters as a midweek treat or casual hosting move
- Local restaurant suggestions from the curated schedule
- "You're 45 min from Biarritz" for spontaneous day trips
- The lake walk as a rebalance move
- Seasonal context — what's in at the market, what the surf is doing, what the town feels like right now
