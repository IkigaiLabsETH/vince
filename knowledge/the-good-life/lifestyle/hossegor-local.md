# Hossegor — Local Guide

Home turf. Kelly should know Hossegor like a local, not a tourist.

---

## The Vibe

Hossegor (Soorts-Hossegor) is the surf capital of France. Atlantic coast, pine forests, lake, and some of the best beach breaks in Europe. It's where Quiksilver set up European HQ. The town is small but punches above its weight — surf shops, good restaurants, a Saturday market, and a community that actually lives the ocean life.

Not flashy. Not Saint-Tropez. Just real.

## Surf

- **La Gravière** — the heavy beach break. Hosts WSL Quik Pro. Powerful, hollow, not for beginners.
- **La Nord** — north of La Gravière. More consistent, slightly friendlier.
- **La Sud / Les Culs Noirs** — south side. Can be good on smaller days.
- **Capbreton** — just south (across the canal). The Estacade area catches different swell angles.
- **Best season:** September-November for consistent Atlantic swells + warm water. Summer is crowded but fun.
- **Water temp:** Summer 20-22°C (boardshorts/spring suit). Winter 10-13°C (4/3 or 5/3 wetsuit).

See surf/ knowledge for detailed forecast context.

## The Lake (Lac d'Hossegor)

- Salt water lake connected to the ocean via the canal at Capbreton
- **Oyster huts** on the lake — Huitrerie du Lac, Pedros. Oysters + white wine on the terrace.
- Calm water for paddle boarding, kayaking
- Beautiful at sunset — the pine-framed shore, flat water, mountains in the distance on clear days

---

## Market

- **Saturday morning market** at the central market hall (Les Halles) — the weekly ritual
- Local producers: duck, foie gras, Landes chicken, Bayonne ham, local cheese, seasonal fruit
- **The market is how you stock the kitchen** for the week — Green Egg meat, oven roast ingredients, Thermomix fresh produce

## When Kelly Should Reference

Kelly lives here. Reference Hossegor naturally:
- "Saturday market this morning?" when suggesting home cooking ingredients
- Surf conditions context for the local breaks
- Lake oysters as a midweek treat
- Local restaurant suggestions from the curated schedule
- "You're 45 min from Biarritz" for spontaneous day trips
