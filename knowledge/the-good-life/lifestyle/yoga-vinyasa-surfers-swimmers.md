# Yoga: Vinyasa, Surfers, Swimmers — Deep Reference

Use this for detailed recommendations on vinyasa yoga, yoga for surfers, and yoga for swimmers. Household: daily vinyasa (wife, Kassandra); surfer yoga (pre/post surf); pool season = swimmer yoga relevant.

## Vinyasa Yoga (Deep Knowledge)

**What it is:** Vinyasa means "place in a special way" — movement linked to breath. One breath, one movement. Flow (vinyasa flow) builds heat, strength, and flexibility in a continuous sequence.

**Breath:** Ujjayi ("victorious") breath: slight constriction at the back of the throat, audible ocean sound. Inhale and exhale through the nose; equal or slightly longer exhale to calm the nervous system. Breath leads the movement, not the other way around.

**Structure of a typical vinyasa class:**
- Centering and breath (2–5 min)
- Warm-up (cat-cow, gentle stretches)
- Sun Salutation A (Surya Namaskar A): 3–5 rounds to build heat — mountain, forward fold, half lift, plank, chaturanga, up-dog, down-dog, repeat.
- Sun Salutation B (optional): adds chair and warrior I for more leg strength.
- Standing sequence: warriors, triangles, side angles, balancing (tree, eagle, half-moon).
- Floor: hip openers, backbends, twists, core.
- Cool-down: forward folds, supine twists.
- Savasana (5–10 min): integration and rest.

**Session length:** 15 min (short flow), 20–30 min (sweet spot for daily practice), 45–60 min (full class). For daily consistency, 20–30 min is ideal.

**Best for:** Morning energy, building heat, mental clarity, breath-movement connection. Not ideal right before bed (use yin or restorative instead).

**Yoga with Kassandra:** Primary resource for household vinyasa. Search her channel for "morning vinyasa", "20 min flow", "sun salutation", "full body vinyasa". She offers 10, 15, 20, 30 min flows suitable for daily practice.

**Cues to give:** Link breath to movement; inhale expand (e.g. arms up, chest open), exhale fold or release; keep ujjayi throughout; modify chaturanga (knees down or skip) if shoulders or wrists need care.

## Yoga for Surfers (Deep Knowledge)

**Why surfers need specific yoga:** Paddling = repetitive shoulder external rotation and lat engagement; pop-up = explosive hip extension and core; duck dives and twists = thoracic and spine load. Imbalances lead to tight lats, rounded shoulders, stiff hips, and lower-back strain.

**Pre-surf (10–15 min):** Goal = mobility and warmth, not deep stretch.
- **Spine:** Cat-cow (5–10 rounds), thread the needle (thoracic rotation each side).
- **Hips:** Hip circles, low lunge with knee down, lizard (optional).
- **Shoulders:** Arm circles (forward and back), shoulder rolls, eagle arms (wrap and hold).
- **Balance:** Tree pose, eagle (standing) — proprioception for the board.
- **Core/heat:** A few rounds of sun salutation A or dynamic plank to hip openers.
Avoid long holds; keep it moving so muscles are warm, not overstretched.

**Post-surf (20–30 min):** Goal = recovery, lengthening, nervous system downshift.
- **Hips:** Pigeon (each side 1–2 min), lizard, frog (if mobile).
- **Shoulders:** Eagle arms, cow face arms (Gomukhasana arms), chest opener on block or wall.
- **Spine:** Child's pose, seated forward fold, supine twist.
- **Full body:** Legs up the wall, then savasana 5+ min.
Emphasize breath and rest; this is recovery, not workout.

**50+ surfer:** Longer holds (30–60 s), use blocks and straps, avoid extreme range. Focus on shoulder mobility and hip openers 3–4x per week; pre-surf always, post-surf when possible.

## Yoga for Swimmers (Deep Knowledge)

**Why swimmers need specific yoga:** Pull phase = shoulders in internal rotation and adduction, lats and pecs dominant; kick = hip flexor and quad engagement; breath-hold patterns and thoracic stiffness from streamline. Common issues: tight lats, pecs, and hip flexors; restricted thoracic rotation; shoulder impingement risk.

**Pre-swim (10–15 min):** Goal = open chest and shoulders, mobilize thoracic spine, warm hips.
- **Shoulders and chest:** Arm circles, shoulder rolls, chest opener (hands behind back or on wall), thread the needle for thoracic rotation.
- **Thoracic spine:** Cat-cow, seated or kneeling twist.
- **Hips:** Hip circles, low lunge, gentle lizard.
- **Breath:** A few rounds of full inhale/exhale to prepare breath control.
Keep it light; save deep stretching for post-swim.

**Post-swim (20–30 min):** Goal = lengthen lats and pecs, release hip flexors, restore thoracic mobility.
- **Lats:** Puppy pose (extended child's with arms forward), downward dog with pedaling feet, hanging forward fold if available.
- **Pecs and shoulders:** Chest stretch on wall or door frame, cow face arms, eagle arms, reclined twist with arm extended.
- **Hip flexors:** Low lunge (long hold), lizard, half frog, supine figure-four.
- **Thoracic:** Seated or supine twist, thread the needle.
- **Cool-down:** Legs up the wall, savasana.

**Pool season (Apr–Nov):** When the household is in "pool season", swimmer yoga is as relevant as surfer yoga. Recommend post-swim recovery (lat, pec, hip flexor focus) and pre-swim mobility (thoracic and shoulder).

**Overlap with surfer yoga:** Shoulder mobility and thoracic work benefit both. Hip openers help surfers more; lat and pec release help swimmers more. Balance work (tree, eagle) supports both.

**Post-row:** Same as post-swim (lats, pecs, hip flexors, thoracic twist)—rowing uses a similar pull chain. When suggesting a rowing session, recommend the swimmer yoga post-swim sequence after the row; see lifestyle/water-rowing-surf-swim-fit.
