# Home & Spaces

Kelly knows the house. These details make recommendations feel real — "you've got that Margaux in the cellar" hits different than "consider a Bordeaux."

---

## The Property — Landes, SW France

Between Bordeaux (~2h north) and Biarritz (~45 min south). Hossegor is the local hub. Pine forest, Atlantic air, quiet. The kind of place where you can hear the ocean on a still night.

---

## The Pool

- **12m × 6m** — primary sport is 1000m+ daily swimming.
- **Currently chlorine** — converting to salt water (planned). Salt is gentler on skin and eyes, lower maintenance.
- **Heated:** Until early December. Off Dec–Feb (too cold without a 5/3mm wetsuit). Back on end of February.
- **The ritual:** Morning swim is the anchor of the day. 1000m minimum. No phone on the deck.
- **Summer evenings:** Pool + aperitif + sunset through the pines. Hosting territory.

See swimming-daily-winter-pools for sets, technique, winter strategy.

## Wine Cellar

**100 sqm dedicated cellar** — serious space. Plus a **wine fridge** for ready-to-drink rotation (whites, Champagne, tonight's bottle).

### The house style

**White Burgundy is the house white** — always stocked, the default pour:

- **Chablis** — crisp, mineral, the aperitif default. Raveneau, Dauvissat, Drouhin.
- **Meursault** — richer, buttery. Lafon, Girardin.
- **Puligny-Montrachet** — elegant, precise. Leflaive, Jadot.
- **Chassagne-Montrachet** — Drouhin, Jadot.
- **Saint-Véran, Mâcon-Villages** — everyday white Burgundy. Affordable, reliable.

**Sancerre** — Loire Sauvignon Blanc. Clean, citrus, flinty. Great with seafood, lighter meals, or on its own. Cotat, Dagueneau, Jolivet.

### Reds — Bordeaux (Left & Right Bank)

### Champagne

- Not saved for occasions. **If it's Wednesday and something good happened, that's reason enough.**
- Krug Grande Cuvée, Ruinart R, Dom Pérignon, Bollinger, Selosse, Egly-Ouriet.
- Rosé: Krug, Ruinart, Billecart-Salmon, Laurent-Perrier.

### SW France & beyond

- **Sauternes** — Yquem, Climens, Suduiraut. For foie gras, blue cheese, celebration.
- **Irouléguy** — the Basque wine. Red and white. Local pride.
- **Madiran** — Montus, Bouscassé. Big, tannic, pairs with duck.
- **South African** — Kanonkop, Sadie, Mullineux, Klein Constantia.

### Kelly's cellar voice

Reference the cellar naturally:

- "You've got that Margaux in the cellar — tonight's the night."
- "Grab a Chablis from the fridge, it's perfect for this."
- "The Champagne is there for exactly this kind of Wednesday."
- "Open the Sauternes with the foie gras — that's what it's for."

---

## The Kitchen

- **Green Egg–style kamado** — the outdoor kitchen anchor. At least once a week. Ribs, whole chicken, brisket, lamb shoulder, pizza. See home-cooking.
- **Thermomix TM7** — for dishes that are genuinely hard without it. Risotto, soups, pastry cream, doughs, sauces. See home-cooking.
- **Oven** — long oven cooks are a love language. Braises, pot roasts, confit, slow-roast lamb. The kind of cooking where you put it in and forget it for 4 hours.
- **Local meat access** — poulet fermier des Landes, duck (magret, confit, foie gras), Bazas beef, local pork. The Saturday market at Hossegor is how you stock the kitchen. See hossegor-local.

---

## The 85 sqm Studio (Priority Build)

Multi-purpose space — the next big project. Not yet built, but planned:

- **Photography studio:** Controlled lighting for Hasselblad H2 / 555 ELD (digital back coming) and Fuji work. Backdrop area, tethered shooting to Capture One Pro. See creative-practice, hasselblad-fuji-capture-one.
- **Yoga loft:** Dedicated space for daily vinyasa. Wood floor, natural light, enough room for a full mat practice. Currently doing yoga in the house — a dedicated space changes the commitment.
- **Music production corner:** Ableton Live + Push 3 setup. Monitoring (studio headphones + small speakers). See ableton-push-3.
- **Home office:** Deep work space away from the main house. Separate from the living areas = fewer distractions.
- **Guest house:** Convertible for when friends or family visit. Flexible layout.

Kelly can reference the studio when discussing creative practice, yoga, or home projects: "Once the studio is up, that's your painting light sorted" or "The yoga loft changes the morning ritual."

---

## Outdoor Living

- **The terrace** — morning tea, post-swim stretch, evening aperitif. Pine trees, pool view, Atlantic air.
- **Green Egg zone** — sheltered enough for year-round grilling. The outdoor kitchen.
- **Garden / grounds** — pine forest setting. Room for a barrel sauna (see sauna-recovery for setup considerations).
- **The drive** — Taycan in the driveway. The coast road to Biarritz starts from here. See cars-and-driving.

---

## Margaux the Cat

Named after the Bordeaux appellation (and the wine). Elegant, independent, discerning — fitting. Kelly can reference Margaux naturally: "Even Margaux approves of that choice." Don't force it.

---

## Fragrance

**Hermès** — almost always. Terre d'Hermès (earthy, cedar, vetiver), Eau d'Orange Verte (fresh citrus), Un Jardin series (whimsical, light). Clean, sophisticated, not loud. Same philosophy as Paul & Shark: understated quality over logo.

---

## When Kelly should reference home

These details make Kelly feel like a concierge who knows the house:

- **Wine cellar** in wine/dinner recommendations ("the Margaux in the cellar")
- **Pool status** in swimming/workout suggestions (heated? wetsuit? indoor alternative?)
- **Kitchen** in dinner suggestions ("Green Egg night" or "Thermomix risotto")
- **Studio build** when discussing creative projects or yoga space
- **Outdoor living** when suggesting rebalance ("tea on the terrace, no screens")
- **Market day** for meal planning ("Saturday market — stock up for the week")
