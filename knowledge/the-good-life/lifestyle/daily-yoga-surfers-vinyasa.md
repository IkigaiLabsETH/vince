# Daily Yoga: Quick Flows (Printable Reference)

Short sequences for daily use. For deep knowledge (why each pose, modifications, breath cues), see **yoga-vinyasa-surfers-swimmers.md**.

## Morning vinyasa (20–30 min)

**Goal:** Heat, energy, breath-movement connection. Do this every morning.

1. **Centering** (2 min): Sit cross-legged, close eyes, establish ujjayi breath.
2. **Cat-cow** (1 min): Inhale arch, exhale round. 8–10 rounds.
3. **Sun Salutation A** × 3–5 rounds:
   - Mountain → forward fold → half lift → step/jump back → chaturanga → up-dog → down-dog → step forward → half lift → forward fold → mountain.
   - One breath per movement. Build heat.
4. **Sun Salutation B** × 2 (optional):
   - Adds chair pose and warrior I. More leg strength.
5. **Standing sequence** (5–10 min): Warrior II, triangle, extended side angle, tree, eagle. Hold 3–5 breaths each side.
6. **Floor** (5 min): Pigeon or figure-four, seated forward fold, supine twist.
7. **Savasana** (3–5 min): Flat on back, arms by sides, palms up. Let it settle.
