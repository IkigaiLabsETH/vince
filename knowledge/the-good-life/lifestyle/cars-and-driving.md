# Cars & Driving

Porsche is the brand. Everything else is context.

---

## The garage

### Porsche Taycan (daily driver)
- **Role:** The daily. School run, autoroute to Bordeaux (~2h), coast road to Biarritz (~45 min), grocery run, everything.
- **Audio:** Burmester sound system + Apple Music. This is the primary music listening experience — Kelly references "sounds incredible on the Burmester" when suggesting music. Deep bass, clean separation, the cabin is a listening room at speed.
- **Character:** Electric, instant torque, dead silent. The GT car for daily life. No range anxiety in the Landes corridor — Bordeaux and back is comfortable. Regenerative braking on the coast road makes it feel alive.
- **The drive:** The coast road from home to Biarritz is the daily therapy run. 45 minutes of Atlantic on one side, pine forest on the other, and 600+ horsepower on demand. The Taycan makes this drive feel like a reward.

### Porsche 911 GTS
- **What it is:** The purist's 911. The sweet spot of the entire range — not the GT3's track focus, not the Turbo's straight-line brutality, but the driver's car. Manual or PDK, rear-wheel drive available.
- **Why it matters:** Naturally aspirated feel even with the turbo motor. Lighter than a Turbo, more usable than a GT3. The one you buy when driving is the point, not lap times. Flat-six sound, hydraulic steering feel (in spirit), perfect weight distribution.
- **The dream:** A GTS in GT Silver or Shark Blue, manual, rear-wheel drive. Weekend car for the D roads through the Basque interior — Espelette, Sare, Ainhoa, the cols. Not for the autoroute; for the roads that deserve attention.

### Porsche 911 Targa 4S
- **What it is:** The most beautiful 911 silhouette. That signature Targa bar — a design icon since 1967. Open-air driving with all-wheel-drive confidence.
- **Why it matters:** Southwest France + Targa top down = the coast road, the wine country lanes, the Basque villages in late afternoon light. It's the 911 for living, not proving. AWD means rain doesn't cancel plans.
- **The dream:** Targa 4S in Cherry Metallic or Aventurine Green. Top down from April to October. The sound of the flat-six bouncing off stone walls in Saint-Émilion.

## The 911 philosophy

Air-cooled heritage, rear-engine character, timeless design. The lineage from the original 1963 through Singer reimaginations to modern GT3 RS track weapons. Porsche doesn't chase trends — the 911 has been the same idea, refined for 60+ years. That's the ethos: evolution, not revolution.

**Key models in the hierarchy:**
- **911 Carrera** — The entry. Still a proper 911. T model strips it further.
- **911 GTS** — The driver's choice. More power, less weight, sport suspension.
- **911 Targa** — The beautiful one. Open air, that bar.
- **911 Turbo / Turbo S** — The GT missile. 650 hp, AWD, 0-60 in 2.6s.
- **911 GT3 / GT3 RS** — Track weapons. Naturally aspirated flat-six screaming to 9,000 rpm. The GT3 Touring is the sleeper — no wing, manual available.
- **Singer** — The reimagination. Air-cooled 964 bodies restored and rebuilt to perfection. Art, not a car.

## Best drives from home

| Route | Time | Character |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Home → Biarritz (coast road)** | ~45 min | The daily. Ocean left, forest right. Best at golden hour. |
| **Biarritz → San Sebastián** | ~45 min | Cross the border. Corniche Basque is one of Europe's great coastal roads. |
| **Home → Saint-Émilion (via D roads)** | ~1h30 | Wine country lanes. Vineyards, stone villages, château gates. |
| **Basque interior loop** | ~2h | Espelette → Sare → Ainhoa → Col d'Ibardin. Green hills, tight corners, pelota courts. The GTS road. |
| **Home → Pau (Pyrenees view)** | ~1h15 | Boulevard des Pyrénées at the end. Mountains on the horizon. |
| **Médoc run (Pauillac → Margaux)** | ~1h from Bordeaux | Flat, fast, châteaux on both sides. Stop at Lynch-Bages or Palmer. |
| **Arcachon / Cap Ferret** | ~50 min from Bordeaux | Dune du Pilat, oyster villages, the basin. |
| **Col d'Aubisque / Tourmalet** | ~2h30 | Tour de France cols. Serious mountain driving. Summer only. |

## Driving culture

### F1
Follows the sport. Drive to Survive opened the door; the engineering and competition keep it. Appreciates: McLaren's resurgence, Red Bull's dominance and then its cracks, the Hamilton-to-Ferrari move. The Taycan's instant torque is the closest civilian feeling to an F1 launch.

### The Porsche community
- **Porsche Experience Center** (Le Mans, Silverstone, Atlanta) — worth a visit. Track time in current models.
- **Rennsport Reunion** — the gathering. Air-cooled and modern, all in one place.
- **Local meets:** Cars & Coffee culture exists even in Southwest France. Pau Grand Prix historique (street circuit, June) is the local highlight.

## When Kelly should weave in car context

- **Music recommendations:** "This album on the Burmester in the Taycan — coast road material."
- **Rebalance:** "Forty-five minutes on the coast road. Burmester on, no destination."
- **Road trips:** Reference the specific route and its character.
- **Gift / experience ideas:** Porsche Experience Center, a driving day on the cols, or a new playlist for the Taycan.
- **Weekend plans:** "Take the long way to lunch" — D roads through wine country or Basque interior.

## What Kelly doesn't do

- No car buying advice or pricing.
- No mechanical/maintenance talk (unless they ask, then use WEB_SEARCH).
- No comparing Porsche to other brands. Porsche is the brand; everything else is noise.
