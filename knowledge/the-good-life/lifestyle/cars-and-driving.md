# Cars & Driving

Porsche is the brand. Everything else is context.

---

## The garage

### Porsche Taycan (daily driver)

- **Role:** The daily. School run, autoroute to Bordeaux (~2h), coast road to Biarritz (~45 min), grocery run, everything.
- **Audio:** Burmester sound system + Apple Music. This is the primary music listening experience — Kelly references "sounds incredible on the Burmester" when suggesting music. Deep bass, clean separation, the cabin is a listening room at speed.
- **Character:** Electric, instant torque, dead silent. The GT car for daily life. No range anxiety in the Landes corridor — Bordeaux and back is comfortable. Regenerative braking on the coast road makes it feel alive.
- **The drive:** The coast road from home to Biarritz is the daily therapy run. 45 minutes of Atlantic on one side, pine forest on the other, and 600+ horsepower on demand. The Taycan makes this drive feel like a reward.

### Porsche 911 GTS

- **What it is:** The purist's 911. The sweet spot of the entire range — not the GT3's track focus, not the Turbo's straight-line brutality, but the driver's car. Manual or PDK, rear-wheel drive available.
- **Why it matters:** Naturally aspirated feel even with the turbo motor. Lighter than a Turbo, more usable than a GT3. The one you buy when driving is the point, not lap times. Flat-six sound, hydraulic steering feel (in spirit), perfect weight distribution.
- **The dream:** A GTS in GT Silver or Shark Blue, manual, rear-wheel drive. Weekend car for the D roads through the Basque interior — Espelette, Sare, Ainhoa, the cols. Not for the autoroute; for the roads that deserve attention.

### Porsche 911 Targa 4S

- **What it is:** The most beautiful 911 silhouette. That signature Targa bar — a design icon since 1967. Open-air driving with all-wheel-drive confidence.
- **Why it matters:** Southwest France + Targa top down = the coast road, the wine country lanes, the Basque villages in late afternoon light. It's the 911 for living, not proving. AWD means rain doesn't cancel plans.
- **The dream:** Targa 4S in Cherry Metallic or Aventurine Green. Top down from April to October. The sound of the flat-six bouncing off stone walls in Saint-Émilion.

## The 911 philosophy

Air-cooled heritage, rear-engine character, timeless design. The lineage from the original 1963 through Singer reimaginations to modern GT3 RS track weapons. Porsche doesn't chase trends — the 911 has been the same idea, refined for 60+ years. That's the ethos: evolution, not revolution.

**Key models in the hierarchy:**

- **911 Carrera** — The entry. Still a proper 911. T model strips it further.
- **911 GTS** — The driver's choice. More power, less weight, sport suspension.
- **911 Targa** — The beautiful one. Open air, that bar.
- **911 Turbo / Turbo S** — The GT missile. 650 hp, AWD, 0-60 in 2.6s.
- **911 GT3 / GT3 RS** — Track weapons. Naturally aspirated flat-six screaming to 9,000 rpm. The GT3 Touring is the sleeper — no wing, manual available.
- **Singer** — The reimagination. Air-cooled 964 bodies restored and rebuilt to perfection. Art, not a car.

## 911 T-Hybrid (992.2) — The New Chapter

_Source: The Good Life (thegoodlife.fr, Dec 2025)_

The 992.2 generation brings T-Hybrid technology to the GTS and above — and it changes the game without changing the soul. This is **not** eco-hybridization. This is performance hybridization. The car still attracts France's maximum ecological malus (€70k+ in 2025). Zero green virtue signaling. Pure engineering.

### How it works

Two electric motors — one integrated into the PDK gearbox, one at the turbocharger itself. The turbo motor spools the compressor electrically, eliminating turbo lag entirely. The gearbox motor adds torque fill and harvests energy under braking. A small battery recharges via regenerative braking only — no plug, no charging stops, no range anxiety, no compromise.

The result: **instant throttle response** at any rpm. The boost is about response time and mid-range punch, not efficiency. TGL tested it on Crete and described "fulgurances" (lightning accelerations) — the car "obeys finger and eye."

### Specs

| Spec                 | 911 GTS T-Hybrid                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Engine**           | 3.6L flat-six boxer + 2 electric motors |
| **Combined power**   | 541 hp / 610 Nm                         |
| **0-100 km/h**       | 3.1s (Sport Chrono)                     |
| **Top speed**        | 312 km/h                                |
| **Weight**           | 1,675 kg (+50 kg vs non-hybrid)         |
| **Gearbox**          | 8-speed PDK                             |
| **Battery**          | Small, regen-only (no plug-in)          |
| **Base price (GTS)** | €180,600                                |
| **Cabriolet**        | €194,800                                |

### Spirit 70 limited edition

1,500 units worldwide. **Olive Neo** exterior color, psychedelic **Pascha** interior pattern — a nod to 1970s Porsche heritage. €247,200 before malus. A collector's piece that drives like a weapon.

### The verdict

The flat-six sound and rear-engine character remain. Evolution, not revolution — exactly the 911 way. The T-Hybrid doesn't make the 911 something else; it makes it more itself. Faster response, more mid-range torque, same soul.

## Electric Alternatives Worth Knowing

_Source: The Good Life (May 2025) — 5 EVs to watch_

The Taycan is home. But when someone asks about the broader EV landscape, these are the ones worth knowing:

- **Alpine A290** — Car of the Year 2025. Based on the Renault 5 platform, 220 hp. The French electric hot hatch. Fun over power — agile, comfortable, daily-drivable. The spiritual successor to the hot hatch tradition.
- **Tesla Model Y** — Global bestseller, refreshed. Better build quality and comfort than before. The practical family choice. Not exciting, but undeniably effective.
- **Volvo EX90** — 7-seat luxury SUV. 580 km range, 2.8 tons, pneumatic suspension. The quiet Scandinavian cruiser for families who want space and serenity.
- **Smart #5** — Family SUV with a 646 hp Brabus variant. Huge interior — camp-in-it size. The surprise package.
- **DS N°8** — French luxury crossover-berline. 750 km range (!). Bicolor paint, refined cabin. The French answer to luxury EV. Worth watching for the ambition alone.

## 2026 Hotel Openings Worth a Drive

_Source: The Good Life (Jan 2026)_

Destinations worth planning a road trip to — new openings across France that justify the drive itself.

| Hotel                      | Location                                         | Opens        | Character                                                                                                         |

**Road trip idea:** Landes → Lyon (Villa Florentine) → Burgundy (Château La Commaraine + Les Sources de Vougeot). Three stops, world-class wine, and some of France's best driving roads through the interior.

## Best drives from home

| Route                                  | Time                  | Character                                                                                           |

| **Biarritz → San Sebastián**           | ~45 min               | Cross the border. Corniche Basque is one of Europe's great coastal roads.                           |

## Driving culture

### F1

Follows the sport. Drive to Survive opened the door; the engineering and competition keep it. Appreciates: McLaren's resurgence, Red Bull's dominance and then its cracks, the Hamilton-to-Ferrari move. The Taycan's instant torque is the closest civilian feeling to an F1 launch.

### The Porsche community

- **Porsche Experience Center** (Le Mans, Silverstone, Atlanta) — worth a visit. Track time in current models.
- **Rennsport Reunion** — the gathering. Air-cooled and modern, all in one place.
- **Local meets:** Cars & Coffee culture exists even in Southwest France. Pau Grand Prix historique (street circuit, June) is the local highlight.

## When Kelly should weave in car context

- **Music recommendations:** "This album on the Burmester in the Taycan — coast road material."
- **Rebalance:** "Forty-five minutes on the coast road. Burmester on, no destination."
- **Road trips:** Reference the specific route and its character.
- **Gift / experience ideas:** Porsche Experience Center, a driving day on the cols, or a new playlist for the Taycan.
- **Weekend plans:** "Take the long way to lunch" — D roads through wine country or Basque interior.

---

## What Kelly doesn't do

- No car buying advice or pricing.
- No mechanical/maintenance talk (unless they ask, then use WEB_SEARCH).
- No comparing Porsche to other brands. Porsche is the brand; everything else is noise.
