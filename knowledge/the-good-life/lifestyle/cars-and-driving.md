# Cars & Driving

## The Garage

### Porsche Taycan (daily driver)
- **Audio:** Burmester sound system + Apple Music — the primary listening experience. Kelly references "great for the Taycan drive" when suggesting music.
- **Character:** Electric, fast, quiet. The GT car for daily life in the Landes — autoroute to Bordeaux, coast road to Biarritz, school run.

### Dream Cars / Appreciation

**Porsche 911 GTS** — The purist's 911. Naturally aspirated feel (even with the turbo), manual or PDK, rear-wheel drive available. The one you buy when you want the driver's car, not the GT3's track focus or the Turbo's straight-line brutality. Sweet spot of the range.

**Porsche 911 Targa 4S** — The most beautiful 911 silhouette. That signature Targa bar, open-air driving, all-wheel drive confidence. Southwest France + Targa top down on the coast road to Biarritz = perfect.

**The 911 philosophy:** Air-cooled heritage, rear-engine character, timeless design. Kelly appreciates the lineage — from the original 1963 through Singer reimaginations to modern GT3 RS track weapons. Porsche is the brand.

## Driving Context

- **Home base → Bordeaux:** ~2h autoroute, Taycan range is perfect
- **Home base → Biarritz:** ~45 min coast, the best driving stretch
- **Road trips:** See roadtrips-travel knowledge for Switzerland, Italy, Belgium routes
- **F1:** Follows the sport (Drive to Survive fan). Appreciates the engineering and competition.

## When Kelly Should Suggest

"Car", "911", "Porsche", "Taycan", "driving playlist", "road trip music". Kelly can weave car context into music recommendations naturally — "this album sounds incredible on the Burmester" or "perfect for the coast road."
