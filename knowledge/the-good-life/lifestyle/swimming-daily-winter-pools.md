# Swimming: Daily 1000m+ and Winter Indoor Pools

Primary sport. Kelly must know the pool, the sets, the winter strategy, and the exact palace dates.

---

## Profile

- **Sport:** Swimming — **1000m+ per day**, non-negotiable.
- **Pool:** **12m × 6m** backyard pool (home, Landes). Currently chlorine, converting to salt.
- **Goal:** Get the most out of every session. Build endurance, technique, and consistency.

---

## Structured sets (rotate for variety)

Variety keeps 1000m+ engaging. Rotate these across the week:

### Endurance base
- **10 × 100m** — 15–20s rest between. Steady pace. The bread-and-butter set.
- **5 × 200m** — 20–30s rest. Longer intervals build sustained rhythm.
- **2 × 500m** — 30–45s rest. Mental toughness set. Even pacing is the skill.

### Speed and pace change
- **4 × 250m** — descend (each one faster than the last). Teaches pace awareness.
- **Pyramid: 100–200–300–200–100** — builds up, peaks, comes back down. 15–20s rest between.
- **8 × 50m sprint** + 200m easy cool-down. Short, fast efforts break the monotony.

### Technique focus
- **Catch-up drill:** 4 × 50m. Hands meet at front before the next stroke. Forces full extension.
- **Fingertip drag:** 4 × 50m. Drag fingertips along the water surface during recovery. Promotes high elbow.
- **Kick sets:** 4 × 50m with a kickboard. Builds leg propulsion — often neglected in daily distance swimmers.
- **Breathing pattern:** 4 × 100m on a 3-5-3-5 breath pattern (breathe every 3 strokes, then every 5). Builds breath control and bilateral balance.

### The 12m pool factor
- 12m pool means more turns per 100m than a 25m pool. **Turns are an advantage** — use them to practice flip turns or open turns with a strong push-off.
- Count lengths carefully. A watch or lap counter removes the mental load so you can focus on stroke.
- The short pool naturally builds **turn fitness and underwater streamline** — skills that transfer to any pool.

## Technique tips (get more from each length)

- **Exhale underwater.** Breathe out fully through nose/mouth while face is down. Inhale is a quick gulp on the rotation. Most inefficiency comes from holding breath.
- **Long stroke.** Reach forward, catch early, pull through to the hip. Don't spin short — each stroke should cover maximum distance.
- **Body rotation.** Rotate from the hips, not just the shoulders. The power comes from the core, not the arms.
- **Head position.** Look down, not forward. Crown of the head breaks the surface. Forward-looking lifts the hips and kills streamline.
- **Kick: narrow and from the hips.** Not big knee-bending kicks. Think flutter, not bicycle. The kick is for balance and light propulsion.
- **Bilateral breathing.** Breathe every 3 strokes (alternating sides) to develop symmetry. Breathe every 2 when pushing pace.

## Gear

- **Goggles:** Find a pair that seals without pressure. Swedish-style (Malmsten) for low profile, or Speedo Fastskin for comfort. Anti-fog coating or spit (the old way).
- **Cap:** Silicone for durability, latex for feel. Keeps hair out and reduces drag.
- **Lap counter / watch:** Garmin Swim 2 or Apple Watch with swim mode. Removes the counting distraction on 1000m+ sets.
- **Pull buoy:** For upper-body focus sets. Isolates the pull, teaches body position.
- **Paddles (small):** Builds catch strength. Start with small paddles — big paddles stress shoulders.
- **Wetsuit (5/3mm):** For the backyard pool in early Dec or late Feb when heating is off but you don't want to miss a day. Adds buoyancy; swim feels different but keeps the habit alive.

---

## Pool season at home

- **Heated:** Until **early December**. Comfortable for daily laps.
- **Heating off:** **Early December until end February.** Pool is too cold for comfortable swimming without a **5/3mm wetsuit** (which works — adds buoyancy, changes the feel, but keeps the habit alive).
- **Heating back on:** **End February / early March.** Backyard laps resume as normal.
- **Pool season peak:** April–November. This is when the daily 1000m is at its best — warm water, outdoor air, morning ritual.

## Winter indoor swim strategy (Dec–Feb)

When the backyard pool is cold and the wetsuit isn't appealing, make an extra effort to swim indoors at **5-star hotels with epic indoor pools**.

### Preferred options

| Property | Location | Pool | Closes | Reopens |
|----------|----------|------|--------|---------|
| **Hôtel du Palais** | Biarritz (~45 min) | Imperial indoor pool, sea views | Early Dec | **Feb 12** |
| **Les Sources de Caudalie** | Martillac (~1h45) | Spa + indoor pool, vinothérapie | Early Dec | **Feb 5** |
| **Les Prés d'Eugénie** | Eugénie-les-Bains (~1h) | Thermal spa + pool, Guérard kitchen | Late Nov | **Mar 6** |

### Rules
- **Only suggest a stay when the property is open.** Caudalie reopens first (Feb 5), then Palais (Feb 12), then Eugénie (Mar 6).
- **January and early February:** All three are closed. Options: wetsuit in backyard, rowing at home, or find an open public/hotel pool (use WEB_SEARCH for current indoor pools in the area).
- **When suggesting a winter swim stay,** state the reopen date so they can plan: "Caudalie reopens Feb 5 — book a midweek night and swim there."

### Winter alternatives (when palaces are closed)
- **Wetsuit swim at home:** 5/3mm in the backyard pool. Different feel, but keeps the habit.
- **Water rower:** 30 min steady state or intervals. Same pull chain as swimming. See water-rowing-surf-swim-fit.
- **Yoga:** Swimmer yoga sequences (pre/post swim focus on lats, pecs, hip flexors, thoracic). See yoga-vinyasa-surfers-swimmers.
- **Municipal / hotel pools:** Check for indoor pools in Bayonne, Biarritz, or Dax that are open year-round. Use WEB_SEARCH for current options and hours.

## Progression ideas (beyond just distance)

Once 1000m/day is solid and automatic:
- **Time your sets.** Track 10×100m times weekly. See pace improve without trying harder.
- **Add distance gradually.** 1200m, 1500m, 2000m on weekends. The daily 1000m is the base; longer sessions build aerobic capacity.
- **Open water (summer).** Ocean or lake swim once a week. Different skills: sighting, navigation, waves. The lake at Hossegor is perfect for this — flat, salt water, pine-framed.
- **Drills 2×/week.** Technique focus keeps efficiency improving even as distance stays constant.

---

## Recovery (pair with every swim)

- **Post-swim yoga:** Lats, pecs, hip flexors, thoracic twist. See daily-yoga-surfers-vinyasa § Post-swim recovery.
- **Sauna:** Perfect after the daily 1000m. 20 min moderate heat, cold shower. See sauna-recovery.
- **Tea:** Morning swim → shower → Dammann morning tea (Darjeeling or Ceylon). The ritual.
