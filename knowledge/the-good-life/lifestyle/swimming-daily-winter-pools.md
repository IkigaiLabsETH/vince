# Swimming: Daily 1000m+ and Winter Indoor Pools

Use this for the human's primary sport (swimming), backyard pool season, and winter indoor swim strategy at 5-star palaces. Kelly must know exact close/reopen dates for those hotels.

---

## User's swimming profile

- **Number one sport:** Swimming **1000m+ per day** in the **backyard pool**.
- **Pool:** **12m x 6m** (at home).
- **Goal:** They want **tips to get the most out of** this daily passion.

---

## Tips to get the most out of daily 1000m+

- **Consistency:** Same daily slot (e.g. morning or post-work) so it becomes non-negotiable.
- **Variety of sets:** Rotate 10×100, 5×200, 2×500, or 4×250 to keep it engaging and work different paces.
- **Recovery:** Swimmer yoga pre/post (see yoga-vinyasa-surfers-swimmers): pre-swim chest/thoracic/shoulders; post-swim lats, pecs, hip flexors, thoracic twist.
- **Hydration and light nutrition:** Sip before/after; light snack if swimming early.
- **Gear:** Cap and goggles that fit; lap counting or watch for 1000m+ so they can track without losing count.
- **Breath and technique:** Occasional focus on exhale rhythm and pull technique to make each length count.

---

## Pool season at home

- **Heated pool:** Used **until early December**.
- **Heating off:** **Early December until end February** — pool too cold for comfortable lap swimming unless using a **5/3 mm wetsuit** (which they consider).
- From **end February** heating can go back on; backyard laps resume as usual.

---

## Winter indoor swim strategy

- During the **early Dec–end Feb** gap, make an **extra effort to swim indoors** at **5-star hotels with epic indoor pools**.
- **Preferred options:** **Hôtel du Palais** (Biarritz), **Les Sources de Caudalie** (Martillac). Also **Les Prés d'Eugénie** (Eugénie-les-Bains) for gastronomy + pool.
- **Limitation:** These palaces **close in winter**. Kelly must know **exactly when they close and reopen** and only suggest stays when the property is open.
- **Water rower at home:** Ideal gym-season cardio and surf/swim fit when the pool is cold or they want variety; see lifestyle/water-rowing-surf-swim-fit.

## Exact close and reopen dates (single source)

| Property | Closes | Reopens |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Hôtel du Palais** (Biarritz) | Early December | **Feb 12** |
| **Les Sources de Caudalie** (Martillac) | Early December | **Feb 5** |
| **Les Prés d'Eugénie** (Eugénie-les-Bains) | Late November | **Mar 6** |

- When suggesting **winter indoor swim**, only recommend stays **from the reopen date until they close again** (early Dec). Do not suggest Palais or Caudalie for swim stays in Jan or early Feb — they are closed.
- **Caudalie** reopens first (Feb 5); **Palais** reopens Feb 12. Plan winter swim getaways accordingly.
- See **curated-open-schedule** for the same dates and for winter alternatives (open year-round) when palaces are closed.
