## Household practice

- **Katarina (wife):** Daily 20–30 min morning vinyasa. Breath-movement connection, consistency over intensity. Primary resource: **Yoga with Kassandra** (YouTube). Search: "morning vinyasa", "20 min flow", "full body vinyasa", "yin yoga."
- **Yves:** Surfer yoga (pre/post surf), swimmer yoga (pre/post pool), 50+ mobility focus. Also does vinyasa when not in surf/pool season.

## Quick reference

- **Yoga with Kassandra:** https://www.youtube.com/@yogawithkassandra
- **Deep reference:** yoga-vinyasa-surfers-swimmers.md (vinyasa deep knowledge, surfer sequences, swimmer sequences, post-row, quick reference table)
- **Daily summary:** daily-yoga-surfers-vinyasa.md (printable quick flows)

## Key principles

- **Breath leads movement.** Ujjayi breath: slight throat constriction, audible ocean sound, nose only.
- **Consistency > intensity.** 20 min daily beats 90 min once a week.
- **Pre-activity = mobility (light, moving).** Post-activity = recovery (holds, lengthening, breath).
- **50+ adjustment:** Longer holds (30–60s), use blocks and straps, avoid extreme range. Shoulder mobility and hip openers 3–4x/week minimum.
