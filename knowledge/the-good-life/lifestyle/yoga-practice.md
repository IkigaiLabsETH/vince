## Philosophy Notes

From looksmaxxing.md:
> "Movement, sunlight, cold water... Win the morning, win the day."

Yoga is not separate from the training protocol - it's the connective tissue that makes everything else sustainable. The 50+ body needs daily mobility work to maintain the capacity for hill sprints, heavy carries, and swimming.

**Remember:**
- Consistency over intensity
- Recovery enables performance
- Movement is medicine
- The best practice is the one you'll do every day
