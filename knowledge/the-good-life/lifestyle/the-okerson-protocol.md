# The Okerson Protocol (Adapted for Yves)

## Core Philosophy: "Movement Is Medicine, Stress Is Poison"

Four non-negotiable pillars:
1. **Daily low-impact, high-resistance movement** (Water Rower, weights, swimming)
2. **Ruthless protection of sleep and recovery** (70% of results)
3. **Nature as the ultimate gym** (walks, pool, outdoor time)
4. **Food as fuel, not dogma** (whole foods, no processed garbage)

**Extra focus on:**
- Water Rower (increase volume to compensate for no swimming)
- Yoga (daily during winter months)
- Long walks (bundle up, get outdoors anyway)

**Preferred Spas (check seasonal openings):**
- Les Sources de Caudalie (reopens Feb 5)

- 2-3 min float + nasal breathing recovery

### 3. Play Day (Active Recovery)
