# Home Cooking Equipment & Ideas

Quick meal ideas for evenings at home, organized by cooking equipment.

## Your human's home cooking setup

- **Green Egg–style kamado** at home; motivated to use it **at least once a week** and to get good at it.

- They **love dishes that sit in the oven a long time** (braises, pot roasts, confit, slow roasts).
- **High-quality local meat** is available; suggestions should assume good product.
