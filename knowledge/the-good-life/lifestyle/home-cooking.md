# Home Cooking — Dinner at Home

Dinner is almost always at home. The kitchen has serious tools and access to serious ingredients. Kelly suggests home cooking for "dinner ideas", "what to cook", "BBQ", "Thermomix", "something in the oven" — only suggest going out for dinner if they explicitly ask.

---

## The kitchen

- **Green Egg–style kamado** — the outdoor kitchen anchor. Goal: use at least once a week and get really good at it.
- **Thermomix TM7** — for dishes that are genuinely hard or tedious without it.
- **Oven** — long cooks are a love language. Braises, pot roasts, confit.
- **Local meat** — poulet fermier des Landes (yellow-skinned free-range), duck (magret, confit, foie gras), Bazas beef, local pork, Bayonne ham. The Saturday market at Hossegor is how you stock the kitchen. See hossegor-local.

## Green Egg BBQ

Ceramic kamado: smoking, grilling, roasting, baking. The most versatile outdoor cooker.

### Getting good at it

**Temperature control is everything.** The kamado holds temp by controlling airflow — bottom vent (draft door) and top vent (daisy wheel). Learn to set and hold 110°C (low-and-slow), 175°C (indirect roasting), and 350°C+ (pizza, searing).

**Charcoal:** Lump hardwood charcoal only (no briquettes). Oak, beech, or fruit woods from local producers. Light with a chimney starter or natural fire starters — never lighter fluid.

**Wood chips/chunks:** Hickory (classic smoke), cherry (sweet, mild), apple (light, fruity), oak (versatile). Soak chunks for 30 min before adding to extend smoke time.

### The repertoire (one per week minimum)

**Quick grills (30 min or less):**

- **Reverse sear côte de bœuf:** Low at 110°C until internal 45°C, then sear on screaming-hot grate. Salt, pepper, nothing else. The best steak method.
- **Smash burgers:** Cast iron on the grate, maximum heat. 2-minute smash. Local ground beef, brioche bun, simple toppings.
- **Grilled vegetables:** Zucchini, peppers, asparagus, eggplant — olive oil, salt, high heat. Char is the point.
- **Grilled fish:** Whole dorade or bar from the market. Olive oil, lemon, herbs. 8–10 min per side on medium heat.
- **Lamb chops:** Direct heat, 3–4 min per side. Rosemary, garlic, done.

**Low-and-slow (plan ahead):**

- **Ribs:** 4–6 hours at 110°C with hickory or cherry. Wrap in foil at the stall (around 70°C internal). Fall-off-the-bone.
- **Pulled pork (shoulder):** 8–10 hours at 110°C. Start in the morning for dinner. The kamado is perfect for this — set the vents and walk away.
- **Brisket:** The ultimate low-and-slow challenge. 10–14 hours at 110°C. Fat cap up. Texas-style: salt and pepper only.
- **Beer-can chicken:** Indirect at 175°C for 1.5 hours. Crispy skin, juicy meat. Easy crowd-pleaser.
- **Smoked duck breast:** 45 min at 120°C with cherry wood. Finish with a quick sear. Pairs with the Bordeaux in the cellar.
- **Smoked salmon:** Cold smoke for 2–3 hours. Cure with salt and sugar 24h before. The home version is better than anything you can buy.

**Pizza mode (350°C+):**

- Heat the Egg to 350°C+ with a pizza stone. 90-second Neapolitan pizza. San Marzano sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil. The kids love this.

### Green Egg + wine pairing

- **Ribs / pulled pork:** Madiran (Montus, Bouscassé) or Cahors — tannic, powerful, matches the smoke.
- **Côte de bœuf:** Margaux or Saint-Julien — elegant structure for the sear.
- **Grilled fish:** Chablis or Pessac-Léognan blanc — mineral, clean.
- **Pizza:** Rosé (Provence) or a light Beaujolais (Fleurie, Morgon).
- **Smoked duck:** Saint-Émilion or Pomerol — fruit and richness match the smoke.

## Thermomix TM7

The most versatile kitchen tool. Precise temperature, continuous stirring, blending, steaming, kneading. For "get the most out of the TM7," suggest dishes from **hard without Thermomix** below.

### Dishes that are genuinely hard without it

These reward precise temp control and continuous hands-free action:

- **Emulsifications:** Hollandaise, béarnaise, beurre blanc, mayo — precise 70–80°C + continuous blending. No splitting.
- **Custards and creams:** Crème anglaise, pastry cream (crème pâtissière), crème brûlée base, chocolate ganache — exact temp prevents scrambling.
- **Risotto (hands-free):** Add stock, rice, aromatics. Set to 100°C, reverse speed, 25 min. Walk away. Perfect al dente every time.
- **Polenta:** 30 min, continuous stir, no lumps. Impossible to achieve by hand without constant attention.
- **Ragù / bolognese (2h):** Low temp, automatic stirring. Deep, reduced, rich. The TM7 version is better than stovetop because the stir never stops.
- **Smooth soups and purées:** Cook and blend in one step. Silky vegetable soups (butternut, cauliflower, leek), nut butters, nut milks.
- **Bread and pasta dough:** Kneading in 3 minutes. Consistent, no mess. Fresh pasta from flour to ready-to-roll in 10 min.
- **Steamed fish + vegetables:** Multi-level Varoma steaming — protein on top, vegetables below. Healthy, fast, no added fat.
- **Sous-vide style eggs:** Precise 63°C for 45 min = perfect soft-set eggs. No sous-vide machine needed.

### Quick wins (under 30 min)

- Risotto (25 min), fresh pasta dough (10 min), soup & blend (20 min), steamed fish + veggies (15 min), hummus (3 min), cauliflower mash (15 min).

### Weekend projects

- Bread dough (knead + prove), slow ragù (2h), Thai curry paste (fresh aromatics), croissant dough (laminated — TM7 handles the détrempe).

## Long Oven Cooks

The dishes that sit in the oven for 2–4+ hours and fill the house with smell. Suggest when they want comfort, ease, or "something in the oven all afternoon."

### The repertoire

- **Beef bourguignon:** Red wine, lardons, mushrooms, pearl onions. 3 hours at 160°C. The canonical French braise.
- **Osso buco:** Veal shanks, white wine, gremolata. 2.5 hours at 160°C. Rich, gelatinous, deeply satisfying.
- **Coq au vin:** Chicken, Burgundy wine, lardons, mushrooms. 2 hours at 160°C. Classic.
- **Lamb shanks:** Red wine or beer, root veg, rosemary. 3 hours at 150°C. Fall-off-the-bone.
- **Pot roast (beef or lamb shoulder):** Sear, deglaze, slow-roast 3–4h at 140°C. One pot, minimal effort after assembly.
- **Porchetta-style pork:** Skin-on, fennel, garlic, rolled and tied. 3h at 160°C then blast at 230°C for crackling.
- **Duck confit:** Slow-cooked in its own fat. 2.5h at 140°C. Crisp the skin under the broiler before serving.
- **Slow-roasted tomatoes:** Halved, olive oil, garlic, thyme. 3h at 120°C. Use on everything for a week.
- **Baked beans (from scratch):** Dried beans, tomato, molasses, bacon. 4h at 140°C. Nothing like canned.

### Oven + wine pairing

- **Bourguignon / coq au vin:** Red Burgundy (Volnay, Gevrey-Chambertin). Cook with good wine, drink better wine.
- **Osso buco:** Crozes-Hermitage or Northern Rhône — structure and spice.
- **Lamb shanks:** Châteauneuf-du-Pape or Madiran — bold enough to match.
- **Duck confit:** Cahors or Saint-Émilion — fruit and tannin with the fat.

## Quick dinners (when there's no time)

- **Sheet pan:** Roast chicken + root veg (1h at 200°C), salmon + asparagus (15 min), sausages + peppers (25 min).
- **Pasta:** Fresh TM7 dough + quick sauce (cacio e pepe, aglio olio, pesto).
- **Steak:** Pan-seared magret de canard (duck breast), 4 min per side, rest, slice. Pink in the middle. Serve with baked potatoes or the TM7 cauliflower mash.

## Seasonal suggestions

| Season     | What to cook                                                  | Why                                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Spring** | Grilled asparagus (Green Egg), lamb (Easter), first rosé      | White asparagus from the Landes market. First outdoor grills of the year.      |
| **Summer** | Green Egg every week: ribs, fish, pizza. Salads, grilled veg. | Warm evenings, outdoor cooking, aperitif on the terrace.                       |
| **Autumn** | Bourguignon, pot roasts, cèpe mushrooms, duck confit          | Comfort season. Market has cèpes (Oct–Nov), duck, game.                        |
| **Winter** | Long oven cooks, TM7 soups, smoked duck, raclette nights      | Cozy. The oven and TM7 are the stars. Green Egg less frequent but still works. |

## When Kelly should suggest home cooking

**Triggers:** "What to cook", "dinner idea", "Green Egg", "BBQ", "Thermomix", "something in the oven", "dinner at home", "what to do with the [ingredient]."

**Default:** Dinner is home. Green Egg if the weather allows (or even if it doesn't — the kamado works in rain). Thermomix for the clever stuff. Oven for the slow stuff. Pair with wine from the cellar.
