# Home Cooking Equipment & Ideas

Quick meal ideas for evenings at home, organized by cooking equipment.

## Your human's home cooking setup

- **Green Egg–style kamado** at home; motivated to use it **at least once a week** and to get good at it.
- **Thermomix TM7**; they want to get the most out of it with dishes that are **really hard to make without it**.
- They **love dishes that sit in the oven a long time** (braises, pot roasts, confit, slow roasts).
- **High-quality local meat** is available; suggestions should assume good product.

## Thermomix TM7 (Priority)

The Thermomix TM7 is the most versatile - hands-free cooking with precise temperature control. For "get the most out of the TM7," suggest dishes from **Dishes that are hard without Thermomix** below.

### Dishes that are hard without Thermomix

These reward the TM7's precise temp and continuous blending; suggest when they ask for Thermomix ideas.

- **Emulsifications:** Hollandaise, béarnaise, beurre blanc, mayo—precise temp and continuous blending.
- **Precise low-temp:** Custards, crème anglaise, chocolate ganache, sous-vide–style eggs.
- **Long stirred / hands-free:** Risotto, polenta, ragù (2 h bolognese), porridge—set and forget.
- **Steamed layers:** Fish + veggies in one go; dim sum–style.
- **Smooth purées and soups:** Silky vegetable soups, nut butters, nut milks.
- **Dough and batters:** Pasta dough, bread dough, cake batters—one bowl, no mess.

### Quick Wins (Under 30 min)
- **Risotto Mode**: Hands-free risotto - add ingredients and walk away (25 min)
- **Fresh Pasta Dough**: From flour to ready-to-roll in 10 minutes
- **Soup & Blend**: Chop, cook, and blend in one pot (20 min)
- **Steamed Fish + Veggies**: Multi-level steaming - protein on top, vegetables below
- **Homemade Hummus**: Restaurant-quality in 3 minutes
- **Cauliflower Mash**: Low-carb side dish, perfectly smooth (15 min)

### Weekend Projects
- **Bread Dough**: Knead and prove for fresh bread
- **Slow-Cook Ragù**: 2-hour bolognese with automatic stirring
- **Thai Curry Paste**: Fresh aromatics blitzed to perfection

## Green Egg BBQ

The Big Green Egg - ceramic kamado for smoking, grilling, and baking.

- **Goal:** Use at least once a week; get good at low-and-slow, reverse sear, and smoking.
- **Quality meat:** Reverse-sear ribeye or côte de bœuf, smoked brisket, pork shoulder, ribs; beer-can chicken; Neapolitan pizza at 350 °C+.
- **When to suggest:** "What to cook this weekend," "BBQ ideas," "something on the kamado."

### Grilling (Quick)
- **Reverse Sear Ribeye**: Low at 110°C, then sear at max heat
- **Smash Burgers**: Cast iron on the grate, maximum heat
- **Grilled Vegetables**: Zucchini, peppers, asparagus with olive oil

### Smoking (Plan Ahead)
- **Low & Slow Ribs**: 4-6 hours at 110°C with hickory
- **Smoked Salmon**: Cold smoke for 2-3 hours
- **Pulled Pork**: 8-10 hours at 110°C - start morning for dinner
- **Beer Can Chicken**: Indirect at 175°C for 1.5 hours

### Pizza Mode
- **Neapolitan Pizza**: Heat to 350°C+, 90-second cook time

## Oven Recipes

Classic oven cooking for reliable results.

### Long oven cooks (they love these)

2–4+ hours low and slow; suggest when they ask for "dinner at home," "something in the oven all afternoon," or "comfort food."

- **Braisés:** Beef bourguignon, osso buco, coq au vin, lamb shanks—2–4 h low and slow.
- **Pot roast / slow roast:** Beef or lamb shoulder, porchetta-style pork.
- **Confit:** Duck confit, slow-cooked in fat.
- **Vegetables:** Slow-roasted tomatoes, onions, garlic; baked beans; grain bakes (farro, barley).

### Sheet Pan Dinners (Minimal Cleanup)
- **Roast Chicken + Root Vegetables**: 1 hour at 200°C
- **Salmon + Asparagus**: 15 min at 200°C
- **Sausages + Peppers**: 25 min at 200°C

### Casseroles & Bakes
- **Lasagna**: Classic comfort, prep and forget
- **Shepherd's Pie**: Ground lamb with mashed potato top
- **Baked Mac & Cheese**: Creamy with breadcrumb crust
