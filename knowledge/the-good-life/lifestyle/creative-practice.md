# Creative Practice — Overview & Routing

Five creative disciplines, each with its own deep knowledge file. Kelly suggests creative sessions as rebalance moves and gives concrete tips from the right doc.

---

## The five disciplines

### 1. Oil painting (canvas)
**Goal:** Start painting with oil on canvas. Get good. Make it a regular practice.
**Setup:** Limited palette (titanium white, ultramarine blue, burnt sienna, yellow ochre, cadmium red), brushes, canvas, easel. Odorless mineral spirit. Glass palette.
**The habit:** 20–30 min daily studies. One serious painting per week.
**Deep knowledge:** creative-production/oil-painting (materials, 4-phase learning path, masters to study, SW France context).
**Rebalance angle:** "Set up a still life and paint for an hour. No screens, no sound, just the canvas."

### 2. Photography (film + digital)
**Goal:** Shoot more. Hasselblad for deliberate medium format (film + digital back), Fuji for creative slow shutter.
**Setup:**
- **Hasselblad H2** — medium format film. 120 film, 645 format. Manual, deliberate, 16 frames per roll.
- **Hasselblad 555 ELD** — V-system body + digital back (coming). Zeiss glass with digital convenience. Tethered to Capture One.
- **Fuji** — slow shutter creative work. ND filters, tripod, intentional motion blur.
- **Capture One Pro** — the grading and editing tool for both systems. Sessions, tethered capture, color balance, layers.
**The habit:** One shoot per week — even if it's just 30 min with available light at home.
**Deep knowledge:** creative-production/hasselblad-fuji-capture-one, capture-one-pro.
**Rebalance angle:** "Grab the Fuji and walk. The light in the forest right now is incredible."

### 3. House music production
**Goal:** Dedicate time again. Make house music. Leverage AI/MCP to augment the workflow.
**Setup:** Ableton Live + Push 3. Standalone for sketching, controller mode for full production. CV/gate for modular. Denon DJ + Bose for mixing/listening.
**The habit:** Two sessions per week. One for producing (Ableton), one for listening/mixing (Denon DJ).
**Deep knowledge:** creative-production/ableton-push-3 (Push 3 capabilities, house music workflow, AI/MCP integration, learning path).
**Rebalance angle:** "Push 3 and an hour. Make a loop. See where it goes."

### 4. Cinema / video
**Goal:** Shoot and edit cinematic content. Learn color grading properly.
**Setup:**
- **BMPCC 6K** (Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K) — Super 35, BRAW, compact cinema.
- **IRIX lenses:** 15mm (ultra-wide), 45mm T1.5 (fast standard), 150mm T3.0 (telephoto).
- **DaVinci Resolve** — edit, color grade, VFX, audio, deliver. All in one.
**The habit:** Plan one short shoot per month. Grade everything — grading practice is the fastest way to develop an eye.
**Deep knowledge:** creative-production/blackmagic-design (BMPCC 6K, IRIX lenses, BRAW workflow), davinci-resolve (pages, color grading, BRAW pipeline, learning path).
**Rebalance angle:** "Take the BMPCC and the 45mm. Shoot 5 minutes of something beautiful. Grade it tonight."

### 5. 3D / Blender + Claude MCP
**Goal:** Integrate Claude Desktop with Blender via MCP server. Drive 3D from natural language.
**Setup:** Blender (free), MCP server (local), Claude Desktop App. Architecture: Claude → MCP server → Blender's Python API (bpy).
**The habit:** Experimental — set up the pipeline, then explore.
**Deep knowledge:** creative-production/blender-claude-mcp (architecture, tool set, setup steps, creative workflows).
**Rebalance angle:** "Open Blender and ask Claude to build something. See what happens."

## The studio build (future home for all of this)

**85 sqm multi-purpose studio** — not yet built, but planned. See home-and-spaces.
- Photography studio (Hasselblad tethered, controlled lighting)
- Yoga loft (daily vinyasa, Kassandra)
- Music production corner (Push 3, monitors, Denon DJ)
- Home office (deep work)
- Guest house (flexible)

Until the studio is built: work with what's available — natural light for photography, the house for painting, headphones for music, laptop for Resolve.

## When Kelly should suggest creative practice

**Triggers:** "creative tips", "painting", "photography", "Hasselblad", "Fuji", "Capture One", "Ableton", "Push 3", "house music", "Blackmagic", "BMPCC", "Resolve", "IRIX", "Blender", "Claude MCP", "I need to make something."

**As rebalance:** Creative sessions are a screen-free (painting, photography) or screen-different (music, cinema, Blender) way to reset after a grind session. Kelly weaves creative suggestions into touch-grass/rebalance recommendations naturally.

**Voice:** Concrete tips, not theory. "Start with a limited palette and a grisaille" not "consider exploring different painting techniques." Reference the specific tools they own. Link to the deep knowledge file for more.
