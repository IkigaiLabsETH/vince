# Coffee & the Sage

Coffee is the morning ritual. The Sage fires up before the swim — espresso pulled, flat white poured, day begins. Evening belongs to Dammann Frères; morning belongs to coffee.

## The Machine: Sage

Sage (Breville in the US/AU) — serious home espresso. Not pod machines, not drip. Real extraction, real grinder, real steam.

### Models Worth Knowing

- **The Barista Express** — built-in conical burr grinder, 54mm portafilter. The popular entry point. Manual milk texturing. Does 90% of what most people need.
- **The Barista Pro** — same footprint, faster 3-second heat-up via ThermoJet. Digital temperature control. Better grinder adjustment.
- **The Barista Touch** — touchscreen interface, automated milk texturing. Preset drink recipes. Convenient but less hands-on.
- **The Oracle Touch** — dual boiler, auto grind-dose-tamp, automated milk. The "do everything" machine. Top of the line.
- **The Dual Boiler** — the enthusiast's choice. 58mm portafilter, PID on both boilers, shot timer, pre-infusion control. Manual everything. For people who want to dial in.

### Key Specs

- **Portafilter:** 54mm (Barista line) or 58mm (Oracle / Dual Boiler). 58mm = industry standard, more basket options.
- **PID temperature control** — precise to ±1°C. Essential for consistency.
- **Dose control grinding** — adjustable grind size and dose. Built-in on all models.
- **Pre-infusion** — low-pressure soak before full extraction. Reduces channeling.
- **Steam wand** — single-hole on Express, more powerful on Pro and above. Oracle/Dual Boiler have commercial-style wands.

## Bean Origins & Profiles

### Africa

- **Ethiopia** — the birthplace. Two distinct profiles depending on processing:
  - *Natural (dry) process:* fruity, wine-like, blueberry, strawberry. Bold, complex.
  - *Washed process:* tea-like, floral, jasmine, bergamot. Elegant, clean.
  - Key regions: **Yirgacheffe** (floral, delicate), **Sidamo** (berry, citrus), **Guji** (tropical, complex).
  - Best as: light-medium roast pour-over, or medium roast for a distinctive espresso.

- **Kenya** — bright, intense, unmistakable. Blackcurrant, grapefruit, tomato-like acidity. Full body despite the brightness. **AA grade** = largest bean size, typically best quality. SL-28 and SL-34 cultivars are iconic. Not subtle — Kenya punches.

- **Rwanda / Burundi** — emerging East African origins. Bright, complex, red fruit, floral. Similar character to Kenya but often softer acidity. Excellent value for African coffee quality.

### Central & South America

- **Colombia** — the reliable all-rounder. Balanced, caramel sweetness, nutty, bright but not aggressive acidity. **Huila** (fruity, complex), **Nariño** (bright, citrus), **Tolima** (chocolate, balanced). Works beautifully as espresso — forgiving and consistent.

- **Brazil** — the espresso backbone. Nutty, chocolate, low acidity, heavy body. **Santos** (classic, mild), **Cerrado** (full body, sweet). Most espresso blends use Brazil as the base — it provides body and crema without sharpness. Natural-processed Brazils add sweetness.

- **Guatemala** — chocolate, spice, brown sugar, full body. **Antigua** (volcanic soil, complex), **Huehuetenango** (fruity, high altitude). Excellent in milk drinks — the chocolate notes cut through.

- **Costa Rica** — clean, honey-sweet, bright acidity without harshness. **Tarrazú** region is the benchmark. Honey-processed Costa Ricans are exceptional — sticky sweetness, stone fruit.

### Asia & Islands

- **Indonesia** — earthy, herbal, full body, low acidity. **Sumatra Mandheling** (earthy, cedar, dark chocolate), **Java** (cleaner, more balanced). Wet-hulled processing gives the distinctive earthy character. Love-it-or-hate-it profile. Pairs well with dark roast.

- **Yemen** — the OG origin. Coffee's first export. Wild, fruity, winey, complex, chocolatey. Naturally processed, often irregular. Rare and expensive (€80-150/kg). Worth trying once. **Mocha** port gave its name to the chocolate-coffee drink.

- **Jamaica Blue Mountain** — smooth, mild, balanced, zero bitterness. Famous and expensive. Honestly? Often overhyped for the price. Pleasant but rarely complex enough to justify €100+/kg.

## Roast Levels

| Roast | Character | Best For | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Light** | Origin shines. Fruity, floral, bright acidity. | Pour-over, filter. Single-origin showcase. | Third-wave specialty preference. Can taste sour if under-extracted. Needs higher brew temp (94-96°C). |
| **Medium** | Balanced. Origin + roast character. Caramel, sweetness. | Most versatile. Espresso and filter. | The sweet spot for home espresso. Forgiving to brew. |
| **Medium-dark** | Chocolate, caramel, reduced acidity. Fuller body. | Milk drinks. Espresso blends. | Flat whites and cappuccinos love this roast. Hides origin but maximizes sweetness. |
| **Dark** | Smoky, bitter, oily, heavy body. Roast > origin. | Traditional Italian espresso. | Less origin character. Can taste burnt if overdone. Some people love it — no judgement. |

**For the Sage:** Medium to medium-dark is the daily sweet spot. Light roasts are rewarding but demand precise dialing-in.

## Espresso Technique

The Sage is capable of genuinely excellent espresso. The variables:

### The Recipe (Starting Point)

- **Dose:** 18-20g ground coffee (double basket)
- **Yield:** 36-40g liquid espresso (1:2 ratio)
- **Time:** 25-30 seconds from pump start
- **Temperature:** 93°C for medium roasts, 94-96°C for light, 91-92°C for dark

### Dialing In

- **Too fast (<20 sec):** Grind finer. Sour, thin, watery = under-extracted.
- **Too slow (>35 sec):** Grind coarser. Bitter, ashy, harsh = over-extracted.
- **Channeling** (uneven flow, spurting): Improve distribution. Use a WDT tool (toothpick in the basket, stir grounds). Tamp level.
- **Tamp:** Firm, level, consistent. ~15kg pressure. Don't overthink it — level matters more than force.

### Distribution (the Secret)

Most home espresso problems are distribution, not grind. The water finds the path of least resistance — if there's a gap, it channels through and over-extracts that spot while under-extracting the rest.

- **WDT tool:** Thin needle, stir grounds in basket before tamping. Game-changer.
- **Tap and settle:** Light tap on counter to collapse air pockets.
- **Leveling:** Finger-sweep or distribution tool before tamping.

## Drinks

### The Daily: Flat White

Double espresso (36-40g) + steamed milk with microfoam, ~150ml total. Silky, strong, milk enhances rather than masks the coffee. The Australian/NZ gift to coffee culture. **This is the morning drink.**

### The Rotation

- **Cortado** — espresso + equal part steamed milk (~60ml total). Quick, strong, Spanish. When you want coffee fast without dilution.
- **Cappuccino** — more foam than flat white, traditional 1:1:1 ratio (espresso:milk:foam). Morning drink in Italy (never after 11am, but ignore that rule).
- **Long black** — hot water first, double espresso poured on top (preserves crema). For when you want volume and time with the cup. Not the same as Americano (which pours water on espresso — kills the crema).
- **Latte** — more milk, gentler. ~240ml. Good with a vanilla or caramel syrup if you're in that mood.

### Milk Technique on the Sage

- **Start cold:** Fresh, cold full-fat milk. More fat = better texture.
- **Position:** Steam tip just below surface, slightly off-center to create a vortex.
- **Stretch:** First 2-3 seconds, lower the jug to introduce air (tss-tss sound). Just enough — flat white wants microfoam, not meringue.
- **Texture:** Raise jug so tip is submerged. Let it spin and heat. Stop at ~65°C (jug too hot to hold comfortably).
- **Pour:** Immediately. Tap jug to pop large bubbles, swirl, pour. Should look like wet paint.

## Brewing Beyond Espresso

### Pour-Over (V60 / Chemex)

Clean, bright, highlights origin character. The weekend ritual when you have time and good single-origin beans. 15g coffee, 250ml water, 3-minute brew. Medium-coarse grind. Blooming (initial pour, 30-sec wait) is essential.

### AeroPress

The travel companion. Versatile — can produce espresso-like concentrate or clean filter-style. Inverted method, fine-medium grind, 1-2 minute steep. Practically indestructible. Take it on trips.

### French Press

Full body, all the oils. 60g/L, coarse grind, 4-minute steep, plunge slowly. Simple and forgiving. Good for sharing — makes 3-4 cups easily.

### Cold Brew

Summer drink. Coarse grind, 1:8 ratio, steep 12-18 hours in fridge. Strain. Smooth, sweet, low acidity. Concentrate keeps 1-2 weeks refrigerated. Dilute with water or milk over ice.

## Water

Water is 98% of espresso. It matters enormously.

- **Target:** Filtered water, 100-150 TDS (total dissolved solids).
- **Too soft** (distilled, reverse osmosis) = flat, empty extraction. No minerals to bond with coffee compounds.
- **Too hard** (unfiltered tap in limestone areas) = scale buildup in the Sage + bitter, chalky taste.
- **Solution:** BWT or Brita filter jug. Or Third Wave Water mineral packets added to distilled water for perfect consistency.
- **Descale the Sage** regularly — every 2-3 months with the machine's descale cycle. Scale kills machines.

## Storage

- **Whole bean only.** Pre-ground goes stale in hours. The Sage has a grinder — use it.
- **Airtight container**, room temperature, away from sunlight. Fellow Atmos or Airscape are good.
- **Use within 2-4 weeks** of roast date. Peak flavor is typically days 7-21.
- **Don't freeze.** (Some experts disagree, but condensation on thaw damages the beans. Just buy fresh more often.)

## Specialty & Third Wave

- **Specialty coffee** = scored 80+ out of 100 by SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) certified graders. It's a real standard, not marketing.
- **Single-origin** = one farm, one region, one country. Best for pour-over and filter where you can taste the origin. Named by farm or washing station.
- **Blends** = multiple origins combined for balance and consistency. Best for espresso — the roaster can tune for sweetness, body, and crema across seasons.

### Finding Good Beans

Look for local specialty roasters in the Bordeaux / Biarritz / Pays Basque area. Farmers markets and specialty shops often carry local micro-roasters. Online, French roasters like Belleville, Lomi, or Coutume ship nationally.

Key label signals: roast date (not "best before"), origin details (farm/region, not just country), processing method, altitude.

## Morning Ritual

1. **Sage on.** Heat-up while getting ready.
2. **Grind, distribute, tamp.** 18g, WDT, level tamp.
3. **Pull the shot.** Watch for a steady, honey-like stream. 25-30 seconds.
4. **Steam milk.** Cold, full-fat, stretch then texture. Microfoam.
5. **Pour the flat white.** Drink it while it's hot.
6. **Swim.** The caffeine hits poolside.
7. **Evening:** Switch to Dammann Frères. No caffeine after ~2pm if sleep-sensitive.

## Quick Recommendations

- **Daily espresso/flat white:** Medium-roast Colombian or Brazilian blend. Consistent, forgiving, chocolatey with milk.
- **Weekend single-origin:** Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, washed, light-medium roast. Floral, bright, makes the flat white sing differently.
- **Dark roast craving:** Guatemalan Antigua or Indonesian Sumatra. Full body, chocolate, earthy.
- **Summer cold brew:** Brazilian natural process. Sweet, nutty, low acidity. Smooth over ice.
- **Impress a guest:** Kenyan AA, medium roast, as pour-over. Blackcurrant and grapefruit — unforgettable.
