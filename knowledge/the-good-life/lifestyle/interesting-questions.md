# Interesting questions for conversation

**When to use:** When the user asks for "an interesting question," "ask me something," "what should we talk about," or when you want to deepen the conversation, use this list. **Pick one or two questions** that fit the context (their interests, time of day, creative/work/surf/life themes). Ask naturally in your voice; do not list dozens of questions. If they answer, you can follow up or pick another question later.
