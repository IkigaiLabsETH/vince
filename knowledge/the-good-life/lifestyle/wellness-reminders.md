# Wellness Reminders

Quick wellness tips for the GN briefing - rotating reminders for mental health, sleep, meditation, yoga, and exercise.

## Mental Health

Short practices for mental clarity and emotional regulation.

- **5-min Journaling**: Write 3 things that went well today - ends the day on gratitude
- **Brain Dump**: Write everything on your mind, then close the notebook - externalize the thoughts
- **Gratitude Moment**: Name 3 specific good things from today, no matter how small
- **Tomorrow's Top 3**: Write down the 3 most important things for tomorrow - sleep with clarity

## Sleep Optimization

Evidence-based tips for better sleep quality.

- **No Screens 30 min Before Bed**: Blue light suppresses melatonin production
- **Cool Room (18-19°C)**: Core body temperature drop triggers sleep
- **Same Bedtime Daily**: Circadian rhythm thrives on consistency, even weekends
- **No Caffeine After 2pm**: Half-life of 5-6 hours means it's still in your system at bedtime
- **Magnesium Before Bed**: Natural muscle relaxant and sleep supporter
- **Dark Room**: Block all light sources - melatonin needs darkness

## Meditation

Quick practices for calm and focus.

- **5-min Body Scan**: Start at toes, move up to head, notice each area without judgment
- **Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)**: Inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s - activates parasympathetic
- **10 Deep Breaths**: Simple but effective - focus only on the breath
- **Loving-Kindness (3 min)**: Send well-wishes to yourself, someone you love, and someone neutral

## Yoga Flows

Short sequences for flexibility and recovery.

- **10-min Yin (Hips & Shoulders)**: Pigeon, thread the needle, seated twist - hold 2 min each
- **Legs Up the Wall (5 min)**: Passive inversion for leg recovery and calm
- **Cat-Cow + Child's Pose (5 min)**: Gentle spinal mobility before bed
- **Sun Salutation A (3 rounds)**: Full body activation in under 10 minutes
- **Forward Folds Only (5 min)**: Standing fold, seated fold, wide-leg fold - calms the nervous system

- 10 Bent-Over Rows

### Superset Circuit (15 min)

## Longevity and functional fitness

Principles for performing well for decades: mobile, flexible, strong—built for long-term activity, not bulk.

- **Functional fitness**: Stay mobile, flexible, and strong—built for decades of activity, not bulk. Favour movement quality and range over heavy lifting for size.
- **Daily stretching and movement**: Underpin long-term performance. Consistency beats intensity when the goal is longevity.
- **Morning ritual**: Warm lemon water first thing; then a solid breakfast or smoothie (fruit, protein, greens). When conditions are good, move first (swim, surf) then refuel.
- **Eight hours' sleep**: Cool, dark room; consistent bedtime. Recovery is when the body adapts.
- **Mental health as longevity**: Reflection, journaling, or professional support when needed—mental health is part of the long game.
- **Recovery and nutrition**: The base for long-term surfing, swimming, and activity. Listen to your body; experiment with what works and learn from it.
