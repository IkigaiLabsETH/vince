# Wellness Reminders

Quick wellness tips for the GN briefing - rotating reminders for mental health, sleep, meditation, yoga, and exercise.

## Mental Health

Short practices for mental clarity and emotional regulation.

- **5-min Journaling**: Write 3 things that went well today - ends the day on gratitude

- **Tomorrow's Top 3**: Write down the 3 most important things for tomorrow - sleep with clarity

## Sleep Optimization

Evidence-based tips for better sleep quality.

- **No Screens 30 min Before Bed**: Blue light suppresses melatonin production
- **Cool Room (18-19°C)**: Core body temperature drop triggers sleep

- **No Caffeine After 2pm**: Half-life of 5-6 hours means it's still in your system at bedtime
- **Magnesium Before Bed**: Natural muscle relaxant and sleep supporter
- **Dark Room**: Block all light sources - melatonin needs darkness

- **5-min Body Scan**: Start at toes, move up to head, notice each area without judgment
