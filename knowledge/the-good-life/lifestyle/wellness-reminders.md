# Wellness Reminders

Rotating tips for the daily briefing — mental health, sleep, movement, nutrition, and longevity. Kelly picks one or two relevant reminders per day based on context (time, season, recent activity).

---

## Sleep (the foundation)

- **Same bedtime daily** — circadian rhythm thrives on consistency, even weekends. Aim for 8 hours.
- **Cool room (18–19°C)** — core body temperature drop triggers sleep onset.
- **Dark room** — block all light. Melatonin needs darkness. Blackout curtains or eye mask.
- **No screens 30 min before bed** — blue light suppresses melatonin. Read, stretch, or sauna instead.
- **No caffeine after 14:00** — half-life of 5–6 hours means it's still active at bedtime.
- **Magnesium before bed** — glycinate or threonate. Natural muscle relaxant and sleep supporter.
- **Evening sauna (no cold after)** — the gradual cooling triggers melatonin. See sauna-recovery.
- **Evening tea** — Dammann caffeine-free (rooibos, herbal, fruit). Ritual signals wind-down.

## Mental health & clarity

- **5-min journaling:** Write 3 things that went well today. Ends the day on gratitude, not anxiety.
- **Brain dump:** Write everything on your mind, then close the notebook. Externalize the noise.
- **Tomorrow's top 3:** Write the 3 most important things for tomorrow. Sleep with clarity, not open loops.
- **10 deep breaths:** Simple but effective. Full inhale through nose, slow exhale through mouth. Activates parasympathetic.
- **Box breathing (4-4-4-4):** Inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s. Navy SEAL stress protocol. Works in 2 minutes.
- **Body scan (5 min):** Toes to head, notice each area without judgment. Grounding before sleep or after a long screen day.

## Movement (daily, non-negotiable)

### Pool season (Apr–Nov)

- **Morning swim (1000m+)** — the anchor. See swimming-daily-winter-pools for sets and tips.
- **Post-swim yoga** — lats, pecs, hip flexors, thoracic. 20 min. See daily-yoga-surfers-vinyasa.
- **Surf when it's on** — everything else waits. Pre-surf warm-up + post-surf recovery.
- **Evening:** Walk, stretch, or yin yoga.

### Gym season (Dec–Feb)

- **Rowing** — 30 min steady state or intervals. Indoor cardio that builds swim fitness. See water-rowing-surf-swim-fit.
- **Morning vinyasa** — 20–30 min with Kassandra. Maintains flexibility and breath.
- **Indoor swim** — palace pools (Caudalie from Feb 5, Palais from Feb 12) or wetsuit in the backyard.
- **Dumbbell circuit** — when energy is high and you want strength work.
- **Sauna** — especially valuable in winter. Post-activity or evening.

## Strength (minimal equipment, maximum function)

Goal: mobile, flexible, strong — built for decades of surf, swim, and life. Not bulk.

### 10-min AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)

- 10 goblet squats
- 10 push presses
- 10 bent-over rows

### Superset circuit (15 min)

- 3×10 goblet squats + shoulder press
- 3×10 Romanian deadlifts + bent-over rows
- 3×10 lunges + bicep curls

### Quick upper body (10 min)

- 3×12 floor press
- 3×12 bent-over rows
- 3×12 shoulder press
- 3×15 bicep curls

### Quick lower body (10 min)

- 3×15 goblet squats
- 3×12 Romanian deadlifts
- 3×10 lunges each leg
- 3×15 calf raises

## Nutrition principles

- **Morning ritual:** Warm lemon water first thing. Then solid breakfast or smoothie (fruit, protein, greens).
- **When conditions are good:** Move first (swim, surf), then refuel. Fasted morning movement is fine for 1000m.
- **Post-swim:** Protein within 30 min. Eggs, yogurt, smoothie — whatever is easy.
- **Hydration:** Water throughout the day. Electrolytes after swim or sauna (sodium, potassium, magnesium).
- **Local meat quality:** The Landes has exceptional poultry (poulet fermier), duck, and local beef. Use it — home cooking with quality product beats supplements.
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Omega-3 (fish, walnuts), turmeric, olive oil. The daily swim + diet combination is naturally anti-inflammatory.

## Longevity mindset

- **Functional fitness over aesthetics.** Stay mobile, flexible, and strong — built for decades of activity. Movement quality and range over heavy lifting for size.
- **Daily stretching and movement** underpin long-term performance. Consistency beats intensity when the goal is longevity.
- **8 hours sleep.** Recovery is when the body adapts. Non-negotiable.
- **Mental health is longevity.** Reflection, journaling, touch grass, creative practice — the mind needs maintenance too.
- **Recovery = nutrition + sleep + movement variety.** Listen to the body. Experiment with what works and learn from it.
- **The weekly audit:** Did I swim every day? Did I eat well? Did I sleep 8 hours? Did I step away from screens? If three of four are no — next week needs adjusting.

## Quick yoga flows (for the briefing)

- **10-min yin (hips & shoulders):** Pigeon, thread the needle, seated twist — hold 2 min each.
- **Legs up the wall (5 min):** Passive inversion for leg recovery and calm. Post-swim, post-row, or before bed.
- **Cat-cow + child's pose (5 min):** Gentle spinal mobility. Good for any time.
- **Sun Salutation A × 3 rounds:** Full body activation in under 10 minutes. Morning kickstart.
- **Forward folds only (5 min):** Standing fold, seated fold, wide-leg fold. Calms the nervous system.

See daily-yoga-surfers-vinyasa for full sequences.

## How Kelly uses this

Pick **one or two** reminders per daily briefing based on:

- **Time of day:** Morning = movement, nutrition. Evening = sleep, wind-down, sauna.
- **Season:** Pool season = swim-focused. Gym season = rowing, yoga, indoor swim, strength.
- **Recent context:** Been grinding → suggest recovery (sauna, yin, walk). Slept badly → sleep tips. Haven't moved → movement reminder.
- **Weather:** Rain/cold → indoor options (rowing, yoga, sauna, creative session). Beautiful day → pool, surf, walk.

Don't lecture. One concrete suggestion. "Post-swim sauna today — you've earned it" not "remember to prioritize your recovery."
