# Sauna & Recovery

Sauna is maintenance, not luxury. After swimming, surfing, rowing, or a day building — heat resets everything.

---

## Why sauna (evidence-backed)

- **Cardiovascular:** Regular sauna use (4–7×/week) associated with significantly lower cardiovascular mortality (Laukkanen et al., JAMA Internal Medicine, 2015). 20-year Finnish study, 2,315 men.
- **Recovery:** Increases blood flow, reduces delayed-onset muscle soreness, accelerates recovery from swimming/surf/rowing.
- **Sleep:** Evening sauna → body temperature drop after → deeper sleep onset. The rebound cooling effect is the mechanism.
- **Mental clarity:** Heat stress triggers endorphins and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). The "sauna high" is real and measurable.
- **Immune function:** Regular use increases white blood cell count and heat shock protein production.
- **Longevity:** One of the most consistently supported longevity interventions in research. Huberman, Attia, and Rhonda Patrick all converge here.
- **Growth hormone:** A single sauna session can increase growth hormone 2–5× baseline. Two sessions with a cool-down between can push it higher. Relevant for recovery and anti-aging.

## Protocols

### Standard session (the daily)

1. **Pre-heat:** 80–100°C (traditional Finnish range). Hotter is not always better — consistency and duration matter more than peak temperature.
2. **Duration:** 15–20 minutes per round.
3. **Rounds:** 2–3 rounds, with cool-down between each.
4. **Cool-down between rounds:** Cold shower (30–60s), cold plunge if available, or outdoor air (2–3 min). The contrast is where the cardiovascular benefit peaks.
5. **Hydrate:** Water + electrolytes before, during, and after. Sauna dehydrates fast — 0.5–1 liter of sweat per 20-min session.
6. **Total time:** 45–60 minutes including cool-downs and rest.

### Post-swim (after the daily 1000m)

- One longer session: 20 min at moderate heat (80–85°C).
- Cold shower after (60s).
- Perfect cap to the morning swim — loosens everything the water tightened, releases shoulders and lats.
- Pair with post-swim yoga (lats, pecs, hip flexors) if time allows.

### Post-surf (especially winter sessions)

- 15–20 min at 85–90°C. Rewarm the core after cold-water exposure.
- Cold shower optional (you've already been cold). Warm shower → sauna → done.
- Eliminates the "dead legs" feeling the next day.

### Post-rowing

- Same as post-swim. The rowing pull chain (lats, shoulders, hip flexors) benefits from heat.
- 15–20 min, moderate heat, one round is enough.

### Evening wind-down (for sleep)

- Lower temp: 75–80°C. Longer sit: 20–25 min.
- **No cold plunge after** if the goal is sleep — let the body cool naturally over 30–60 min. The gradual cooling triggers melatonin.
- Pair with evening tea (Dammann Frères caffeine-free — rooibos Earl Grey or tisane fleur d'oranger).
- This is the protocol for "can't sleep" or "wired from a long day."

### Weekend deep session (the Finnish way)

- 3 rounds: 20 min hot → 2 min cold (plunge or shower) → 10 min rest. Repeat.
- Total: ~90 min including rest periods.
- Social or solo. Follow with a light meal and wine.
- This is the full reset — reserve for weekends or days with nothing after.

## Contrast therapy (heat + cold)

The real magic is in the contrast — alternating hot and cold amplifies cardiovascular benefits, reduces inflammation, and triggers a deep parasympathetic response.

### Sauna + cold plunge

- **Hot:** 15–20 min at 85–95°C.
- **Cold:** 1–3 min at 5–15°C (cold plunge, ice bath, or very cold shower).
- **Repeat:** 2–3 rounds. End on cold if you want alertness; end on hot if you want relaxation/sleep.
- The cold doesn't need to be extreme — 10°C water for 2 min is plenty. Consistency matters more than suffering.

### Sauna + ocean (seasonal)

- In autumn/winter: surf or ocean swim → sauna. The ocean is the cold plunge.
- In summer: sauna → ocean dip. Quick contrast, then dry off in the sun.
- This is the Hossegor-native version of contrast therapy. No ice bath needed — you have the Atlantic.

### Without a plunge pool

- Cold shower works. Turn it fully cold for 60–90 seconds between sauna rounds.
- Outdoor air in winter (even standing outside for 2–3 min) creates meaningful contrast.

## Home setup considerations

- **Traditional Finnish sauna** (wood-fired or electric): 80–100°C, dry heat with occasional water on stones (löyly). The gold standard.
- **Infrared sauna:** Lower temps (50–65°C), deeper tissue penetration, less intense. Good for daily use, smaller space, lower energy. Not the same cardiovascular stimulus as traditional, but still beneficial.
- **Barrel sauna (outdoor):** Popular in SW France. Pine or cedar, fits a garden. Heats in 30–45 min. Beautiful in the Landes setting — pine forest, outdoor air between rounds.
- **Cold plunge:** A dedicated tub (5–15°C) or even a large stock tank with a chiller. The backyard pool in winter (unheated, Dec–Feb) is naturally cold enough to serve as a plunge.

## When Kelly should suggest sauna

**Triggers:** "recovery", "sore muscles", "can't sleep", "rest day", "rainy day", "what to do after swimming", "wind down", "cold day", "need to reset", or when the weather kills outdoor plans.

**Voice:** Weave it in naturally — sauna is part of the wellness stack alongside swimming, yoga, rowing, and tea. Not a big deal, not a prescription. Just: "Great day for a sauna session and a long oven cook" or "Post-swim: sauna, then that Rooibos Earl Grey."
