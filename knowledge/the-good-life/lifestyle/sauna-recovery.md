# Sauna & Recovery

## Why Sauna

Sauna is the counterweight to the grind. After swimming, surfing, working out, or just a long day building — heat resets everything. It's not luxury, it's maintenance.

**Benefits (evidence-backed):**
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular sauna use (4-7x/week) associated with significantly lower cardiovascular mortality (Laukkanen et al., JAMA Internal Medicine)
- **Recovery:** Increases blood flow, reduces muscle soreness post-workout, accelerates recovery from swimming/surf sessions
- **Sleep:** Evening sauna → body temperature drop after = deeper sleep onset
- **Mental clarity:** Heat stress triggers endorphins and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). The "sauna high" is real.
- **Immune function:** Regular use increases white blood cell count
- **Longevity:** One of the most consistently supported longevity interventions in research (Huberman, Attia, Rhonda Patrick all align here)

## Protocol

### Standard Session
1. **Pre-heat:** 80-100°C (traditional Finnish range). Hotter is not better — consistency matters more.
2. **Duration:** 15-20 minutes per round
3. **Rounds:** 2-3 rounds, with cool-down between
4. **Cool-down:** Cold shower, cold plunge if available, or just outdoor air. The contrast is where the magic happens.
5. **Hydrate:** Water + electrolytes. Sauna dehydrates fast.

### Post-Workout (after pool/swim/surf)
- One longer session (20 min) at moderate heat (80-85°C)
- Cold shower after
- Perfect after the daily 1000m swim — loosens everything the chlorine tightened

### Evening Wind-Down
- Lower temp (75-80°C), longer sit (20-25 min)
- No cold plunge after if the goal is sleep — let the body cool naturally
- Pair with evening tea (Dammann Frères caffeine-free — rooibos or herbal)

### Weekend Deep Session
- 3 rounds: 15 min hot → 2 min cold → 10 min rest, repeat
- The Finnish way. Social or solo.
- Follow with a light meal and wine

## Pairing with Kelly's World

- **After swimming:** Sauna is the perfect cap to the daily 1000m. Warm up, flush lactic acid, relax tight shoulders.
- **After surfing:** Especially winter sessions in wetsuits. Sauna + stretch = no stiffness the next day.
- **Rainy/cold day:** When the weather kills the outdoor plan, sauna becomes the anchor activity. "Great day for a sauna session and a long oven cook."
- **Evening ritual:** Sauna → cold shower → Dammann Frères evening tea → good sleep.
- **With guests:** Sauna + aperitif is a legit hosting move in SW France.
