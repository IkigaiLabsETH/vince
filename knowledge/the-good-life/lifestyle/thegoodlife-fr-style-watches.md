### Key trends from Fashion Week FW26/27
- **Classicism renewed**: Zegna, Lemaire, Armani, Brioni, Tod's all pushing refined tailoring with modern proportions (wider, softer, more relaxed cuts)

- **Ralph Lauren return**: Milan show reunited Polo + Purple Label. Americana/preppy heritage + vintage hunting.

### Expert advice (Sophie Jordan, Mytheresa Homme buying director)
