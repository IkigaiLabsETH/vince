## Support & Resistance

### The Golden Rules

1. **Support becomes resistance** (when broken)
2. **Resistance becomes support** (when broken)
3. **More touches = stronger level**
4. **Round numbers = psychological levels**

### Finding S/R

- Previous highs/lows
- Trendlines
- Moving averages
- Gap edges
- Round numbers

|----|-----|
| 9 | Fast, short-term |
| 20 | Short-term trend |

### Signals

- **Price < MA** = bearish
- **Golden Cross** (50 crosses above 200) = bullish
- **Death Cross** (50 crosses below 200) = bearish

## Volume

### The Volume Principle

> "Volume is the fuel that powers price."

**Rules:**

- Volume precedes price

---

## Indicators

| 30- | Oversold |
| 50 | Neutral |

**Best for:** Divergences

- Histogram

**Signals:**
