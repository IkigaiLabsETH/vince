# The Great Unbundling: Why Artificial Intelligence Will Destroy More Than It Creates (And Why That's Exactly What We Need)

*How the AI revolution mirrors crypto's creative destruction—and why the real winners won't be who you think*

---

Everyone's asking the wrong question about AI. Instead of "How will AI change everything?" we should be asking "What will AI destroy first?" Because destruction—not creation—is where the alpha lives.

The parallel to crypto is striking. In 2017, everyone saw blockchain as "the future of everything." Banks would be replaced. Governments would crumble. Decentralization would rule. What actually happened? Crypto became a casino that occasionally produces useful infrastructure. The real winners weren't the true believers—they were the ones who understood that speculation drives adoption, and adoption eventually creates utility.

AI is following the same pattern. The breathless predictions about AGI and human replacement miss the immediate reality: AI is a massive unbundling machine, and it's coming for every knowledge worker who thinks their job is safe.

## The Unbundling Thesis

Every major technology wave follows the same arc: bundle, scale, then unbundle. The internet bundled information access, then search engines unbundled it. Social media bundled human connection, then algorithms unbundled it into infinite feeds. Now AI is unbundling human intelligence itself.

But here's what the AI evangelists miss: unbundling is inherently destructive. When Uber unbundled transportation, it didn't just create ride-sharing—it destroyed taxi medallions worth billions. When Netflix unbundled entertainment, it didn't just create streaming—it killed Blockbuster, movie theaters, and traditional TV scheduling.

AI's unbundling of knowledge work will be far more brutal. Because unlike physical services, intellectual labor has no natural scarcity. Once AI can write, code, analyze, and create at human levels, the economics change overnight. The question isn't whether your job will be affected—it's whether you'll be on the right side of the destruction.

## The Three Waves of Creative Destruction

**Wave 1: The Obvious Targets (Already Happening)**

Content mills, basic customer service, simple coding tasks, routine analysis. These jobs aren't being "enhanced" by AI—they're being eliminated. The companies winning here aren't trying to make humans better; they're trying to make humans unnecessary.

Look at the data: GitHub Copilot writes 30% of code for active users. ChatGPT handles customer service queries that used to require human agents. Midjourney creates marketing visuals that would have taken designers hours. This isn't augmentation—it's replacement.

The mistake most people make is thinking this stops here. It doesn't.

**Wave 2: The Professional Class (Next 2-3 Years)**

Lawyers, consultants, analysts, middle managers, marketers. Anyone whose job involves processing information and producing recommendations is in the crosshairs. AI doesn't need to be perfect—it just needs to be good enough and infinitely scalable.

Consider legal research. A junior associate might spend 40 hours researching case law for a brief. Claude can do the same research in 10 minutes. Sure, it might miss nuances a human would catch. But for 90% of legal research, "good enough" is actually good enough. And that 90% represents millions of billable hours.

The professional class thinks their judgment and experience create a moat. They're wrong. Most professional judgment follows patterns, and patterns are what AI excels at recognizing and replicating.

**Wave 3: The Creative Elite (3-5 Years)**

This is where it gets interesting. The final wave won't target routine work—it'll target the work we thought was uniquely human. Strategic thinking, creative direction, complex problem-solving, leadership.

We're already seeing glimpses. AI can write marketing strategies that outperform human-created ones. It can generate creative concepts that test better with audiences. It can analyze complex business problems and propose solutions that human consultants miss.

The creative elite's advantage isn't creativity—it's context, relationships, and taste. But AI is rapidly acquiring context through training, and taste is often just pattern recognition at scale.

## Why This Matters Now: The Compression Timeline

Previous technology waves took decades to fully unfold. The internet took 20 years to reshape commerce. Mobile took 15 years to change how we live. AI is compressing this timeline to 5-7 years.

The reason is computational scaling. Unlike previous technologies that required physical infrastructure, AI improvement is primarily a function of compute and data—both of which scale exponentially. GPT-4 to GPT-5 represents more capability improvement than we saw in the entire first decade of the internet.

This compression means traditional adaptation strategies don't work. You can't gradually retrain your workforce or slowly adjust your business model. The change is too fast and too fundamental.

## The Real Winners (It's Not Who You Think)

**Not the AI Companies**

Despite the hype, most AI companies will fail. Building AI is expensive, competitive advantages are temporary, and the market will commoditize quickly. OpenAI's moat isn't technical—it's brand and distribution. But brands fade, and distribution can be disrupted.

The real money in AI isn't in building the models—it's in applying them to specific, high-value problems. Just like the internet gold rush, the picks and shovels sellers (cloud providers, chip makers) will outperform most of the prospectors.

**Not the "AI-Enhanced" Professionals**

The narrative that AI will "augment" human workers is largely wishful thinking. In most cases, AI doesn't make humans 10x more productive—it makes humans unnecessary. The lawyers using AI research tools aren't becoming super-lawyers; they're competing with AI that can do their job directly.

**The Actual Winners: Three Categories**

1. **The Orchestrators**: People who understand how to combine AI capabilities to solve complex problems. Not AI engineers, but AI conductors who can design systems that leverage multiple AI tools effectively.

2. **The Relationship Owners**: Those who control access to customers, capital, or critical resources. AI can generate the strategy, but it can't close the deal or make the final decision. Yet.

3. **The Physical World Players**: AI is still largely trapped in the digital realm. Businesses that require physical presence, manual dexterity, or real-world interaction have natural protection—for now.

## The Crypto Parallel: Speculation Drives Adoption

The AI boom mirrors crypto's 2021 cycle perfectly. Massive speculation, inflated valuations, and wild promises about changing everything. But just like crypto, the speculation is serving a purpose—it's funding the infrastructure that will eventually create real utility.

The billions flowing into AI startups aren't just creating hype—they're funding the compute, talent, and research that will make AI genuinely transformative. Most of these companies will fail, but their failure will leave behind better models, cheaper inference, and proven use cases.

This is exactly what happened with crypto. The 2017 ICO bubble funded Ethereum development. The 2021 DeFi summer funded infrastructure that now powers real financial applications. The AI bubble is funding the tools that will reshape how work gets done.

## Actionable Insights: How to Position Yourself

**If You're an Employee:**

Stop trying to become "AI-enhanced." Start building skills that are orthogonal to AI capabilities. Focus on:
- Physical world expertise
- Relationship building and trust creation
- Taste and judgment in ambiguous situations
- System design and orchestration

**If You're a Business Owner:**

Don't ask "How can AI help my business?" Ask "How can AI replace my business?" Then figure out how to do it to yourself before someone else does.

The companies that survive won't be the ones that use AI as a tool—they'll be the ones that rebuild their entire business model around AI capabilities.

**If You're an Investor:**

The AI trade isn't in AI companies—it's in the second-order effects. Real estate in cities that become AI hubs. Traditional companies that successfully integrate AI. Businesses that serve the new AI-powered economy.

## The Real Question: What Happens to Humans?

This brings us back to the crypto parallel. Crypto promised to democratize finance, but it mostly created new forms of speculation and inequality. AI promises to democratize intelligence, but it's more likely to create new forms of cognitive inequality.

The people who learn to orchestrate AI will become incredibly powerful. Everyone else will compete with machines that get better every month while they stay the same.

But here's the thing: this might be exactly what we need. Most knowledge work is soul-crushing busy work that doesn't create real value. If AI can eliminate the drudgery, maybe humans can focus on what we're actually good at—building relationships, creating meaning, and solving problems that require genuine creativity and judgment.

The Great Unbundling isn't just destroying jobs—it's destroying the illusion that most jobs were necessary in the first place. The question isn't whether AI will change everything. It's whether we'll be smart enough to build something better from the pieces.

The destruction is coming whether we're ready or not. The only choice is whether we'll be the ones wielding the hammer, or standing in its path.
