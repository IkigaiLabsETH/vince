Running DRAFT_TWEETS to create a punchy standalone tweet about AI agents.

<DRAFT_TWEETS>
topic: ai agents
format: single
requirements: Under 280 characters, stands alone, sharp take, no engagement bait
</DRAFT_TWEETS>

**Draft Tweet:**

AI agents aren't replacing humans—they're replacing the parts of work that made humans miserable.

The real disruption isn't job loss. It's finally getting to do the work that actually matters.

**Character count:** 199/280

**Why this works:** Takes a contrarian position against the doom narrative, reframes AI as liberation rather than replacement, and ends with aspiration rather than fear. Sharp but optimistic.
