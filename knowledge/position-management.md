# Position Management Mastery

*The art of managing trades after entry*

## The 3 Phases of a Trade

## Managing Winners

### The Letting Run

> "Let winners run."

**Rules:**
- Move stop to breakeven after +1R
- Trail with price
- Don't take profit too early
- **The biggest gains come from a few big winners**

---

## Managing Losers

### The Quick Cut

> "Cut losers short."

**Rules:**
- Never exceed 2% risk
- Stop is stop
- No averaging down
- **Small losses = stay in game**

---

## The Breakeven Move

### After +1R

**Move stop to breakeven** (+ spread)

**Why?**
- Risk-free trade
- Emotion removed
- Let it run

---

## Position Sizing Adjustments

### Based on Confidence

| Confidence | Position Size |
|------------|---------------|
| High | Full |
| Medium | 75% |
| Low | 50% |
| Uncertain | Don't enter |

---

### Based on Volatility

| Volatility | Adjustment |
|------------|------------|
| High | Reduce size |
| Low | Increase size |

```
Size = Risk / (Volatility × Factor)
```

---

## Time-Based Management

### The Calendar Check

| Time Frame | Action |
|------------|--------|
| Daily | Review thesis |
| Weekly | Check fundamentals |
| Monthly | Rebalance |
| Earnings | Exit or hedge |

---

### Expiry Considerations

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Options expiry | Manage assignment risk |
| Earnings | Exit or hedge |
| Fed meeting | Reduce size |
| Quarter end | Rebalance |

---

## Adding to Losers (NEVER)

### Why Averaging Down Fails

1. **Good money after bad**
2. **Increases risk**
3. **Worse odds of winning**
4. **Emotional trading**

**Only exception:** If thesis strengthens AND you have dry powder.

---

## The Partial Exit

### Why Partial?

- Lock in profit
- Reduce risk
- Let rest run
- Remove emotion

**Example:**
- Sell 50% at target
- Move stop to breakeven
- Let rest ride

---

## Rebalancing

### When to Rebalance

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| >25% drift | Rebalance |
| Quarterly | Review allocation |
| Life changes | Reassess |
| Market regime change | Adjust |

---

## The Exit Strategy

### When to Sell

| Reason | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Target hit | Take partial/full |
| Stop hit | Exit |
| Thesis broken | Exit |
| Better opportunity | Rotate |
| Time expiry | Take profit/loss |
| Overextended | Scale out |
