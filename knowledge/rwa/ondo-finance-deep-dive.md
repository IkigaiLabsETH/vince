## Ondo Finance: Product Deep Dive

**OUSG (Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries)** — $717M AUM

- Tokenized exposure to short-term Treasuries, primarily through BlackRock BUIDL
- U.S. Qualified Purchasers only | $100K minimum | 3.28% yield
- Available on Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum
- Instant minting/redemption via BUIDL integration—a key competitive advantage
- Fee: 0.15% management, no entry/exit fees

**USDY (U.S. Dollar Yield Token)** — $1.29B AUM

- Yield-bearing stablecoin alternative backed by short-term Treasuries and bank deposits
- Non-U.S. investors (Reg S) | $1 minimum | 3.49% yield
- Available on 12 chains—widest distribution of any tokenized Treasury product
- Two variants: rebasing (rUSDY, maintains $1 peg) and accumulating (USDY, price appreciates)
- 22,980 holders—largest holder count among institutional-grade tokenized Treasury products
- Competes directly with traditional stablecoins by offering yield pass-through

**Tokenized Equities (Announced)**

- Plans to tokenize U.S. equity exposure (e.g., S&P 500, individual stocks) for global investors
- Would extend the Reg S framework used by USDY to equity products
- Execution depends on regulatory clarity and brokerage partnerships

**Ondo Chain**

- Planned L1 blockchain purpose-built for tokenized securities
- Designed to combine institutional compliance (KYC at the chain level) with DeFi composability
- Would give Ondo control over the full issuance-to-settlement stack
- Risk: building an L1 is expensive, and multi-chain deployment already works well

**Market Position:**

- Combined AUM (OUSG + USDY): ~$2B — second only to BlackRock BUIDL as a single issuer
- Key advantage: only major issuer offering both institutional (OUSG) and retail-accessible (USDY) products
- Key risk: heavy dependence on BUIDL as underlying for OUSG creates single-counterparty exposure
- ONDO token: governance token, not directly tied to product revenue; value accrual mechanism unclear

**Competitive landscape:** BlackRock (BUIDL) dominates institutional, Franklin Templeton (BENJI) leads U.S. retail registered funds, Hashnote (USYC) competes on yield. Ondo's edge is breadth of accessibility and chain coverage.
