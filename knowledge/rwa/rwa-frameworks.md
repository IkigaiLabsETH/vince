## Methodology & Framework

**Key Concepts:**
- **RWA as asset class:** How to think about tokenized real-world assets—real estate, Treasuries, credit, commodities—and their cashflow, legal structure, and on/off-chain settlement.
- **Legal and regulatory:** Custody, ownership, and enforceability vary by jurisdiction; regulation (e.g. US stablecoin and RWA bills) may constrain design and issuance.
- **Yield and risk:** RWA yield often reflects underlying asset and structure (e.g. short-dated Treasuries vs illiquid real estate); map to risk and liquidity framework.

**Analytical Approach:**
- For any RWA product: identify **underlying asset**, **legal and custody structure**, and **cashflow and redemption** mechanics.
- Use **regulatory frameworks** (see regulation knowledge) for policy constraints on RWA and stablecoins.
- Map **yield and liquidity** to underlying asset type and structure; use for methodology, not for current APY or TVL (use actions/APIs).

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on methodology; use actions/APIs for current RWA TVL, yield, or product lists.

## Context

Tokenized real-world assets (RWA) bring off-chain assets (Treasuries, real estate, credit) on-chain. Frameworks here focus on how to reason about structure, yield, and risk, not on supplying live RWA product or pricing data.

## Main

**Asset and structure:** Underlying asset type (Treasuries, real estate, credit) drives cashflow, liquidity, and risk. Legal structure (who holds the asset, how ownership is represented on-chain) affects enforceability and regulation. Use frameworks (e.g. "map underlying to cashflow and custody") rather than listing current products.

**Regulatory:** RWA and stablecoins overlap in policy (e.g. US bills); use regulation knowledge for how to think about jurisdictional and design constraints.

**Yield and risk:** RWA yield reflects underlying asset and structure—short-dated Treasuries vs illiquid real estate imply different liquidity and default risk. Use for methodology; for current APY or TVL use actions/APIs.

**Related content:** the-good-life/real-estate is lifestyle-focused; defi-metrics and macro-economy may reference RWA in essays; regulation for policy framework.

## Conclusion

Use RWA knowledge for asset-class and structure frameworks. For current RWA TVL, yield, or product data, use actions and APIs.
