## Methodology & Framework

**Core Concepts:**
- **Tokenized Treasuries** are on-chain representations of short-duration U.S. government debt, offering near-risk-free yield to crypto-native capital.
- **Product differentiation** comes from legal structure (Reg D, Reg S, registered fund), minimum investment, chain availability, and fee structure—not the underlying asset.
- **Yield pass-through** mechanics matter: rebasing tokens vs. accumulating NAV vs. dividend distribution change composability and tax treatment.

**Analytical Approach:**
- Compare products on: **AUM, yield (net of fees), minimum investment, investor eligibility, chain coverage, redemption speed, fee structure**.
- Legal wrapper determines accessibility: Reg D = U.S. qualified purchasers only; Reg S = non-U.S.; registered funds = U.S. retail.
- Evaluate **DeFi composability**—can the token be used as collateral in lending, DEXs, or as a stablecoin backing?

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Largest products serve institutional capital (BUIDL: $5M minimum, Reg D). Retail access growing via registered funds (BENJI: $20 min, WTGXX: $1 min).
- Multi-chain deployment correlates with AUM growth—products on more chains capture more demand.
- Fee compression is occurring: most charge 0.15-0.30% management fees with zero entry/exit fees.

**Decision Framework:**
- For institutional allocation: prioritize AUM (liquidity depth), redemption mechanics, and custodian quality.
- For DeFi integration: prioritize chain coverage, token standard, and whether the token is permissionlessly transferable.
