## State of RWA Tokenization (February 2026)

The tokenized RWA market has crossed **$15B+ in on-chain value** (excluding stablecoins), up from ~$5B in early 2024. Growth has been driven primarily by tokenized U.S. Treasuries, which represent the largest single category at over **$10B AUM** across 30+ products.

**Key asset classes by size:**

- **Tokenized Treasuries / money markets:** ~$10B+ — dominated by BlackRock BUIDL ($2.18B), Hashnote USYC ($1.62B), Ondo USDY ($1.29B), Franklin Templeton BENJI ($897M), Superstate USTB ($778M), WisdomTree WTGXX ($731M), Ondo OUSG ($717M)
- **Private credit:** ~$3-4B — Centrifuge, Maple, Goldfinch, Credix
- **Real estate:** ~$500M-1B — fragmented across platforms
- **Commodities (tokenized gold, etc.):** ~$1B+

**Key chains:** Ethereum remains dominant for institutional products (BUIDL, OUSG). Stellar hosts Franklin Templeton's BENJI. Solana, Mantle, Arbitrum, and Aptos see growing RWA deployments. Multi-chain is now standard—BUIDL is on 9 chains, USDY on 12.

**Institutional adoption milestones:**

- BlackRock's BUIDL became the largest tokenized fund, crossing $2B in early 2025
- ChinaAMC (CUMIU) brought $544M from Hong Kong institutional capital
- Major banks (JPMorgan, CACEIS, State Street) now serve as custodians or administrators for on-chain funds
- SEC-registered mutual funds (WisdomTree, Fidelity FDIT) are issuing on-chain shares

**What this means:** RWA tokenization has moved from experiment to institutional infrastructure. The question is no longer "will it happen" but "how fast does it scale beyond Treasuries into credit, equities, and alternatives."
