```
   |
   |       /
   |      /
   |     /
   |____/

### The 10-Year Note

**The most important rate in the world.**

- **Low = Growth slowing, deflation**
- **High = Growth strong, inflation**
- **Rising = Risk-on**
- **Falling = Risk-off**

---

## Quantitative Easing (QE)

### What It Is

Fed buys assets (Treasuries, MBS) → adds liquidity → lowers rates → stimulates economy

### Effects

| Asset | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Stocks | ✅ Up |
| Bonds | ✅ Up |
| Gold | ✅ Up |
| Dollar | ❌ Down |
| Volatility | ❌ Down |

---

## Quantitative Tightening (QT)

### What It Is

Fed sells assets or lets them mature → removes liquidity → raises rates → slows economy

### Effects

Opposite of QE

---

## Inflation

### Types

| Type | Cause | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Demand-Pull | Too much money | 2021 consumer spending |
| Cost-Push | Supply constraints | 2022 oil |
| Built-In | Expectations | Wage spiral |
| Currency | Dollar weakness | Import prices |

---

### The Phillips Curve (Theory)

```
Unemployment ↓ → Wage ↑ → Inflation ↑
```

**Reality:** Broken (1970s showed otherwise)

---

### Inflation Hedges

| Asset | Inflation Hedge |
|-------|----------------|
| Gold | ✅ |
| Commodities | ✅ |
| TIPS | ✅ |
| Real Estate | ✅ |
| Stocks | Mixed (quality wins) |
| Bitcoin | Debatable |

---

## Money Supply (M2)

### The Money Multiplier

```
Base Money → Money Multiplier → M2
```

**Fed controls base; banks create the rest.**

---

### M2 vs Markets

- **M2 growing + stocks up** = liquidity supportive
- **M2 shrinking + stocks up** = risk
- **M2 shrinking + stocks down** = liquidity crisis

---

## The Dollar (DXY)

### Why It Matters

- **Reserve currency**
- **Commodities priced in dollars**
- **Global debt in dollars**

### Dollar Strengthens When

- Fed tightens
- Risk-off
- Growth elsewhere slows

### Dollar Weakens When

- Fed eases
- Risk-on
- US growth outpaces

---

## GDP

```
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
     |   |  |   |
     |   |  |   Net Exports
     |   |  Government
     |   Investment
     Consumption
```

### Growth Rates

| Rate | Market Impact |
|------|---------------|
| >3% | Bullish |
| 2-3% | Neutral |
| <2% | Bearish |
| <0% | Recession |

## The Only Truth About Macro

> "The Fed puts."
