- **$PEPE**: Launched as joke → $12B mcap
- **$SUI**: $0.38 → $4.84
- **$SPX**: 0 → $1.5B ecosystem
- **$KAS**: $0.002 → $0.20

**Key Insight**: Altseason happened through narrative cycles, not broad market rotation.

## Investment Strategies & Rotation Playbook

### Capital-Efficiency Framework

| Sleeve | % of Stack | Target | Rationale |
|--------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Core (BTC) | 60-70% | Hold | Low-risk base, market beta |
| Large-Cap (ETH) | 15-20% | ETH/BTC outperformance | Main liquidity from BTC |
| Mid-Cap (SOL) | 10-15% | Established L1s | Proven high-beta winners |
| Degen (memes, AI) | 3-5% | Narrative plays | High-risk, high-reward |

### Execution Triggers

#### Trigger 2: BTC Dominance Breakdown
- **Signal**: Bitcoin Dominance loses 50% level
- **Action**: Mid-caps should outperform

#### Profit Taking Strategy

## Market Warnings & Risk Management

### Crypto Twitter (CT) Risks

- **Risk Management**: Position sizing critical
- **Information Edge**: Seek unique data sources

## Conclusion

The crypto market is transitioning from cyclical retail-driven patterns to institutional-driven secular growth. While Bitcoin remains the primary beneficiary of institutional flows, select altcoins with strong fundamentals and clear use cases present significant opportunities. The key is focusing on quality projects with real-world adoption rather than speculative narrative plays.

**Investment Approach**: Maintain BTC core position while selectively rotating into high-conviction altcoins with strong PMF. Monitor key technical levels and regulatory developments for optimal entry and exit points.

**Risk Management**: This market is "ruthlessly extractive" - maintain strict position sizing and avoid speculation without informational edge.
