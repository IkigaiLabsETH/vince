# Satoshi Private Knowledge

Financial, crypto, and trading knowledge files separated from the Kelly lifestyle concierge agent's RAG context.

These files were moved from `knowledge/kelly-btc/` on 2026-02-17 to reduce RAG bloat — Kelly is a lifestyle concierge and doesn't need crypto trading analysis, Bitcoin mining details, or memecoin research polluting her context window.

## Contents

- **assets/** — Crypto assets, equities, trading strategies
- **bitcoin/** — Bitcoin ecosystem, mining, treasury companies, whitepaper
- **business/** — Fiscal policy, pension analysis
- **media/** — NFT art and digital collectibles analysis
- **technology/** — Lightning Network, AI infrastructure, Web3 legal
- **satoshis-app-pages/** — Satoshi's app Bitcoin cycle pages

## Usage

These files are available for other agents (e.g., a dedicated crypto/finance agent) but are excluded from Kelly's knowledge base.
