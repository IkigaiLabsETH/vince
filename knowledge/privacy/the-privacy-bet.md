Let me tell you about the most underrated comeback story in crypto.

Remember Zcash? That privacy coin that everyone wrote off after the 2021 bull run? The one that seemed destined to become a footnote in crypto history, mentioned only in hushed tones alongside darknet markets and regulatory crackdowns?

## Context

Well, something extraordinary happened while everyone was obsessing over Bitcoin ETFs and meme coin pumps. Zcash didn’t just survive, it transformed. And today, as I write this on a quiet Thursday morning in November 2025, ZEC is trading at $683, up a staggering 1,175% this year alone.

But this isn’t just another pump-and-dump story. This is something deeper. This is about the moment when the world finally woke up to what privacy really means in the age of AI surveillance.

**The Quiet Revolution in Your Wallet**

## Main

Let me paint you a picture. When I was writing about privacy coins being the “Swiss bank account in your pocket” that Obama once feared, most people rolled their eyes. “Who needs that level of privacy?” they’d ask. “I have nothing to hide.”

But then something shifted. Slowly at first, then all at once.

Zcash’s shielded pool, the encrypted vault where transactions disappear into mathematical oblivion, started growing. Not by a little. By November 2025, it had climbed to 23% of total supply, up from just 18% in October. That might not sound like much to the casual observer, but in crypto years, that’s a seismic shift. Think about it: nearly a quarter of all ZEC now lives in perfect cryptographic darkness.

And here’s the kicker: this wasn’t driven by criminals or drug dealers. It was driven by ordinary people—teachers, doctors, small business owners—who finally understood that in a world where AI can track your every financial move, privacy isn’t a luxury. It’s survival.

**The Regulatory Dam Breaks**

For years, privacy coins operated in a legal gray zone. Exchanges delisted them. Regulators whispered threats. Many of us wondered if Zcash would survive the regulatory onslaught.

Then came 2025. The U.S. passed the Clarity Act and Genius Act—a one-two punch that finally created a clear framework for privacy coins to operate legally. This wasn’t some half-baked compromise. This was real regulatory clarity that acknowledged what many of us in the trenches had been saying all along: privacy and compliance aren’t mutually exclusive.

The market reacted like a coiled spring finally released. Zcash surged 472% as institutional money flooded in, recognizing that the regulatory overhang had lifted.

**The Smart Money Moves In**

But here’s where it gets really interesting. The price action wasn’t just retail FOMO. The smart money showed up—and showed up big.

Grayscale, the institutional giant that brought Bitcoin to Wall Street, launched their Zcash Trust. And they weren’t playing around. In one move alone, they accumulated $46 million worth of shielded ZEC. By mid-2025, that trust had crossed $137 million in assets—a level of institutional validation that even the most bullish Zcash advocates hadn’t predicted.

Why would a conservative institution like Grayscale bet big on a “privacy coin”? Because they saw what others missed: Zcash had evolved from a niche privacy tool into something far more important—a critical piece of financial infrastructure for the surveillance age.

**The Real Story Behind the Numbers**

Let me be honest with you: I didn’t see this coming. Not at this speed. Not at this scale.

When I first started writing about Zcash just 2 months ago, I framed it as insurance—a small hedge against a future where financial privacy might become scarce. I suggested putting 1% of your crypto portfolio into shielded ZEC. “If Zcash fails, losing 1% won’t change your life,” I wrote. “If Zcash succeeds, that 1% could be worth more than your entire crypto holdings.”

Turns out, I was too conservative.

What’s happening with Zcash isn’t just about price. It’s about narrative. In the second half of 2025, while the rest of crypto grinds through the same old ETF flows and meme cycles, privacy coins have become the market’s pace-setters. Why? Because the narrative has shifted from “privacy for criminals” to “privacy for everyone.”

Think about this: with global surveillance proposals and AI data harvesting becoming mainstream concerns, users are actively seeking anonymity to avoid blockchain tracking. This isn’t some dystopian prediction—it’s happening right now. The world has finally realized that perfect financial transparency isn’t freedom—it’s a panopticon.

**Why This Time Is Different**

I know what you’re thinking. “Haven’t we been here before? Didn’t privacy coins pump in 2017 and 2021 only to crash harder?”

Yes. And that’s exactly why this time feels different.

First, the fundamentals have changed. Zcash’s shielded pool now contains over 5 million ZEC—a record high that tightens supply and boosts the price outlook. The network has matured from a experimental protocol into a functioning encrypted-money system at planetary scale.

Second, the regulatory environment has transformed. Instead of fighting against privacy, regulators are finally recognizing that tools like Zcash’s “view keys”—which allow selective transparency for compliance while preserving general privacy—are the future of financial regulation.

Third, and most importantly, the world has changed. AI isn’t just coming—it’s here. And it’s hungry for your data. When your phone can predict your financial moves before you make them, when governments can freeze assets based on algorithmic suspicion, when your spending habits can be weaponized against you... well, suddenly that “Swiss bank account in your pocket” doesn’t seem so scary anymore.

My Personal Bet

So where do I stand today? Simple: I may increase my ZEC position.

Not because I think it’s going to moon to $10,000 tomorrow. But because the risk-reward has never been more asymmetric. At $683, ZEC is still trading at a fraction of its 2021 high when adjusted for inflation and network improvements. The inflation rate just halved to around 4.2%—comparable to gold. The next halving in 2028 will bring it down to about 2%.

Think about that. Digital gold with built-in privacy features, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and a growing shielded pool that’s becoming increasingly scarce. If this were a startup, VCs would be fighting to get in.

**The Bottom Line**

Let me leave you with this thought: Zcash isn’t just a cryptocurrency. It’s a statement. A bet on a future where your financial life isn’t an open book for governments, corporations, and algorithms to read and manipulate.

When Snowden participated in Zcash’s first trusted setup ceremony under the pseudonym “John Dobbertin,” he wasn’t just making a technical contribution. He was making a statement about what privacy means in the digital age. Today, as AI-powered surveillance becomes the norm rather than the exception, that statement matters more than ever.

So yes—I’m putting my money where my mouth is. I’m buying ZEC. Not all of it. Not recklessly. But enough to matter. Because in a world racing toward total financial transparency, sometimes the most radical act is to disappear.

And if I’m right about where this world is heading? Well, let’s just say that $683 might look like a steal in hindsight.
