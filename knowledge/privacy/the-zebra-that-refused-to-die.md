Listen, I’m going to level with you. I’ve been in this circus since 2016, back when Zcash launched like some cypherpunk fever dream and promptly 50x’d in a weekend because “privacy coin” sounded sexy and Edward Snowden tweeted nice things. Then it spent the next eight years getting absolutely curb-stomped: delistings, regulatory side-eye, Monero stealing the dark-web crown, the whole tragic opera. Most of us wrote it off as the smart kid who peaked in high school.

And then 2025 happened.

## Context

As I write this on November 20, Bitcoin is bleeding out somewhere south of $90k after a brutal month-long correction that wiped a trillion off the total market cap. The top 100 is a sea of red. Solana’s down. ETH’s down. Even the meme dogs are limping. And yet here’s Zcash, the coin everyone forgot existed, sitting pretty around $650–$700 after a 15x–20x moonshot from its summer lows. Yeah, it’s pulled back from the $740-ish peak a couple weeks ago. Yeah, it’s volatile as hell. But in a market where everything else is getting rekt, ZEC is basically the only grown-up in the top 100 refusing to fully roll over.

So what gives? Is this just the final KOL-fueled pump-and-dump before it goes back to $30 forever? Or did something actually, legitimately change?

Let’s pour a drink and unpack this like adults.

## Main

First, the ugly truth about right now

Yes, ZEC is correcting. Hard. From ~$740 to the low $600s in a matter of days while BTC was busy face-planting from $126k to sub-$90k. Leverage got flushed, perpetual shorts got liquidated on the way up and now longs are getting wrecked on the way down. Classic crypto. If you bought the absolute top because some guy with laser eyes told you $10k EOY, congrats, you’re feeling pain.

But zoom out for two seconds: in the same breath that 95% of the market is down 20–40% from October highs, ZEC is still up 1,200%+ since Labor Day. That’s not “KOL hype.” That’s something sticking.

The real story isn’t the price candle. It’s what people are quietly doing behind the scenes.

The metric nobody was watching (until it went parabolic)

Remember the shielded pool? That’s the fully-private part of Zcash where transactions are encrypted end-to-end with zk-SNARK magic. For years it languished below 15% of total supply because, let’s be honest, shielding used to be clunky as hell and nobody wanted to pay the extra fee when Monero gave you mandatory privacy for free.

Fast-forward to right now: over 30% of all ZEC — more than 5 million coins, north of $3 billion — is locked in shielded addresses. That’s an all-time high, and it’s still climbing even while price dumps.

People aren’t just buying ZEC and dumping it for profits. They’re buying it, shielding it, and sitting on it. That’s HODL behavior. That’s “I actually want financial privacy in a world going full surveillance” behavior.

And no, this isn’t retail apes panic-shielding because of a tweet. The flows are steady, chunky, and coming from wallets that look suspiciously sophisticated.

Why now? Because the tech finally stopped sucking

For the first time in forever, Zcash is actually pleasant to use.

- 
Zashi wallet: default shielded, beautiful UI, one-tap private sends. Feels like Venmo with superpowers.

- 
NEAR Intents integration: swap BTC → fully shielded ZEC cross-chain in one click, no KYC bridge, no nonsense.

- 
Upcoming Ztarknet L2 (early 2026): private DeFi and smart contracts that don’t leak your entire history like Ethereum does.

- 
Tachyon scaling (2026 mainnet): allegedly 100x+ TPS while staying fully private. If Sean Bowe ships this, we’re talking Visa-level throughput with better privacy than cash.

Add the halving that just happened (issuance cut in half) and suddenly the supply/demand math looks spicy.

The “yeah but regulation” elephant

Everyone’s favorite bear argument: “Privacy coins get delisted and die.”Except… Zcash’s optional privacy is the cheat code. Exchanges hate mandatory anonymity (Monero). They’re fine with optional + view keys for audits (Zcash). That’s why ZEC never got fully booted while XMR vanished from half the civilized world.

And ironically, the worse global surveillance gets — CBDCs, chain-analysis middle fingers, governments treating cash like a felony — the more Zcash looks like the compliant-friendly escape hatch.

Okay smartass, what’s the price gonna do?

Short term (rest of 2025): This correction isn’t over. BTC looks like it wants $78–$85k next if sentiment stays trash. ZEC will probably tag $450–$550 on the way down. That’s healthy. That shakes out the tourists. I’m buying chunks there, not gonna lie.

2026: Halving supply shock fully priced in + Ztarknet devnet live + Tachyon testnets showing real throughput = new highs. $1,200–$2,000 feels conservative if privacy stays the narrative. $3k+ if we get the kind of reflexive mania we saw in October.

2027–2030: This is where it gets fun. If shielded adoption hits 50%+ of supply and private DeFi actually works, we’re looking at a legitimate $5k–$10k asset. Arthur Hayes (yeah, the BitMEX guy) already threw out $10k–$18k longer-term because “it’s the only coin that moons when liquidity dies.” Wild? Sure. Impossible? We just watched it 20x in two months while everyone else bled.

Worst case? Regulation goes full nuclear and optional privacy still gets painted as guilty-by-association. Price stagnates or slowly bleeds. But even then, the on-chain metrics say the true believers aren’t leaving.

The bottom line

I sold most of my ZEC at $600 thinking “this is the top forever.” I was wrong. 

I’m not making that mistake twice. I may buy back some. But I’m also blessed that I understood the narrative as early as ZEC under $100.

Zcash isn’t just “another privacy coin” anymore. It’s the only one that finally grew up: usable wallets, real adoption metrics going vertical, upgrades that actually matter, and a narrative (financial sovereignty in a dystopian surveillance world) that feels less tinfoil and more Tuesday every single day.

The zebra was supposed to be extinct. Turns out it was just sleeping.

If the shielded pool keeps climbing while everything else burns, pay attention. That’s not hype. That’s history rhyming.

## Conclusion

See you on the other side.
