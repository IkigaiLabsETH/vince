Ah, crypto Twitter—where convictions flip faster than a Solana outage. Remember five years ago, when the gospel was transparency as a feature? ENS .eth domains weren’t just usernames; they were your digital business card, screaming “Look at me! Link my NFT profile, flex my on-chain history, build my brand!” Vitalik and the ENS crew were out here evangelizing decentralized identity like it was the second coming of the blockchain. Solana’s .sol names? Same vibe—Mert and the Helius squad hyping programmable, readable wallets as the future of Web3. It was all about visibility: “Show your bags, prove your alpha, let the world see your diamond hands.” Over 2 million .eth registrations by mid-2025, billions in NFT profile pics, and endless threads about “on-chain reputation” as the killer app. Privacy? That was for paranoid boomers and darkweb edgelords. We were building the transparent utopia, baby!

Fast-forward to late 2025, and bam—Zcash (ZEC) explodes 20x from its lows around $30, hitting a 7-year high of $744 before settling at ~$578 with a $9.43B market cap. Shielded pool? Up to a record 5.03M ZEC (over 30% of circulating supply hidden in Orchard privacy vaults), with holders shielding like it’s Y2K and the feds are at the door. Suddenly, the same influencers who spent half a decade shilling transparent chains as “the vibe” are rebranding as cypherpunk purists. Arthur Hayes calls a $10K ZEC target and loads up via Maelstrom. Naval drops cryptic “Satoshi’s true vision” tweets. Mert? Defending ZEC’s zk-SNARKs edge over Solana L2 experiments like he didn’t just pump .sol names last month. Even Andrew Tate’s in the mix, whispering about “untraceable alpha.” Ran Neuner frames it as a “collective influence power move,” like early BTC but for privacy. And don’t get me started on Leap Therapeutics rebranding to Cypherpunk Technologies—ditching biotech for a $50M ZEC treasury buy, backed by the Winklevoss Twins, sending their stock (now $CYPH) up 400%.

## Context

Public companies going full cypherpunk? In 2025? That’s not evolution; that’s a narrative rug-pull. Look, I get it. Privacy’s having a moment. EU’s Chat Control is scanning encrypted DMs, IRS subpoenas hit exchanges weekly, and Google’s “crypto privacy” searches spiked 300% this year amid AI surveillance fears.

ZEC’s Nov 18 halving slashed rewards 50%, creating that sweet BTC-like scarcity just as OKX relists it after a 2024 delisting. Shielded transactions are up 60% in a month, proving real adoption—not just pump-fueled theater. ZEC’s opt-in zk-proofs give it regulatory plausible deniability that Monero lacks, making it the “compliant privacy coin” for institutions dipping toes without full banhammer risk. Gemini’s Cypherpunk arm just scooped 1.25% of supply ($59M worth), and even Ryan Sean Adams is like, “Love the return to cypherpunk values—ETH/BTC/ZEC is money.”

Fair play; if surveillance is the new normal, hiding your bags isn’t hopium—it’s hygiene. But here’s the rant-worthy part: Where were these cypherpunks a decade ago? During the 2017-2021 transparency orgy, when Tornado Cash got sanctioned for “mixing” and privacy coins were delisted en masse, these same voices were silent or straight-up mocking “anon bros.” ZEC languished at $20-50 while they grinded for ENS airdrops and Solana speedrun yields. Now? A quick 6.9x pump later (Galaxy Digital’s words, not mine), and everyone’s got amnesia. X is flooded with “ZEC is the future—sold all SOL, privacy > velocity!” threads, as if they didn’t just flex transparent wallets last week. 

## Main

Crypto’s not broken—it’s just human. Narratives are the fuel; when DeFi/NFTs cooled, privacy fills the void. ZEC deserves the shine: It’s fungible, unblacklistable, and a lifeline for dissidents in Venezuela or Russia. But if your “cypherpunk awakening” started with a 6.9x chart spike, congrats—you’re late to the party, and the DJ’s already packing up.

Pro tip for the flip-floppers: Next time, read the whitepaper before the pump. And for the rest of us? Stack what aligns with your threat model, not the Twitter meta. Privacy isn’t a trend—it’s the default setting Satoshi coded in. Time to log off the hype and back on the chain.

**You Pay Your Taxes – Now Stop Advertising Your Net Worth**

We’re one of the good guys: every wallet declared, every tax paid, zero funny business. But we still don’t want strangers, scammers, or Twitter psychos knowing exactly how much we have. That’s not hiding from the IRS – that’s basic safety. Here’s the dead-simple, fully legal way to shut the curtains in 2025:

Let every .eth/.sol vanity name expire; send all your ZEC straight to a fully shielded z-address in the Orchard pool using the Zashi app — the public chain goes blind, Chainalysis sees nothing, yet you still own everything and declare the total value exactly as before. When you need fiat or have to file, simply unshield the required amount to a transparent address and report it normally. Give your accountant the viewing key if they ever want proof — they see every detail, the rest of the world sees zero. Four clicks, ten seconds per transfer, fully legal, fully private. Done.

## Conclusion

**Waltio + Shielded Zcash**

Waltio can’t auto-track fully shielded Zcash because it’s truly private — no public data exists for it to scrape. No problem for honest filers like you: just note the amount and fiat value in a spreadsheet before you shield (that’s your cost basis), then use the viewing key in Zashi to export your shielded history as a CSV and drop it into Waltio manually. When you eventually unshield or sell, Waltio sees that normal transparent transaction and calculates the gain exactly as always. Bottom line: zero extra work at tax time, 100 % compliant, the tax man stays happy, and the rest of the world still sees nothing. Privacy on, billboard off — you’ve paid your dues, now enjoy the peace you’ve earned.
