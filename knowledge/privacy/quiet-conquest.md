A friend sent me a detailed breakdown of Amazon’s AI moves last week. Solid analysis: Trainium chips getting cheaper and faster, Nova models punching above their weight on price-performance, frontier agents automating the boring parts of enterprise workflows, and a million robots humming away in warehouses. The conclusion? Amazon is undervalued because it’s building “boring but valuable” AI that compounds into real margins, not just demo videos.

He’s right on the facts. AWS re:Invent 2025 delivered exactly that script—Trainium 3 UltraServers now live, Nova 2 family expanding with multimodal and speech capabilities, Nova Forge letting enterprises train private frontier models, and those autonomous agents (Kiro for code, security and DevOps variants) that can run for days without human babysitting.

## Context

But here’s where I pause.

Great Execution, Questionable Moat in a Commodity World
\*\*
Amazon isn’t chasing the spotlight with consumer-facing miracles. It’s doing what it does best: scaling infrastructure, squeezing costs, and locking in enterprises with seamless integration. Trainium 3 on 3nm silicon? Impressive—up to 4.4x performance and 4x efficiency over the last gen, with claims of 30-50% savings versus Nvidia equivalents for big workloads. Early wins with Anthropic prove it’s not vaporware.

AI Factories extend the playbook: ship managed racks (Trainium or Nvidia) straight into customer data centers for sovereignty and low latency. Classic lock-in—once you’re in the AWS ecosystem, switching costs skyrocket.

> And robotics? Hitting 1 million deployed units earlier this year, powered by foundation models like DeepFleet that shave 10% off fleet routing times. That’s a decade of proprietary physical-world data no one else has. Real moat.

## Main

The stock reflects none of this hype. Mid-December 2025, AMZN sits around a $2.4 trillion market cap, up only low single digits YTD while AI darlings rotate in and out of favor. Heavy capex ($120B+ trailing) gets digested quietly because the core (e-commerce, ads, AWS) keeps compounding.

If operational AI delivers even half the promised savings—billions in fulfillment efficiencies, faster AWS revenue growth—it rerates higher in 2026. Analysts already whisper 20-30% upside if chip adoption scales.

Fair enough. Amazon survives because it builds things that work at planet scale, without needing narrative oxygen.

Now flip to crypto.

Visa or Ethereum? Stripe or Solana?

We keep telling ourselves crypto infrastructure is the next internet stack. L1s as the rails, tokens capturing value from blockspace commoditization turned into eternal fees.

But look closer.

Who really captures the value when technology normalizes?

In payments: Visa and Stripe win. Not the open protocols.

In cloud: AWS wins. Not the bare-metal providers.

In AI: Who benefits most from cheaper compute and better models?

Enterprises plugging them into workflows.

Not the open-source trainers or token-gated datasets.

Amazon’s thesis works because it’s vertically integrated. It builds the chips, trains the models, deploys the agents, and reaps the margins internally while selling the surplus to others.

Crypto infrastructure? Fragmented. L1s compete on speed and cost, but value accrues upstream—to apps, stablecoin issuers, enterprises building private chains, or legacy firms layering on top.

Solana screams fast blockspace. Ethereum layers scale. But the FDVs? Eye-watering relative to revenue.

> Bitcoin at sub $90k, total market ~$3T in late 2025—impressive exponent, sure. But altcoin seasons come and go, and infrastructure tokens keep leaking value to the application layer.

The Boring Truth About Value Capture\*\*

I believe in the exponent. I believe in technology.

Crypto will become invisible plumbing: stablecoins settling trillions, tokenized assets normalizing, DeFi unit economics finally beating TradFi on margins.

But who gets paid?

Not the base layer holders, mostly.

Circle and Tether print dollars. BlackRock and Fidelity wrap Bitcoin. Enterprises run private validators or hybrid setups.

Amazon captures because it owns the stack end-to-end.

Crypto’s open nature commoditizes the bottom. That’s the feature—and the bug.

Patience is the edge here.

Skepticism keeps you alive long enough to collect when the real adoption hits.

Where I’m Positioned

Mostly Bitcoin and cash. Small bets on things with actual PMF in payments and RWAs. No leverage. No moonshot infrastructure bags at 100x revenue multiples. Amazon might indeed rerate on its unsexy AI grind. Good for them.

## Conclusion

In crypto, the unsexy winners are the ones that survive the resets.

Good luck out there.
