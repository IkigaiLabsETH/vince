Crypto’s first principle in 2025 is simple: three trillion dollars of value is being carried by somewhere between forty and seventy million monthly active users. That is the entire punchline and the entire problem in one breath.

Forty to seventy million people are, right now, moving three trillion dollars around with the same fervor that eight hundred million once moved cat photos and status updates on Facebook, or that eight hundred million now ask ChatGPT to write their emails.

## Context

The per-user valuation embedded in that ratio is absurd by the standards of almost any other industry. At the midpoint of 50 million active users, the market is pricing every engaged person at roughly 60.0000 dollars. Facebook went public at roughly 180 dollars per user. OpenAI’s last round implied 625 dollars per user. Crypto is asking the world to believe each active participant is worth more than most Americans’ net worth, and the world, astonishingly, keeps saying yes.

This is where the conversation usually splits into two camps.

The first camp issues a sober reminder: we are nowhere close to the scale required for a ten-trillion-dollar asset class, let alone the “flippening” dreams of twenty or fifty trillion. A billion active users feels like the minimum viable civilization size for that kind of money.

## Main

The second camp immediately counters that the comparison is misleading because crypto is not a social network or a consumer chatbot. It is a financial layer, and financial layers have always commanded dramatically higher revenue and valuation per user than attention layers.

Both camps are right, and that is why the tension is so productive.

Start with the financial-layer argument, because it is the cleaner kill shot against the raw-user-count anxiety. JPMorgan Chase has roughly 60 million digitally active customers and an 850-billion-dollar market cap. That is 14.000 dollars per user. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and the large European banks cluster in the same 5.000-to-15.000-dollar range. Visa and Mastercard serve something closer to 3 billion cards, but their market caps still only price the average cardholder at 200 dollars or less. PayPal, the closest spiritual cousin in the fintech world, sits at roughly 428 million active accounts and an 80-billion-dollar valuation, or less than 200 dollars per user.

Crypto, even with the most conservative active-user estimates, is already trading at a multiple of three to five times the largest traditional financial institutions on a per-user basis. If you take Binance’s hundred million registered users and narrow it to the fifty million who actually trade with intensity, the implied value per engaged person moves into five figures. Coinbase, with its ten million monthly transacting users (out of a hundred and five million verified), is closer to five thousand dollars per transactor. These are not social-media economics. These are hedge-fund economics applied to a consumer base.

> The reason is straightforward: the median crypto user is not posting memes or paying for coffee. The median crypto user is allocating capital, earning yield, hedging currency risk, or speculating on leverage. One on-chain DeFi user who borrows a 100.000 dollars against ETH collateral and pays eight percent interest generates more annual revenue for the ecosystem than a thousand Venmo users sending birthday money back and forth. Activity quality compounds faster than headcount.

This is why stablecoins are the silent revolution almost no one prices correctly. More than 600 billion dollars of tokenized dollars now sit on blockchains, and they turned over 27 trillion dollars in volume last year alone. That is already larger than the payment volumes of Visa and Mastercard combined, achieved with a fraction of one percent of their user base. \*\*

The revenue per user is orders of magnitude higher because every transfer is a treasury operation, not a latte purchase.

> Yet none of this negates the core insight of the sober camp: three trillion is a defiant valuation, but ten trillion is a different civilization. Ten trillion requires institutions, pension funds, sovereigns, and, crucially, hundreds of millions of retail users who treat crypto as boringly normal. The per-user premium can compress as the user base scales; it almost certainly will. What it cannot do is disappear entirely unless the asset class itself becomes materially less interesting.

The path from seventy million to a billion is therefore not primarily about finding a billion new speculators. It is about turning the existing 700 million owners (the dormant holders who bought some Bitcoin in 2021 and never touched it again) into monthly active participants, and then adding another 300 million who never felt the need to own crypto in the first place.

That activation layer is already in motion. Telegram’s 900 million users are one wallet click away from TON. Robinhood’s 14 million retail traders are one toggle away from self-custody. PayPal’s 400 million accounts can already buy bitcoin in the app. Revolut’s 45 million European users trade crypto alongside their stock portfolios. The Mastercard and Visa networks, with their three billion cards, have begun routing stablecoin spend in pilot markets. The pipes are being laid; the question is how quickly the water flows through them.

The most underrated variable is mobile-first emerging markets. India has a hundred million crypto owners but still single-digit millions of monthly active traders because user experience remains clunky and capital controls bite. Nigeria, Argentina, and Turkey combined have another hundred and twenty million owners who use crypto as a dollar escape hatch, yet most still do it through centralized exchanges with painful KYC. Solve for gasless, mobile-native, KYC-optional-but-compliant onboarding, and the activation curve goes vertical. Solana’s meme-coin casino in 2024 and 2025 proved that when the user experience is finally good enough, tens of millions of people will show up in weeks, not years.

The final piece is real-world cash flows. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries, corporate bonds, and private credit funds crossed thirty billion dollars on-chain in 2025. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund alone grew to fifteen billion. When a retiree in São Paulo can earn five percent on dollar yields without opening a U.S. brokerage account, the user count stops being a marketing problem and starts being an integration problem.

## Conclusion

So here is the synthesis: crypto’s current three-trillion-dollar valuation is not a bubble of delusion; it is a bet that the per-user revenue premium can be maintained even as the user base grows tenfold. The market is pricing each active user like a hedge-fund client because, for now, many of them effectively are. The trillion-dollar question is whether the industry can broaden that cohort to a billion without diluting the intensity that justifies the multiple.

History says it can. Every transformative financial innovation (joint-stock companies, fractional reserve banking, credit cards, ETFs) started with tiny, hyper-intense user bases commanding absurd per-user economics, then scaled into something vast and boring while retaining a meaningful premium over the legacy system. Crypto is still in the first act of that play.

> Seventy million people have already voted with their capital that this is the future of money. The next 930 million do not need to share their fervor; they only need to find it convenient. When convenience arrives (and it is arriving faster than most people realize), the market cap will stop looking defiant and start looking inevitable.
