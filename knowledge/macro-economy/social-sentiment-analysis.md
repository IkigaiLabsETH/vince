# Social Sentiment Analysis for Crypto Markets

## Core Concepts

### Sentiment Categories

#### Bullish Signals

- **Accumulation Talk**: "Buying the dip", "DCA'ing", "Loading up"
- **Target Discussion**: Specific price targets, "Next stop $X"
- **Comparison**: Historical cycle comparisons showing upside
- **FOMO Indicators**: "Don't miss out", urgency language

#### Bearish Signals

- **Distribution Talk**: "Taking profits", "Sold some", "Trimming"
- **Risk Concerns**: Macro fears, regulatory worries, leverage warnings
- **Comparison**: Bear market parallels, crash predictions
- **Capitulation**: "I'm out", "Cutting losses", emotional language

#### Neutral/Contrarian

- **Caution**: "Wait for confirmation", "Not chasing"
- **Balanced View**: Acknowledging both bull and bear cases
- **Divergence**: Going against prevailing sentiment

### Sentiment Quantification

#### Confidence Levels

- **High Confidence (70%+)**: Clear consensus, strong conviction language
- **Medium Confidence (50-70%)**: Mixed signals, hedged statements
- **Low Confidence (<50%)**: Uncertainty, questioning, indecision

#### Sample Size Considerations

- **Minimum**: 20-30 posts for meaningful signal
- **Ideal**: 50-100+ posts for statistical relevance
- **Quality**: Engagement-weighted (likes/retweets matter)

## Key Signal Sources

### Twitter/X Crypto Community

#### Tier 1 Accounts (Highest Signal)

- Consistent track record of calls
- Large following with high engagement
- Often contrarian at extremes
- Examples: Institutional traders, successful fund managers

#### Tier 2 Accounts (Good Signal)

- Solid analysis, moderate following
- Focus on specific niches (DeFi, options, etc.)
- Technical + fundamental perspective
- Examples: Protocol researchers, analytics providers

#### Tier 3 Accounts (Context)

- High engagement, may lack depth
- Reflect retail sentiment accurately
- Good for FOMO/FUD detection
- Examples: Influencers, community leaders

### Platform-Specific Signals

#### Reddit (r/cryptocurrency, r/bitcoin, r/wallstreetbets)

- Retail sentiment pulse
- Meme and narrative tracking
- FOMO/FUD amplification
- Long-form discussion for nuance

#### Discord/Telegram

- Real-time alpha channels
- Project-specific sentiment
- Insider community vibes
- Earlier signals than Twitter

#### YouTube/TikTok

- Mass retail indicators
- Extreme sentiment (late-cycle)
- Narrative virality tracking
- Often lagging indicator

## Analysis Frameworks

### Sentiment Cycle Mapping

#### Early Bull (Disbelief)

- **Dominant Sentiment**: Skepticism, "dead cat bounce"
- **Signal Value**: High (contrarian opportunity)
- **Key Voices**: Permabulls quiet, bears confident

#### Mid Bull (Belief)

- **Dominant Sentiment**: Cautious optimism
- **Signal Value**: Medium (trend confirmation)
- **Key Voices**: Analysts building cases

#### Late Bull (Euphoria)

- **Dominant Sentiment**: "This time is different"
- **Signal Value**: High (contrarian warning)
- **Key Voices**: Everyone bullish, retail flood

#### Early Bear (Denial)

- **Dominant Sentiment**: "Just a correction"
- **Signal Value**: High (confirmation of top)
- **Key Voices**: Bulls defending, dismissing concerns

#### Mid Bear (Capitulation)

- **Dominant Sentiment**: "Crypto is dead", despair
- **Signal Value**: High (contrarian opportunity)
- **Key Voices**: Rage quit posts, "told you so"

#### Late Bear (Acceptance)

- **Dominant Sentiment**: Apathy, low engagement
- **Signal Value**: Medium (accumulation zone)
- **Key Voices**: Only believers remain

### Contrarian Framework

#### Extreme Bullish = Caution

- Social volume spikes
- "To the moon" dominates discourse
- Retail flooding in
- Influencers shilling aggressively
- **Action**: Consider taking profits, reduce leverage

#### Extreme Bearish = Opportunity

- Capitulation threads
- "Crypto is dead" narratives
- Long-term holders questioning
- Silence from bulls
- **Action**: Consider accumulation, prepare for reversal

### Divergence Detection

#### Price vs Sentiment

- **Bullish Divergence**: Price falling, sentiment improving
- **Bearish Divergence**: Price rising, sentiment cooling
- Often precedes reversals

#### Volume vs Sentiment

- **Healthy**: High sentiment + high volume
- **Warning**: High sentiment + low volume (no conviction)
- **Capitulation**: Low sentiment + high volume (forced selling)

## Practical Application

### Daily Monitoring Routine

1. **Morning Scan** (15 min)
   - Check overnight sentiment shift
   - Identify any viral threads
   - Note divergences from price action

2. **Key Account Review** (10 min)
   - Tier 1 accounts' latest takes
   - Any position changes announced
   - Contrarian voices active?

3. **Narrative Tracking** (5 min)
   - What's trending?
   - New narratives emerging?
   - Old narratives fading?

### Pre-Trade Sentiment Check

#### Before Bullish Entry

- [ ] Sentiment not at euphoric extreme
- [ ] Smart money accounts supportive or neutral
- [ ] No obvious contrarian warnings
- [ ] Retail not fully positioned

#### Before Bearish Entry

- [ ] Sentiment not at capitulation extreme
- [ ] Smart money not calling bottom
- [ ] No obvious contrarian accumulation signals
- [ ] Leverage not already flushed

### Reporting Format

## Common Pitfalls

### Echo Chamber Effect

- Following similar accounts = biased view
- Solution: Deliberately include contrarian sources

### Recency Bias

- Recent posts weighted too heavily
- Solution: Compare to 7d/30d sentiment baseline

### Engagement Traps

- High engagement ≠ correct analysis
- Solution: Weight by track record, not popularity

### Bot/Shill Noise

- Coordinated campaigns distort signals
- Solution: Focus on organic accounts, check account age

### Timing Mismatch

- Social leads/lags price at different cycle stages
- Solution: Map sentiment to cycle position
