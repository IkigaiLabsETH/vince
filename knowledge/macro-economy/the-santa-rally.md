We are standing in the middle of one of the most powerful confluences of monetary, institutional, and psychological tailwinds in the history of risk assets, and most of the world is still looking the wrong way.

Tomorrow the Federal Reserve will cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points. That much is already priced. What is not priced is everything that happens next.

## Context

The man who is now the prohibitive favorite to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, Kevin Hassett, spent the weekend telling anyone who would listen that the central bank has “plenty of room” to move faster and deeper than markets expect. When asked directly if he would support a 50-basis-point cut as soon as the data allowed it, Hassett did not hedge. He smiled and said yes. Donald Trump, who will nominate the next chair, has already gone further: the new leadership will “lower rates immediately.” Powell’s term expires in May 2026. The shadow chairmanship of Kevin Hassett begins the moment markets believe the baton is being passed, and that moment was last week.

Cheap money is coming back, and it is coming back angry.

Meanwhile, the crypto market has spent the past month quietly cleansing itself of the exact kind of frothy leverage that killed the 2021–2022 cycle. 133 million dollars in short positions were liquidated in a single hour last week. Total liquidations across the board topped half a billion. Perpetual funding rates are now negative on every major pair. In plain English: almost no one is leveraged long, and the people who were leveraged short have been carried out on stretchers. The market has shaken out the tourists and left a base of hardened skepticism—the perfect soil for a year-end melt-up.

## Main

Spencer Hallarn, Cumberland’s global head of over-the-counter trading, put it bluntly: “We’ve shaken out a lot of the bulls and built a solid base of skepticism. That setup looks pretty bullish for a Santa rally. I think EOY is looking good.” Translation: the pain trade is violently higher.

This is not 2021 hopium. This is 2025 reality.

Bernstein, the $700 billion asset manager that almost never sticks its neck out on crypto, just raised its Bitcoin forecast to $150,000 by the end of next year and $1 million by 2033. Their reasoning is simple and brutal: the four-year halving cycle is dead. In its place is an elongated institutional supercycle driven by spot ETFs that now hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi himself and by a Treasury department that is openly courting the asset as a strategic reserve.

> Changpeng Zhao, speaking at Bitcoin MENA yesterday, said the same thing in fewer words: “The four-year cycle is over. We are in a supercycle.”

Michael Saylor dropped an even bigger bomb last week in Dubai. Eight of the ten largest U.S. banks have called him in the past twelve months asking for advice on how to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Not retail brokerage accounts. Balance sheets. The same banks that were mocking him in 2020 are now racing to avoid being the last major financial institution without a Bitcoin strategy.

Today PNC Bank, the $410 billion regional giant turned national player, became the first top-tier American bank to offer its private banking clients direct Bitcoin trading and custody through a native integration with Coinbase. No third-party app, no separate login, no disclaimers about “high risk.” Just Bitcoin, sitting in the same portal as the bond ladder and the muni fund.

The dam did not crack. It vaporized.

And then there is Jack Mallers, the 30-year-old founder of Strike, who rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange this morning for the listing of Twenty One Capital—ticker XXI—a company whose sole purpose is to hold Bitcoin and grow Bitcoin per share. It debuted with 43,500 BTC on the balance sheet, roughly four billion dollars at today’s price, making it the third-largest public holder behind only MicroStrategy and Marathon. The message from the floor of the NYSE was unmistakable: Bitcoin is no longer an asset class. It is a corporate treasury strategy listed on the most prestigious exchange in the world.

> All of this is happening against the backdrop of the most dovish Federal Reserve pivot since the pandemic, a deleveraged crypto market, and a new administration that has promised to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.” The liquidity spigot is opening. The institutions are piling in. The skeptics have been rinsed.

## Conclusion

This is not a question of if we get a Santa rally. It is a question of how violent it will be. The same people who told you $69,000 was the top in 2021 are now telling you $100,000 is the top in 2025. They are going to be wrong again, for the same reason they were wrong the last three times: they continue to underestimate the speed at which large pools of capital move once consensus flips. The consensus has flipped. The shorts are gone. The leverage is gone. The policy is turning. The banks are here. The corporations are here. The next Fed Chair is already auditioning for the job by promising easier money than anyone thought possible six months ago.

> Everything that needed to happen for the mother of all year-end rallies has already happened. The only thing left is the price.

Buckle up. The ride up is going to be generational, and it has already begun.
