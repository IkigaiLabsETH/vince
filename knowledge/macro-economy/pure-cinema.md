It was the 1st week of August 2024 when the financial world remembered an old truth: markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, but when the music finally stops, the ones dancing with the most borrowed money fall hardest.

On July 31, the Federal Reserve delivered its first rate cut in four years. Markets cheered. Risk assets ripped higher. Bitcoin touched $68,000, the Nasdaq flirted with all-time highs, and the narrative machine spun tales of a soft landing and endless liquidity.

## Context

Then, without warning, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates by a modest 25 basis points and signaled more were coming. The yen, which had been the world’s favorite punching bag for a decade, suddenly woke up.

Within ten days the Nikkei entered a bear market, the VIX recorded its third-highest print in history, and Bitcoin plunged from $68,000 to $49,000 in a move so violent that $1.3 billion in leveraged long positions were wiped out in less than seventy-two hours.

The culprit was not some mysterious black-swan event. It was the oldest play in the global macro handbook: the yen carry trade, unwinding with mechanical brutality.

## Main

Fast-forward to December 2025\*\*. The setup is not merely similar. It is nearly identical, only larger, more leveraged, and occurring at higher absolute prices. The Fed meets on December 10 and is widely expected to cut rates again.

The Bank of Japan meets nine days later and is openly debating another hike. The yen carry trade, which never truly went away after August, has been quietly rebuilt over the autumn. Bitcoin is trading under $90K, perpetual funding rates are positive again, and the same traders who were liquidated last summer have convinced themselves “this time is different.” It isn’t.

The carry trade is one of the most powerful recurring forces in modern finance precisely because it is so simple. Borrow in a currency where interest rates are near zero (for 30 years that currency has almost always been the Japanese yen), convert the proceeds into a higher-yielding currency or asset, and pocket the difference.

When the trade is small, it is a harmless arbitrage. When it scales to trillions, it becomes a self-reinforcing monster that distorts every risk market on earth until the moment the funding currency decides it has been abused long enough.

**August 2024 was that moment. December 2025 could be the sequel.**
\*\*
What makes this iteration particularly dangerous for cryptocurrency investors is that Bitcoin and the broader digital asset complex have graduated from fringe speculation to fully paid-up members of the global risk basket. In 2017, when the last big yen-driven volatility tantrum hit markets, Bitcoin barely noticed. In 2024, it led the selloff.

Open interest on perpetual futures, stablecoin margin balances, and the explosive growth of tokenized leverage have turned crypto into the most sensitive barometer of deleveraging pressure on the planet.

> When hedge funds and Japanese margin traders need to raise yen quickly, they do not sell their blue-chip stocks at 3 p.m. Tokyo time. They close the positions that trade twenty-four hours a day and settle instantly. That means Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and everything else with a liquid futures market.

The math is unforgiving. A 10 percent move higher in the yen against the dollar has historically been enough to erase an entire year’s worth of carry profit and trigger margin calls on positions levered even two or three times.

In July and August of 2024 the yen rose roughly 12 percent in three weeks. The crypto market lost half a trillion dollars in market cap almost overnight. The low was printed exactly one week after the initial shock, and the recovery began the moment the forced selling exhausted itself.

> If the Fed cuts on December 10 and the Bank of Japan follows through with another hike on December 19, the timeline compresses perfectly into the least liquid two weeks of the year. Tax-loss harvesting, holiday-thinned trading desks, and year-end bonus locking will all amplify the move. A 20 to 30 percent drawdown from current levels would be the base case, not the tail risk. That would take Bitcoin toward the $70,000 to $75,000 zone faster than most holders believe is possible, and it would take the average altcoin back to prices many thought we would never see again.

Yet here is the part that separates speculation from investing: these moments of mechanically induced panic are almost always the best buying opportunities of an entire cycle. August 5, 2024, when Bitcoin briefly traded below $49,000, is already up more than 100 percent only four months later. The traders who understood that the selloff was not a referendum on Bitcoin’s long-term viability but a liquidity event driven by a thirty-year-old currency arbitrage were the ones who bought the low and never looked back.

We are not predicting the future with certainty. Central banks have surprised markets before, and they will again. The Bank of Japan could blink. The Fed could sound unexpectedly hawkish. But probabilities are not symmetrical here. The market is positioned for a continuation of the autumn melt-up. Funding rates, CFTC commitment of traders data, and the re-emergence of aggressive basis trades all point to complacency. The path of least resistance for a violent reset is straight ahead.

Bitcoin was born in the aftermath of the greatest carry-trade unwind in history: the 2008 global financial crisis. It has survived every subsequent deleveraging episode, not because it is immune to them, but because each one flushes out the weakest hands and the most irresponsible capital. The survivors inherit a market with tighter spreads, higher conviction, and a cleaner ledger.

> If the next few weeks play out the way history suggests they might, sometime between December 15 and Christmas 2025, Bitcoin will again capitulate hard and fast. The screams on social media will be deafening. The obituaries will be written once more. And for those who have studied the rhythm of these events, who understand that carry-trade blowups are not the end of risk appetite but merely its periodic purge, it will be the clearest signal of the cycle that the best time to buy is when the forced sellers are finally done.

The yen carry trade is not Bitcoin’s enemy. It is the grim reaper that keeps clearing the forest floor so the strongest trees can grow taller. When the dust settles in January, the market will look expensive again, the funding rates will flip negative, and the same voices declaring the end will be wondering how they missed the bottom one more time.

## Conclusion

TL;DR of the rebound analysis\*\*

> History is crystal clear: whenever Bitcoin has suffered a sharp mid-to-late December capitulation (2018, 2022, 2024, etc.), the following January has delivered an average +15% rebound, often much more (+29%, +37%, +22% in those cases). With the Fed in easing mode and a potential yen-carry flush pushing us to a mid-December low around $70k–$80k, the 2019 playbook (Fed pivot → +169% yearly explosion) is in play again, only this time with $120B+ in ETFs, post-halving supply shock, and trillions more global liquidity. Result: a $70k–$80k December bottom followed by +15% in January and another strong leg in February puts $110k–$130k firmly on the table by February 2026. Not hopium, just the math of every prior post-capitulation, post-pivot cycle. If the carry trade gifts us one more violent washout before Christmas, treat it as the setup for the easiest trade of 2026.

We have seen this movie before. We know exactly how it ends.
