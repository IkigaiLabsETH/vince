Look, everyone’s been hyped about the CLARITY Act finally bringing some sane rules to U.S. crypto. The idea was simple: sort out whether tokens like SOL are securities or commodities, draw clearer lines between the SEC and CFTC, and give stablecoins and DeFi some breathing room. For Solana specifically, passage looked like a big win—potentially confirming SOL as a commodity, clearing the legal cloud from those old SEC lawsuits against exchanges, and opening the door to real institutional money through ETFs.

But right now, the odds of this thing sailing through in January are looking thin. The Senate Banking Committee has a markup scheduled for January 15, but the Agriculture Committee just pushed theirs back to the 27th because they’re drowning in 137 amendments and can’t get bipartisan agreement.

Worse, heavy hitters like Coinbase have straight-up pulled their support, calling the current draft “materially worse than the status quo.” They hate clauses that could ban tokenized real-world assets, slap money-transmitter rules on DeFi devs, shift more power to the SEC, and kill yield on stablecoins—basically handing banks a win at crypto’s expense.

A lot of people in the industry are now saying “no bill is better than a bad bill”.

So yeah, delay feels more likely than passage this month, maybe stretching into February or longer. Short-term, that’s probably bad for SOL price.

Crypto runs on narrative, and January has already been riding the “regulatory clarity coming soon” wave—SOL’s up around 10% year-to-date while Bitcoin flirted with $97K. If the markups flop or get bogged down, we’ll probably see a classic “sell the news” reaction. Some analysts are calling for a 15-30% pullback on altcoins, especially ones like SOL that would benefit most from being officially labeled non-securities. We’ve seen this movie before—remember the FIT21 delays in 2024? Alts bled 20-40% when momentum stalled.

SOL futures are heavily leveraged right now; a 10% drop could wipe out $183 million in longs and make the move even uglier. Traders on X are already bracing for a dip, with plenty calling the recent pump a “liquidity hunt.”

That said, it probably won’t be a total apocalypse. The Trump admin is openly pro-crypto—David Sacks is in there pushing for this stuff—and ongoing Bitcoin ETF inflows could put a floor under the market.

Solana’s actual network is still crushing it: DeFi TVL over $10 billion, memecoin mania still going strong, and real tech upgrades rolling out. A delay might just mean a manageable 10-20% correction rather than a rout.

Longer term, missing the January window isn’t fatal, but it keeps Solana (and the whole sector) in regulatory purgatory. That limbo is a mixed bag: it forces projects to build anyway, rely on self-regulation, or lean on friendlier states, but it also scares off big money that wants clear rules.

SOL is especially exposed because so much of its value comes from DeFi—if a future bill ends up with harsh developer liability or anti-DeFi rules, that could genuinely hurt the ecosystem. On the flip side, delay could actually be good if it forces lawmakers to fix the worst parts.

There’s pressure from the new administration, plus companion bills like Lummis-Gillibrand that could get folded in. If we eventually get a clean bill that treats SOL like a commodity and green-lights ETFs, the upside could be massive—some folks think 50-100% gains or more as institutions finally pile in.

There are really three plausible paths from here:

Most likely (maybe 60% chance): It’s just a temporary delay. The bill gets tweaked in Q1, Coinbase and others come back on board, and it passes in revised form. Short-term dip, then quick recovery and eventual breakout higher once commodity status is locked in.

Medium chance (around 30%): Total stalemate. Partisan fighting kills momentum and nothing passes in 2026. Short-term pain turns into prolonged altcoin bleeding, SOL grows organically through DeFi but misses the institutional wave. Price stays range-bound or drifts lower.

Low chance (10% or less): A bad version somehow squeaks through—super restrictive on DeFi and stablecoins. Initial relief rally on “clarity,” followed by reality setting in and a serious hit to Solana’s ecosystem. Could shave 20-50% off the valuation long-term.

No passage in January means more short-term volatility and probably a healthy correction for SOL. It’ll sting, especially if tomorrow’s markup goes sideways. But crypto has survived way worse regulatory limbo—Solana itself got hammered after FTX but still 10x’d on pure ecosystem growth. As long as the network keeps shipping and macro liquidity stays friendly, the long-term story stays intact.

Just don’t get wrecked on leverage waiting for the dip.

UPDATE: Senate Banking Committee has cancelled today’s voting on the crypto market structure bill after the Coinbase CEO withdraws support.

The CLARITY Act has hit a procedural delay, with markup pushed to late January over concerns including potential restrictions on stablecoin yields, DeFi oversight, and SEC-CFTC jurisdiction balance. Negotiations remain active with bipartisan and White House involvement, so passage is still likely in some form—it’s a refinement, not a derailment.

This development ties directly into fresh commentary from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who warned on January 15 that unrestricted interest-bearing stablecoins could trigger up to $6 trillion in deposits migrating from the traditional banking system (roughly 30-35% of US commercial bank deposits). He framed this as a systemic risk that would impair banks’ lending capacity and raise borrowing costs—a classic bank lobby argument against fully permissive yield-bearing stables.

Current CLARITY drafts, influenced by banking groups, explicitly include provisions to prohibit or severely limit direct interest/yield payments on stablecoins solely for holding them (while allowing some activity-based rewards). This is designed to close perceived loopholes and protect the banking sector—meaning passage would likely block the exact explosive migration scenario Moynihan highlighted, rather than enable it.

Impact on our Solana thesis: Limited direct upside from unrestricted yields, but no major invalidation—and potential net positives.

Why it’s not the slam-dunk yield-driven catalyst some hoped for: The $6T potential underscores the massive scale possible if yields were fully unleashed, but CLARITY’s trajectory caps that vector to safeguard banks. Solana wouldn’t see the hypothetical flood of yield-chasing capital directly into issuer-level stablecoins.

Why the core stablecoin growth story remains intact (and resilient): Solana’s $15B+ stablecoin TVL ATH (200% YOY growth) is driven primarily by utility, not direct holder yields—ultra-low fees (<$0.00025/tx), sub-150ms finality (post-Firedancer), and unmatched throughput (60M+ daily tx, zero major downtime in 750+ days). This powers real inflows via DeFi liquidity, payments, RWAs, and trading volumes ($29B weekly DEX highs, outpacing Ethereum). On-chain yield opportunities (lending pools, Jupiter/Ethena integrations, protocol rewards) can likely persist even under issuer-focused restrictions, keeping the flywheel spinning: more stables → deeper liquidity → higher volumes → SOL fee burns → scarcity pressure.

Broader regulatory clarity as a tailwind: Even with yield limits, a passed bill would reduce FUD, provide clearer rules for institutions, and encourage more on-ramps/integration (e.g., Visa, JPMorgan, Ondo, Western Union USDPT). The delay itself is mildly positive short-term—it preserves the status quo where organic growth continues unchecked, avoiding premature restrictions.

Risk/reward context: This doesn’t derail our vibe shift narrative. Ecosystem momentum (pump.fun ATHs, token deployments, retail rotation), technical delivery (Firedancer, upcoming Mobile V3/Ranger), institutional flows (SOL ETFs >$1B AUM, consistent inflows, corporate treasuries staking), and SOL/BTC ratio extremes remain the primary drivers. Stablecoin projections ($1T global by mid-2026, Solana capturing outsized share) hold via utility dominance, not needing unrestricted yields.

In short, we’re monitoring final bill language—if negotiations soften yield restrictions, that becomes an upside surprise. But our 2026 targets ($250-320 avg, 2x from ~$140 entry) don’t hinge on it. The accumulation zone thesis strengthens: Solana’s fundamentals compound independently while regulatory noise sorts itself out. Position holds—risk-reward still tilted favorably.

Solana (SOL) is currently trading around $142 USD (as of January 15, 2026), down about 3% in the last 24 hours, after rejecting resistance near $148–$149. This comes after a new all-time high of $294 reached on January 19, 2025—marking a significant pullback in what appears to be a post-peak correction phase.

Fibonacci retracements identify potential support (in downtrends) or resistance (in uptrends) based on key ratios: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% (golden ratio), and 78.6%. Traders most often apply them to Solana on macro swings.

Retracement levels downward from the ATH (potential support zones):

23.6% — ≈ $226 (weak support, already broken)

38.2% — ≈ $185 (moderate support, broken)

50% — ≈ $151 (psychological midpoint, recent test zone)

61.8% — ≈ $117 (strong/confluence support, often holds in healthy corrections)

78.6% — ≈ $69 (deep correction, bull market invalidation risk)

Current price at $142 sits just below the 50% level, with recent analyses highlighting confluence support near $135–$138 and deeper zones around $132–$126 if selling accelerates. A hold above the 61.8% (~$117) would keep the multi-year bull structure intact for eventual retest of highs.

Shorter-Term / Recent Swing Fibs

Focus on the rally to $294 and subsequent pullback, showing:

Near-term resistance: $155 (38.2%), $170 (50%)

Support clusters: $135–$134 (61.8–78.6% of recent sub-swings)

These are probabilistic tools—confluence with volume, structure (higher lows), and macro factors (Bitcoin trend, Solana ecosystem metrics) matters more than any single level. The setup looks corrective so far, but a clean break below $117–$120 would shift risk toward deeper bearish resolution.

The SOL/BTC Ratio – Cycles of Compression and Explosive Rebounds

In re-underwriting our Solana thesis, we initially leaned heavily on fundamentals: blistering network growth, stablecoin dominance, technical delivery, and the shifting regulatory backdrop. Yet the single most overlooked variable—especially for a high-beta asset like SOL—has always been its performance relative to Bitcoin. The SOL/BTC ratio distills market sentiment into its purest form: when it compresses to extremes, it signals capitulation; when it expands, it captures rotation and outperformance.

As of Jan 15, 2026, the ratio sits at approximately 0.001485—near multi-year lows and pressing against a horizontal support zone that has held through multiple cycles (roughly 0.0014–0.0016). This level is not random. It echoes prior reversal points that preceded some of the most violent upward moves in Solana’s history. History does not repeat, but in crypto it often rhymes with remarkable fidelity.

Historical Rebounds: Patterns of Pain and Payoff

The 2021 Breakout Phase
From early trading levels near 0.0003–0.0006, the ratio exploded to a cycle peak above 0.0050. That move delivered 8–15x gains in ratio terms alone, coinciding with Solana’s emergence as a legitimate Ethereum challenger. Low fees, NFT mania, and early DeFi traction pulled capital away from Bitcoin’s dominance peak.

The Post-FTX Capitulation Rebound (2022–2025)
The deepest low came in late 2022, dipping toward 0.0004–0.0006 amid existential fears after FTX’s collapse. From there, the ratio staged a multi-year recovery, reaching interim highs near 0.0032–0.0038 by mid-2025. The full rebound from absolute lows produced 6–8x gains, with intermediate legs often delivering 3–4x as sentiment swung from despair to euphoria.
This period is the closest analog to today: Bitcoin led the initial recovery out of the bear market, pushing dominance above 65% and crushing alts to multi-year ratio lows. Once macro liquidity stabilized and Bitcoin consolidated, capital rotated into higher-throughput narratives—Solana chief among them.

Intra-Cycle Rotations (2023–2024)
Within the broader recovery, smaller but still meaningful rebounds occurred from consolidation floors around 0.0008–0.0012 up to interim peaks of 0.0020–0.0028. These legs typically yielded 2–3.5x and were driven by Solana-specific catalysts: token extensions, early Firedancer tests, mobile wallet traction, and memecoin surges.

Across every instance, sub-0.002 readings—especially below 0.0016—have marked generational entry zones. The ratio has never sustainably broken lower in a bull market regime without quickly reversing higher.

The Current Setup: A Familiar Coiled Spring

Today’s 0.001485 reading represents a roughly 57–60% drawdown from the 2025 cycle peak (~0.0035). This degree of compression is standard for high-beta layers when Bitcoin dominance reasserts itself after an initial bull leg. Yet the underlying fundamentals are markedly stronger than in prior cycles:

Stablecoin supply at all-time highs (> $15 billion, +200% YoY).

DEX volumes consistently outpacing Ethereum.

Zero major outages in over 750 days.

Firedancer live and scaling throughput further.

Institutional footholds deepening (SOL ETFs > $1 billion AUM, corporate staking).

These are precisely the ingredients that have historically fueled altcoin rotation once Bitcoin’s marginal buyer exhausts itself.

Implications for 2026 Outperformance

If the cycle follows precedent—and absent a macro shock—the script is clear. Bitcoin will likely continue leading in the near term, potentially pushing dominance toward 60–65% and compressing alts further (possible brief test of 0.0012–0.0013). Then comes the rotation phase: as Bitcoin consolidates post-ETF maturation and supply dynamics digest, capital seeks higher-beta exposure.

Plausible ratio targets based on historical rebounds:

Conservative mean-reversion: 3x → ~0.0045 (SOL delivering ~2x BTC).

Base case: 5x → ~0.0074 (SOL 3–4x Bitcoin).

Bull case: 8x+ → revisiting 2021 extremes (full altseason euphoria).

Even moderate outperformance would translate to substantial USD gains for SOL, especially alongside Bitcoin grinding higher on macro tailwinds.

Risks remain real—prolonged regulatory stalemate, renewed centralization FUD, or a broader risk-off event could delay or attenuate the move. Yet precedent weighs heavily in favor of buyers at these extremes. The deepest compression (2022) produced the largest subsequent rebound; today’s pain, while acute, is occurring against a far more resilient ecosystem backdrop.

In short, the SOL/BTC ratio at current levels strengthens rather than undermines the accumulation case. It reminds us that Solana’s most explosive periods have always followed periods of maximum pessimism relative to Bitcoin. As regulatory noise resolves (in whatever form) and on-chain momentum continues compounding, the setup for 2026 outperformance looks historically familiar—and asymmetrically favorable.
