## Why crypto fell off a cliff — liquidity, China, and gold

Michael Howell’s core argument: the recent crypto weakness isn’t primarily an adoption or narrative failure but a liquidity story — global liquidity is peaking and Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to that inflection. *Bitcoin is the world's most sensitive asset on the planet*; when liquidity growth slows, risk assets react first and hardest. At the same time gold’s large, short-term surge is being driven by a China-specific liquidity impulse rather than a simultaneous global loss of confidence in bonds; *gold is an alternative trade* rather than a simple “risk-off” asset.

Key supporting points from the conversation: Chinese liquidity has been rising fast (Howell cites roughly $1.1 trillion injected by the People’s Bank of China in the past year), Chinese equities and tech are outperforming (he notes Chinese stocks up strongly, ~25%), and China’s domestic buying and policy are pushing the yuan-denominated gold price higher, which then feeds the dollar gold price. Major bond markets show relatively stable term premia and low volatility overall, so the bond complex isn’t signaling a global sell-off; the Japanese move has been concentrated at the very long end and reflects a relative shift into equities more than a sovereign-credit panic. Howell distinguishes two liquidity conduits: “Treasury QE” (short-term issuance monetized through the banking sector) that feeds the real economy, and central-bank balance-sheet operations that prime financial markets; both matter for asset flows and can move different asset classes in different ways.

Practical outlook and conclusions Howell gives: 2026 may be an “accumulation” year for Bitcoin and similar monetary-inflation hedges rather than a breakout year because he expects global liquidity to be under pressure; nevertheless the long-term trend for assets like gold and Bitcoin is upward because debt burdens will ultimately be monetized. He recommends buying monetary-inflation hedges on weakness (a simple guideline: buy below one standard deviation of trend; he mentions the low 80,000s for Bitcoin as a reasonable entry region if attainable) and watching bond-market volatility and short-term funding metrics (term premia, repo activity, and any widening in sovereign yields) as the key triggers that would force central-bank responses. Overall, Howell frames the episode as a normal cyclic inflection in a multiyear liquidity cycle where commodities and real-economy exposures can outperform even as highly liquidity-sensitive financial assets pause.
