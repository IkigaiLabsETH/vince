I am writing this from a terrace in Bordighera, western Liguria. Ten kilometres to the west lies Menton and the French border; forty-five minutes beyond that, Monaco glitters like a diamond dropped on the sea. The same sun that warms the billionaires’ yachts in Monte Carlo is warming my espresso, but my tax bill is a rounding error compared to what it would be if I had stayed on the other side of that invisible line.

Two years ago that sentence would have sounded delusional. Italy was the country people fled from, not to. Today it is the place an entire class of mobile, crypto-native, high-net-worth Europeans are quietly moving to and almost nobody outside a few private Telegram groups has noticed.

## Context

This is the story of how that happened, why it is accelerating, and why it is almost perfectly timed for anyone holding Bitcoin, and why  if you sit on seven or eight figures and still have a French (or British, or German) tax residency, you are running out of time to act.

**I. The Macro Accident**

Let us start with the accidents of history that lined up like planets.

## Main

France, in a fit of post-COVID fiscal desperation, introduced a 1 % annual tax on unrealised gains for “unproductive wealth” above roughly €2 million — and explicitly included cryptocurrencies in the base.  The first declarations are due in the spring of 2026. A €2.5 million Bitcoin position will therefore generate a €25 000 annual tax simply for existing. That single line in the 2025 Finance Act has already triggered more private-jet movements out of Nice-Côte d’Azur airport than the entire Panama Papers scandal.

Portugal, the previous safe harbour, committed suicide in slow motion. A 55 000-application backlog, a political decision to stretch the citizenship clock from five to ten years, and a new 28 % capital-gains tax on crypto have turned the Golden Visa from “set-and-forget” into “set-and-regret”.

The United Kingdom abolished the non-dom regime entirely for new arrivals and began taxing unrealised foreign gains for long-term residents.**London’s Mayfair agents report that 2025 enquiries from British HNWIs looking at Italy outnumber those for Dubai for the first time since records began.

Italy, the country that spent the 2010s being written off as the sick man of Europe, quietly executed one of the most impressive fiscal and administrative turnarounds on the continent. Public debt stabilised, exports hit €600 billion with a trade surplus, the stock market doubled the European average return since 2020, and the bureaucracy, still heavy, learned how to say yes to wealthy foreigners instead of no.

The result is a vacuum. And nature, as we know, abhors a vacuum.

II. The Menu That Suddenly Appeared**

Italy did not invent new programmes out of thin air; it simply refused to kill the ones that worked and made the bureaucracy around them tolerable.

- 
The impatriati regime (50–60 % income-tax exemption for five to ten years) has already brought back more than 100 000 Italians and is now pulling in remote workers from Berlin to Bucharest.

- 
The 7 % flat tax for pensioners in the South has turned sleepy villages in Puglia and Sicily into the new Dordogne for British and Scandinavian retirees.

- 
The researcher regime (90 % exemption for up to thirteen years) is the best-kept secret in European academia.

- 
The lump-sum regime rose from €100 000 to €200 000 per year, but still offers the lowest effective rate in Europe for anyone earning north of €3–4 million.

- 
And then there is the Investor Visa at €250 000, half the price of Portugal, zero stay requirement, and, crucially, you get the visa first and only then send the money.

That last detail is not trivial. In Portugal you wire half a million into a fund and pray. In Italy you receive the residence permit, enter the country, and only then complete the investment within three months. If something goes wrong, your capital never left home. Risk asymmetry matters when you are moving eight fig.

**III. The Bitcoin Accident**

Here is where things become almost comical. Italian corporate law contains a creature called the startup innovativa, a special vehicle that enjoys enormous regulatory flexibility for six years. One of those flexibilities is the ability to hold “digital assets” on its balance sheet without triggering immediate taxation at the corporate level until distribution. A young company named [Bitizenship Italia](https://palombo.substack.com/) registered itself as exactly such a startup, raised a Bitcoin treasury, wrote the shareholder agreement so that 90 % of realised profits flow to preferential Class B shareholders, and offered those shares as the qualifying €250 000 investment for the Investor Visa.

In plain English: You send €250 000 (payable in Bitcoin or USDC), you receive an Italian residence permit that is renewable indefinitely with zero days of physical presence required, and you retain economic exposure to Bitcoin with a contractual right to withdraw your capital every twenty-four months.

The structure is legal, audited, and already has more than a hundred shareholders, exited Web2 founders, cardiac surgeons from Zurich, Bitcoiners who never thought they would live in Europe again.
**
I know three of them personally. None of them live in Italy full-time.
They spend August in Portofino, December in Courchevel, and the rest of the year wherever the surf or the powder is best. Their tax rate on Bitcoin gains, when they finally take them, will be 26 % (rising to 33 % in 2026, but still capped via the elective 18 % portfolio regime if they choose). No wealth tax. No unrealised-gains tax. No inheritance tax on assets held outside Italy.

IV. The Geography of the New European Wealth Belt**

If you open Google Maps and draw a line from Geneva to Genoa, then down the Ligurian coast through Sanremo, Imperia, Alassio, until you hit Portofino, you have mapped the new silent riviera of European crypto wealth.

- 
40 minutes from Nice airport

- 
90 minutes from Monaco by car or helicopter

- 
30 minutes from the French border, so you can keep your French doctor, your children’s international school in Sophia-Antipolis, your membership at the Yacht Club de Monaco

- 
Villas with sea view at €600 000–€1.2 million instead of €4–12 million on the other side of the border

- 
Same weather, same restaurants, same rosé, one-tenth of the tax

The Italians call the area the Ponente Ligure. 

The French call it “just behind Ventimiglia, why would anyone live there?” 

The new arrivals call it the cheat code.

**V. The French Exit Playbook**

For anyone currently French-resident with a large Bitcoin position, the sequence has become almost become standardised:

- 
Spend the winter 2025–2026 anywhere but France (Dubai, Andorra, or simply the Italian side of the border).

- 
Apply for the Italian Investor Visa in January–February 2026 (processing time 10–14 weeks).

- 
Receive the decree, enter Italy, complete the €250K investment (BTC).

- 
Register residence in a Ligurian comune (Sanremo and Bordighera).

- 
File your final French tax return in May 2026 declaring departure as of 1 January 2026.

- 
Receive the quitus fiscal after the summer confirming non-residency.

- 
Sleep.

There is no French exit tax on unrealised crypto gains. There is no Italian wealth tax. There is no minimum stay requirement in Italy. You have just removed a 1 % annual bleed on your entire stack for the cost of a single apartment in Monaco.

**VI. The Next Twelve Months Are the Window**

Windows close. They always do. Italy is already debating whether to raise the lump-sum regime to €300 000 in the 2026 budget. The Investor Visa minimum could follow Portugal upwards if the day the applications hit critical mass. France is extending its audit look-back period to ten years for “false domiciliation abroad”.

Every month you wait is a month closer to the door narrowing.I have watched this in real time. The first movers bought villas in 2023 for €450 000 that are now worth €750 000. The second wave in 2024 paid €650 000. The people asking me for introductions today are being quoted €950 000–€1.4 million — and they are still buying, because the tax savings pay for the house in four years.

**VII. Postscript from the Terrace**

The church bells of Bordighera just rang seven o’clock. The same bells have rung since the 1600s. Empires have come and gone, tax regimes have risen and fallen, but the sun still sets over the same sea. What has changed is that, for the first time in a century, the intelligent money is flowing toward Italy rather than away from it. If you have seven figures or more in Bitcoin, a European passport, and a desire to keep both your wealth and your sanity, the next move is no longer a question of if. It is a question of how quickly you can get on the train before the station gets crowded. The espresso is finished. The sun is dropping behind Cap d’Antibes. And somewhere across the border, another French tax inspector is opening another file wondering where all the millionaires went.

They came here.**Quietly.
One Bitcoin at a time.

Why, in the End, We Stayed in France**

And yet… we didn’t leave. The villa in Bordighera is still on Idealista, marked “favourited” but never booked for a viewing. The Bitizenship consultation link sits unclicked in my bookmarks. The BTC are still in the same French-notarised cold wallet they have occupied since 2021, and my tax residency certificate for 2026 will still read “xxx”. Here is the truth nobody writes in the migration threads: Italy is the rational move. France is the emotional one. And at a certain altitude of wealth and life stage, emotion quietly wins. We ran the numbers a hundred times. The 1 % unrealised wealth tax on the crypto will cost us next year, annoying, but not existential. The 30 % flat tax (PFU) on realised gains is higher than Italy’s 26 %, yet we have not sold a single satoshi in four years. Borrowing against the stack is tax-free liquidity in France just as it is in Italy.
So the actual delta, once borrowing and deferral and lifestyle inflation are modelled honestly, is irritating, but not life-changing. 

Then come the intangibles that no spreadsheet survives.

We already own the house, paid off. Selling it would trigger a 19 % plus-value tax and a crazy notary bill just to buy something half as nice on the Italian side. The Monaco Yacht Show, the Cannes Film Festival parties, the GP weekend, the Christmas Eve dinner at Louis XV, these are not “lifestyle”. And perhaps the deepest reason, we discovered we actually like being French. The cheese is better. The bureaucracy is infernal, but it is our infernal bureaucracy.

So we will pay the tax next spring, shrug, and watch the sun set over the same bay we have watched for the last decade. The Bitcoin will keep stacking quietly in the background. And when people ask why we didn’t take the “obvious” Italian arbitrage, we give the only honest answer that matters: Because some optimisations are measured in euros saved, and others are measured in aging parents nearby, and the knowledge that the life you spent twenty years building does not have to be dismantled for the sake of a marginal tax rate.

## Conclusion

Italy will still be there, ten kilometres down the road. 

À la vôtre.
We’re staying.
