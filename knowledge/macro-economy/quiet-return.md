I’ve spent the last few weeks scrolling through the same macro-crypto threads on X, over and over. The story is almost scripted: Trillion-dollar deficits force massive T-bill floods—hundreds of billions weekly—equaling unchecked money printing. Central banks ease globally. Risk assets moon. Bitcoin grinds through $80K-$100K resistance, retests its all-time high, then surges to $200K by late ‘26.

And don’t forget the cherry on top: Ethena’s synthetic dollar explodes in demand, sending $ENA parabolic. It’s a compelling tale. Clean lines, heroic arcs. 

## Context

It feels inevitable.

I get the appeal. I share the long-term conviction. 

Bitcoin’s scarcity is real. Its role as the hardest money in a softening fiat world grows clearer every cycle. In ten years, it will trade far higher than today’s $88K.

## Main

But conviction without skepticism is just faith. And faith gets wrecked by reality. This narrative? It’s seductive—but dangerously overstated.

**The Numbers Are Stubborn Things**

Start with the deficits everyone cites as “unsustainable Armageddon.”Fiscal year 2025 (ended September 30) closed at $1.8 trillion. Not the $2 trillion-plus doomsayers kept repeating. Tariffs delivered unexpected revenue. Student loan tweaks and moderated spending growth shaved the edges.

FY2026 projections? CBO and street estimates cluster around $1.7–$1.9 trillion early in the year, with two months showing deficits lower than prior periods due to timing and revenue boosts. 

Huge? Absolutely. Structurally challenging? Without doubt.

But not the accelerating catastrophe some charts suggest.

Then there’s the killer claim: “$500 billion per week” in T-bills to finance it all.

That’s fiction.

Treasury’s official estimates for late 2025:

- 
Q4 2025 net borrowing: ~$569 billion (full quarter)

- 
Q1 2026: ~$578 billion

Rough math: $45–$50 billion weekly net issuance. Gross auctions hit $100–$200 billion often, but rollovers mean net new supply is modest.

No credible data supports sustained half-trillion weekly figures. It’s likely a mix-up of quarterly peaks, gross rolls, or simple hyperbole.

The liquidity injection is real—but it’s a steady drip, not a gushing firehose.

**The Real Liquidity Shift Is Nuanced (And More Bullish Long-Term)**

Here’s where the story gets interesting.

Quantitative tightening ended December 1, 2025. The Fed halted balance sheet runoff after draining trillions since 2022. Reserves stabilized; markets now price in potential reinvestments or “technical” purchases to manage them.

Global dovishness adds fuel: China stimulating, ECB and BOJ accommodative.

Bitcoin’s correlation with global M2 remains strong (~0.94 historically). 

Falling real yields historically propel hard assets forward.

Directionally, the macro tailwind is there. 

A genuine liquidity upcycle could emerge in 2026.

Bitcoin pushing $150K–$200K next year? 

Plausible—if policy stays supportive and no shocks derail it.

But we’ve danced this dance before.

**Valuation Reality in a Hope-Driven Market**

Bitcoin at $88K commands a $1.75 T MC. Larger than Meta. Larger than Nvidia. Companies with trillions in revenue, billions of users, and widening moats.

Bitcoin has scarcity. Narrative. Network effects hardening daily.

It also has hope. Powerful hope.

Hope lifts prices far. 

But hope doesn’t cushion drawdowns when leverage unwinds or sentiment flips. Current levels already discount substantial future adoption and monetary debasement. The exponent works over decades—not guaranteed quarters.

**Where Value Truly Flows (And Where It Leaks)**

This cycle exposed crypto’s persistent ache: infrastructure tokens bleed value while applications capture it. Layer-1s and Layer-2s generate fees—but tokens dilute, fragment, commoditize. The premium accrues upstream, closer to users.

Stablecoins are the quiet winners. 

Yield-bearing, seamless plumbing.

Ethena’s USDe remains a standout. Battle-tested through volatility, integrated deeply in CeFi and DeFi. The synthetic dollar model shines in a yield-hungry world: on-chain dollars that actually earn something, unbound by traditional rails. Supply contracted sharply late 2025—down over 20% in November alone—as users shifted preferences. Now stabilizing around $6–$7 billion, yields normalized to sustainable levels.

Demand could resurge if easier policy drives yield chasing.

But the $ENA token? Down ~80% year-to-date. Governance utility exists. 

Staking rewards flow. Yet accrual feels indirect, diluted.

Echoes of Ethereum in 2018: infrastructure hoped for fee capture; apps and stables reaped most gains. Legacy plugs in. 

Applications dominate. Base layers scrap for margins.

**The Chop Ahead, The Convexity Beyond**

As 2025 closes, Bitcoin consolidates $80K–$100K. Uncertainty lingers: rate paths, tariff effects, political theater. A year-end relief bounce is possible. True momentum likely waits for unambiguous liquidity confirmation—probably mid-2026. Until then, preserving capital trumps chasing narratives.

**My Own Ledger**

Long Bitcoin—deep conviction in the asset, not the ticker tomorrow.

Light allocation to yield-bearing stables, including sUSDe positions for carry. Zero leverage. No all-in moonshots on $200K timelines.

Skepticism has kept drawdowns manageable.

Patience compounds the asymmetry.

I believe in sound money. 

I believe in immutable scarcity.

I just refuse to believe every ripple is the tidal wave.

The exponent is real. It rewards survivors.

Stay solvent out there.

This is not investment advice. 

## Conclusion

Markets punish hubris longer than solvency allows. 

Always do your own research.
