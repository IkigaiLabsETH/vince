We're seeing some very strange things on the markets. To be honest, the more days pass, the more I'm left speechless, and I genuinely think a lot of people are underestimating the scale of what's happening right now.

**The Statistical Impossibilities**

## Context

Last Tuesday, the 30-year Japanese debt recorded a so-called "6-sigma" session. Yesterday, silver went even further, with a 5-sigma move on the way up and 6-sigma on the way down. IN A SINGLE SESSION.

To explain quickly, in finance we measure price variations around an average using the standard deviation, called sigma. A 1-sigma move is commonplace. 2-sigma is common. 3-sigma becomes rare. 4-sigma is exceptional. 5-sigma already corresponds to something that, in theory, should only happen once in a million observations. 6-sigma is supposed to occur once in 500 million.

Among the 6-sigma-type episodes, there's the October 1987 crash with the Dow Jones down -22% in one session, the COVID crash of March 2020 with the S&P 500 at -12% and the VIX at 80, the surge in the Swiss franc in January 2015 after abandoning the EUR/CHF peg, or even WTI oil turning negative in April 2020. Do you get the picture?

## Main

**The Real Cause: Market Structure, Not News**

A 6-sigma event is almost never triggered by a simple macro news item, but it almost always stems from the market's structure through leverage, overly concentrated positions, margin calls, collateral issues, and forced selling or buying. It's important to understand because we're talking about internal tensions in the system's mechanics.

As you know, the Japanese bond market is at the heart of the global financial system, and I'm not going to revisit the topic, but a 6-sigma move on a market this massive doesn't go unnoticed. Seeing a 6-sigma move on silver a few days later gives plenty to think about. Beyond the industry, silver is used as an alternative store of value and as a hedging instrument against monetary depreciation. Also, this market is quite narrow and highly financialized, so when positions become imbalanced, adjustments are violent—seeing such a rare move on silver suggests we're dealing with a major move under pressure.

**Why Cross-Asset Contagion Matters**

Why are we seeing, just a few days apart, extreme statistical events on such different markets?

1. When a pillar of global financing becomes unstable, leverage tends to contract, and two things happen at the same time: forced selling on certain assets and forced buying of protection on others. Historically, precious metals often end up as beneficiaries.

2. Long-term rates say something about the credibility of states—that is, their ability to honor future debts without massively resorting to inflation. Precious metals say something about the credibility of the currency itself, and when both become unstable at the same time, we're facing a questioning of the monetary framework.

**The Paradigm Shift Signal**

Generally, when a regime starts to crack, the adjustments are brutal, and it's exactly in those moments that multiple high-sigma events pop up across different asset classes. I repeat, but seeing two 6-sigma events back-to-back isn't commonplace.

## Conclusion

Gold and silver are telling you explicitly that we're living through a true paradigm shift.

**Key Takeaways:**

- 6-sigma events reveal internal market structure stress, not just news reactions
- Japanese bond instability = global leverage contraction incoming
- Silver's narrow, financialized market amplifies systemic pressures
- Cross-asset sigma clustering = regime change signal
- When rates AND precious metals destabilize together: monetary framework questioned
- This is not normal volatility—this is structural break territory
