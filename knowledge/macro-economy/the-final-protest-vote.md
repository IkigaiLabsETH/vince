Man, it’s November 21, 2025, and if you’re reading this, you’re probably feeling it too—that low-key nausea that comes from watching the world pretend everything’s fine while the wheels are quietly coming off.

Bitcoin just dipped below $93,000 again last night. The headlines are screaming “bear market,” “crypto crash,” “all 2025 gains erased.” ETFs are bleeding, leverage is getting rinsed, and the same people who were calling for $200k two months ago are now doom-posting about sub-$80k. Feels familiar, doesn’t it? Like 2022 all over again.

## Context

But here’s the thing they’ve all forgotten: this dip isn’t a bug. It’s the feature.

**The American Middle Class Is Still Dead**

Remember when boomers bought houses for two years’ salary and thought millennials were just bad at avocado toast? Well, zoomers are now paying $9 for iced coffee while rent eats 60% of take-home and student loans compound like a mafia debt.

## Main

Nothing has changed. Actually, it’s worse.

You still work 60 hours, hand half to taxes, half to debt, and pray your 401k doesn’t get Nvidia’d. Groceries are fake, eggs are luxury items, and the dollar you earn today buys less tomorrow because some guys in a marble building decided 2% inflation is “stable” (except when it’s 8%, then it’s “transitory”).

The crisis isn’t coming. It’s here. And it’s by design.

The system isn’t broken—it’s working exactly how they want it to. Extract your energy, turn it into yacht upgrades for the .01%, and keep you too tired to notice.

**Bitcoin Is Still Your Life Raft**

Every cycle, the same script plays out.

- Price moons

- Normies pile in at the top

- Leverage builds up like Jenga

- Something (tariffs, rate hikes, whatever) pulls a block

- Everything crashes

- Bitcoin “dies” for the 400th time

- The strong hands buy the dip

- Cycle repeats higher

We’re in that “Bitcoin dies” phase right now. And it’s beautiful.

Because every time this happens, Bitcoin comes out stronger. More institutions own it. More companies have it on the balance sheet. More nation-states are eyeing it for reserves. The network is more secure, Lightning is faster, ETFs are deeper, and the halving math is still undefeated.

Strategy (you know, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy) just scooped another 8,000+ BTC during this dip—at $102k average. They’re sitting on almost 650,000 coins now. That’s over 3% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist, held by one company that raised cheap capital and said “fuck it, we’re all-in on the hardest money ever created.”

They’re not selling. They’re buying more while everyone else panics.

That’s the signal.

**Bitcoin Is Not Crypto (Still True in 2025)**

Walk through the casino wing of crypto and it’s the same circus: memecoins pumping 1000x on vibes, DeFi protocols rugged, NFTs forgotten, layer-1s promising to “kill Ethereum” for the 47th time.

Then you step into the Bitcoin room.

Quiet. No marketing team. No roadmap. No VCs. No presale. No influencers shilling their bags.

Just 21 million coins. Fixed supply. Undefeatable security. 16 years of never being hacked at the protocol level.

Everything else is noise.

Bitcoin isn’t trying to be faster payments or Web3 or whatever flavor of the month. It’s digital gold. Neutral, finite, borderless money that can’t be printed when politicians need votes or banks need bailouts.

The rest of “crypto” is just tech stocks with extra steps. Bitcoin is the only one that actually solved money.

**This Is the Final Protest Vote**

You don’t need permission to own Bitcoin. No KYC if you mine it or earn it peer-to-peer. No bank can freeze it. No government can seize it without your keys. No corporation can dilute it.

In a world where everything is fake—news, food, jobs, elections, optimism—Bitcoin is the one thing that’s ruthlessly real.

Every sat you stack is a vote against the cantillon casino. Every wallet you self-custody is civil disobedience. Every time you refuse to sell during a dip, you’re telling the system: “You don’t own me.”

They can print dollars. They can’t print Bitcoin.

They can censor your speech. They can’t censor your transactions if you run your own node.

They can bail out banks. They can’t bail out math.

**The Secret Is Fully Out (And That’s Okay)**

For years we had the best asymmetric bet in history. Now corporations are raising billions specifically to buy Bitcoin. Pension funds are dipping toes. Sovereign funds are watching that Galaxy Digital $9.5B sale get absorbed like it was nothing.

The edge is gone for early adopters. But the upside? It’s just getting started.

There’s not enough Bitcoin at these prices for all the companies that now understand: holding cash is a melting ice cube. Holding bonds is guaranteed loss. Holding Bitcoin is the only treasury asset that has outperformed every other strategy for 15 straight years.

Price will go higher because it has to. Supply is fixed. Demand is compounding.

**Final Thought**

Yeah, it hurts watching red candles. Yeah, your portfolio looks ugly right now. Yeah, your group chats are full of paper hands capitulating.

But zoom out.

We’re 16 years into a monetary revolution. The fourth halving cycle. ETFs with billions in AUM. Companies holding it as primary treasury. Nation-states stacking.

This dip? It’s the last big shakeout before the real adoption wave hits.

You won’t buy Bitcoin “someday.”
You’ll buy it now, during the fear, when it’s on sale.
Or you’ll watch from the sidelines as the thing you knew was inevitable happens without you.

Fiat is dying—slowly, then all at once.
Bitcoin isn’t.

Choose your side.

The rebellion is just getting started.

P.S. If you’re still waiting for “the perfect entry,” congratulations—you just lived through it. Again.

## Conclusion

See you on the other side. ₿
