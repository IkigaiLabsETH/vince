We were promised a future of mass technological unemployment that would force society to invent a new social contract. We were told the only humane response would be Universal Basic Income, a perpetual government stipend so that the jobless could still eat while the robots took over.

That future is not coming. It is being cancelled by physics.
\*\*
As of the last quarter of 2025, the data are no longer ambiguous. Artificial intelligence, combined with the steep learning curves of solar, batteries, robotics, and synthetic biology, is triggering the fastest sustained decline in the cost of goods and services in recorded history. The marginal cost of calories, kilowatt-hours, housing materials, transportation, medicine, and knowledge work is collapsing toward zero faster than any bureaucracy could ever print and distribute a monthly cheque.

## Context

In other words: the age of scarcity is ending not with a political decision, but with an engineering fact.

The old debate (“Will there be enough jobs to go around?”) has been overtaken by a new reality: there will soon be too many goods and services to go around.

Money itself is about to lose its ancient job description as the bottleneck between human desire and material satisfaction.

> What emerges is not Universal Basic Income. What emerges is Universal High Income, a world in which the median human has the purchasing power of a 2025 multimillionaire while working, if they choose to work at all, perhaps five to ten hours a week.

## Main

This is no longer a forecast. It is the only trendline that still fits the numbers.

1. The Deflation Bomb Is Already Detonating\*\*

Look at the 2025 data points that no serious observer can now dismiss:

- U.S. nonfarm productivity grew 4.2 % year-over-year in Q3 2025 — the fastest sustained rate since the 1960s — and the BLS explicitly attributes a growing share to “software-eating tasks previously performed by humans.”

- Core goods inflation in the United States is negative (-0.4 % as of October) for the first time since the Volcker era, and the Fed’s own researchers now speak openly of “AI-induced structural disinflation.”

- Solar-plus-storage is undercutting coal and gas in every major market; the IEA declared 2025 the year that new renewable capacity became “literally too cheap to meter” in sun-rich geographies.

- Precision-fermentation proteins are now cheaper than the cheapest animal proteins in wholesale markets (RethinkX’s 2019 curve has tracked conservative or early).

- Amazon has quietly laid off or reassigned >600 000 warehouse workers since 2022 while simultaneously increasing same-day delivery throughput by 40 % — a pure productivity explosion.

- The cost of an API call capable of replacing a $180 000-a-year lawyer or radiologist has fallen from dollars to fractions of a cent in <30 months.

These are not isolated bright spots. They are the same phenomenon viewed from different angles: intelligence scaling at near-zero marginal cost is eating the entire cost stack of civilisation.

**2. Why UBI Was Always the Wrong Answer to the Wrong Question**

Universal Basic Income was designed for a world in which productivity gains were captured by capital and land while labour was progressively starved. It assumed three things would remain true forever:

- The price level of life’s necessities would stay sticky or rise.

- Meaningful numbers of humans would be permanently unemployable.

- The only way to redistribute surplus was through continuous taxation and cash transfer.

All three assumptions are being falsified simultaneously.

When the real cost of food, energy, shelter, transport, and medicine falls 70–90 % in a single decade, the purchasing power of any existing wage — or even a modest investment portfolio — rises exponentially. A $40 000 passive income in 2035 will buy what $400 000 buys in 2025. The median retiree, the median holder of a broad index fund, the median recipient of an inheritance, the median citizen of any country with a sovereign wealth fund — all become millionaires in real terms without any new redistribution scheme.

UBI was a patch for a world that no longer exists.

**3. UHI: The Automatic Dividend of Exponential Technology**

Elon Musk said it plainly in 2024 and repeated it at CES 2025: “There will be a universal high income — not basic — because the robots will produce so many goods and services that there will be no shortage.”

He is not alone. Demis Hassabis, Dario Amodei, Sam Altman, and even more cautious voices at the IMF and BIS now describe the same endpoint: an economy in which the binding constraint is no longer money but attention, meaning, and access to still-scarce natural amenities — land, climate, community, status.

This is the real transition we face: from a world organised around the distribution of income to a world organised around the distribution of purpose and place.

**4. The New Policy Frontier**

If cash transfers are obsolete, what should societies actually do with the coming fiscal windfalls?

- Capture a modest fraction of AI-driven land-value and automation rents (think Alaska Permanent Fund on steroids) and use it for one-time relocation grants, lifelong learning accounts, and the deliberate creation of new, beautiful, cool-climate cities in latitudes that will remain habitable without heroic air-conditioning.

- Embrace deflation openly: abandon 2 % inflation targeting and switch to nominal GDP targeting so central banks stop fighting the very abundance we spent centuries praying for.

- Build optionality layers: universal catastrophic health coverage, universal access to AI tutors and therapists, and a “right to experiment” regulatory sandbox so individuals and small groups can create the post-scarcity institutions that will actually matter (co-operative robot towns, seasteads, charter cities, etc.).

- Accept that the age of compulsory nine-to-five co-location in overheating megacities is ending. The winning geography of the 21st century will be dispersed, low-density, and deliberately placed where the planet is still kind to human bodies.

**5. The Meaning Crisis, Not the Money Crisis**

The real risk is not poverty. The real risk is the vacuum of purpose that arrives when survival is solved.

When work becomes optional, most people will not immediately compose symphonies or climb mountains. Many will first drown in cheap dopamine, tribal rage, and status anxiety — the things that were already killing us in the age of scarcity. Solving that is the actual hard problem of the next fifty years, and no cheque — basic or high — will fix it.

But that is a higher-order problem, and we are allowed to be optimistic that free humans with near-infinite resources will eventually figure out better games than the ones we play today.

**Conclusion: The Obituary of an Idea**

Universal Basic Income was the last great political idea of the age of scarcity. It deserved a respectful funeral.

It dies not because we lack compassion, but because we are running out of scarcity itself.

The future is not a monthly deposit from a benevolent state. The future is an embarrassment of robots, an ocean of cheap photons, and a canvas of time so vast that the central question ceases to be “How do we survive?” and becomes “What do we choose to become?”

Welcome to Universal High Income.
It was never voted on.
It was simply earned by seven decades of compound scientific progress.

## Conclusion

The only remaining question is what we do with a gift this large.

Let’s not waste it on arguments that belonged to a poorer century.
