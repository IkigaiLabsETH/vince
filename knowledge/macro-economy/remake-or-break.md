In the electrifying arena of modern finance, where trillions chase the next big thing, Howard Marks—co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management and a veteran bubble-spotter—has dropped a memo that’s part history thriller, part economic prophecy. Dated December 9, 2025, “Is It a Bubble?” is an 18-page deep dive into the AI frenzy, blending sharp analysis with historical echoes that will make even the most bullish investor pause. Marks, no AI evangelist but a keen observer of human folly, warns that we’re in the grip of a classic “inflection bubble”—one that could propel humanity forward like railroads or the internet, but only after incinerating vast fortunes along the way.

Drawing from his travels in Asia and the Middle East, where clients grilled him on AI’s sustainability, Marks kicks off with a timeless observation: Bubbles aren’t random; they’re rhythmic. “Memories are short, and prudence and natural risk aversion are no match for the dream of getting rich on the back of a revolutionary technology that ‘everyone knows’ will change the world.” Quoting Derek Thompson’s newsletter, he draws a striking parallel to the 1860s railroad boom—a speculative mania that built empires but bankrupted multitudes. History doesn’t repeat, but as Mark Twain allegedly quipped, it rhymes.

## Context

**Bubbles: The Good, the Bad, and the Wealth-Destroying**

Marks clarifies a key point: Not all bubbles are equal. Citing Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber’s Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation, he distinguishes “mean-reversion bubbles” (like subprime mortgages, pure financial illusions that vanish) from “inflection bubbles” (like railroads or broadband), which accelerate progress by flooding risky experiments with capital. As Carlota Perez argued in her post-dot-com classic Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital, these manias fund the “Installation Phase”—wild, money-losing builds that pave the way for profitable “Deployment.”

The railroads transformed America, but investors got torched. AI, Marks argues, fits this mold: a “collective vision” that compresses decades of innovation into years, fueled by FOMO and trillions in bets.

## Main

Yet, even “good” bubbles destroy wealth. Hobart and Huber celebrate them as catalysts for breakthroughs, but Marks counters: “The key is to not be one of the investors whose wealth is destroyed in the process of bringing on progress.”

In AI’s case, the hype is palpable—Nvidia’s valuation rocketed from $626 million in 1999 to a brief $5 trillion in 2025, an 8,000-fold surge. AI drives 75% of S&P 500 gains, 80% of profits, and 90% of capex, per Fortune. But beneath the glow? Profound uncertainties.

**The AI Arms Race: Trillions Bet, Winners Unknown**

Marks paints a vivid picture of AI’s dominance: It’s devouring corporate budgets, boosting GDP, and injecting euphoria into markets. Yet, questions abound. Who wins—tech titans like Microsoft and Google, or upstarts like Etched, which raised $120 million on a bold bet: “If transformers go away, we’ll die. But if they stick around, we’re the biggest company of all time”? Marks crunches the “lottery-ticket” math: A 0.1% shot at $1 trillion justifies the investment, but sanity must prevail amid trillion-dollar dreams.

**Will AI generate profits, and for whom? **

Marks wonders if it’ll be a lucrative monopoly or a cutthroat commodity. ChatGPT loses money per query—loss leaders for now, but sustainable? For users, AI promises productivity leaps, like replacing workers with algorithms, but could spark price wars that erode margins, passing savings to consumers instead. Echoing Warren Buffett on autos: The car revolutionized America but ruined most investors.

Then there’s the red flag of “circular deals,” evoking 1990s telecom illusions. OpenAI pledges $1.4 trillion to partners, funded by revenues from those same entities—Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which buys Nvidia chips. Goldman Sachs pegs 15% of Nvidia’s 2026 sales from such loops. Is it synergy or sleight of hand? Marks muses on trillions: A million is a dollar a second for 11 days; a billion, 31 years; a trillion? 31,700 years—mind-boggling scale.

Obsolescence looms large. AI chips’ lifespan? Chinese open-source models now outpace U.S. giants in downloads, per MIT. Nvidia shed $115 billion in a day on Google AI fears. “Dynamic change creates opportunity,” Marks notes, “but threatens leaders’ reign.”

**Debt: Fueling the Fire, Risking the Inferno**

Here’s where Marks sounds the alarm: The shift to debt. Early AI was equity-funded by cash-rich hyperscalers. Now, JPMorgan estimates $5 trillion for infrastructure—half a trillion in 2026 alone—with big players like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle holding just $350 billion collectively. Oracle, Meta, and Alphabet issue 30-year bonds at slim premiums over Treasurys—prudent for 30 years of tech chaos?

Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson contrasts “healthy” giants (with customers and cash) against “unhealthy” startups borrowing billions sans profits. Risks include speculative assets, lender incentives misaligned, supply glut, chip obsolescence, and price-cutting wars. Azeem Azhar warns of a “Minsky moment”: Credit chases bad bets, vendor financing spreads, coverage ratios thin.

Off-balance-sheet SPVs—infamous from Enron—hide debt, backed by shaky rents. Debt magnifies losses, hikes failure odds, and endangers lenders. A data center oversupply could bankrupt owners, enabling “creative destruction” as vultures buy cheap. Oaktree and Brookfield dabble prudently—$10 billion fund for underserved areas—but Marks stresses: Debt for predictable flows, equity for speculation. Mix wrong, and disaster ensues.

Bob O’Leary, Oaktree’s co-CEO, adds: Tech is winner-takes-all. Equity rewards the home run; debt collects coupons on winners but craters on losers. Early stars like Lycos or MySpace faded—diversify equity, but debt pools spell doom.

Historical Ghosts: Radio, Aviation, and Why AI Might RhymeMarks scours history for parallels. AI echoes radio’s 1920s bubble: RCA, “the Nvidia of its day,” soared then crashed 97%, contributing to the Great Depression. Post-Lindbergh aviation? Stocks plunged 96% amid overhyped viability. Railroads, electricity, broadband—all bubbled, transformed, corrected.

Skeptics see mirrors: World-changing tech, FOMO, SPVs, $1-2 billion seeds for product-less startups like Thinking Machines Lab (now eyeing $50 billion) or Safe Superintelligence ($32 billion in stealth). Supporters rebut: Real products, one billion users (vs. bubble-era internet’s few), revenue explosions (Anthropic 100x in two years), no IPO madness.

On valuations, Goldman Sachs data shows today’s leaders like Nvidia (30x forward P/E), Microsoft (32x), and Alphabet (22x) are far saner than 1999’s Microsoft (69x), Cisco (101x), and Oracle (90x). Medians: 31x now vs. 41x then. Sam Altman captures the duality: “Are we overexcited about A.I.? Yes. Is A.I. the most important thing in a very long time? Also yes.”

**AI’s Darker Shadow: Job Apocalypse and Societal Rift**

In a haunting postscript, Marks shifts to philosophy. AI isn’t just a tool—it’s a cognition replacement, advancing at warp speed. Coding? AI outperforms humans. Ad matching? No people needed. Demand? Unpredictable—tomorrow’s AI could do 100x today’s tasks.

The terror: Mass unemployment. Vanguard’s Joe Davis predicts 43% time savings per job. Marks fears entry-level workers, bureaucrats, junior lawyers, drivers (America’s top profession) vanishing. Universal basic income? Checks for the jobless, but funding woes amid deficits, plus jobs provide purpose, structure, self-respect. Without them, opioid crises and shortened lives worsen. Who trains experts if juniors disappear? Coastal billionaires displacing millions could fuel populism.

Yet, a glimmer: 16 million boomers retire by 2035—AI might fill gaps. Marks pleads: Optimists, prove me wrong. He misses simpler times.

**Brace for the Pop: No All-In Bets**

Marks’ verdict: Exuberance reigns; irrationality? Time will tell, but history suggests overbuild and correction. Debt amplifies peril. No all-in or all-out—moderate, selective bets. Data centers aren’t magic; they demand judgment.In this trillion-dollar gamble, Marks’ memo is a clarion call: AI could be the 21st century’s railroad—transformative, but brace for pain.

Will it defy patterns? Trillions hang in the balance.

## Conclusion

Investors, dream boldly, but tread wisely.

The future’s bright, but bubbles burst.
