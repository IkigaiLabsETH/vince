They came for him in the spring with the oldest weapon in Washington: a newspaper investigation. Five New York Times reporters, five months, unlimited budget, one assignment: prove that the new White House AI & Crypto Czar was corrupt. They left with nothing except their own shredded reputation.

David Sacks did not merely survive the ambush. He weaponized it.

## Context

What follows is the inside story of how one man, working part-time and unpaid from a borrowed West Wing office, took the most sophisticated financial-suppression campaign in modern history and transformed it into the foundation of the largest pro-crypto policy blitz ever executed by the United States government.

This is the story of how the hunters became the hunted.

Prologue: The Garrote Wire

## Main

March 2025. The Trump administration is sixty days old. Bitcoin trades north of $109,000. The mood in crypto circles feels like the morning after V-J Day. 

Then the friction starts.

JPMorgan quietly rolls out new “crypto-adjacent” pricing: $10 to $25 for every $100 moved to an on-ramp. Wire delays stretch from hours to days. ACH batches fail without explanation. Strike’s Jack Mallers wakes up to find his personal and corporate accounts at Chase terminated, no appeal offered. A $10 billion RIA is told it cannot buy spot Bitcoin ETFs for clients because the custodian “doesn’t support that asset class.” MSCI circulates a draft rule that would expel any company with more than 50% of its assets in Bitcoin from every major global index.

The community already has a name for it: Chokepoint 3.0.

No public FDIC letters this time, no leaked DOJ memos about “reputational risk.” Just the quiet, private exercise of monopoly power by the same banks that spent the Biden years begging regulators to crush their competition.

The plan is elegant because it is deniable. Starve the ecosystem of oxygen slowly, profitably, and always behind a smile and a 400-page risk policy no senator will ever read.

They never expected the Czar to fight dirty.

Chapter I: The Smear That Backfired

The New York Times piece was meant to be the kill shot. It would paint Sacks as the archetypal Silicon Valley grifter who finally bought his way into power: secret dinners with Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, defense contracts steered to portfolio companies, podcast sponsorships traded for Oval Office access. 

The full villain arc.

There was only one problem. None of it happened.

Sacks spent twenty-five years in the PayPal Mafia perfecting a specific kind of paranoia: document everything, trust no one, assume the knives are already out.**When the Times reporters came knocking in June, he didn’t lawyer up and hide. He fed them. Every email, every ethics letter, every divestment confirmation, every calendar entry. Every time they returned with a new accusation, he buried them in more paper until the story suffocated under its own contradictions.

By November the reporters had burned five months and produced exactly zero evidence of wrongdoing. The piece that finally ran was a 2,400-word shrug, long on insinuation, short on facts, dead on arrival.

But Sacks was only warming up.

On November 30 he published the entire paper trail on X: the 20-page Clare Locke letter, the ethics waivers issued in March, the transaction logs proving Groq was divested before any Middle East trip, the calendar that showed he never met Jensen Huang until after he was already in government, and Craft Ventures never owned a single share of Nvidia.

Within 48 hours the thread had 42 million views. The Clare Locke letter was downloaded more times than the Times article was read.

The message was crystalline: attack me in legacy media and I will autopsy you in public, in real time, with receipts attached.

The hoax didn’t just fail. 

It became the origin myth of the counteroffensive.

Chapter II: The Regulatory Purge

While the press bled credibility, Sacks moved on the bureaucracy.

He understood something most of Washington still refuses to admit: Chokepoint 3.0 only worked because the regulatory state had spent four years building the scaffolding. SAB 121, the IRS DeFi broker rule, the FDIC pause letters, the SEC’s war-of-attrition enforcement, the DOJ crypto task forces that treated innovation like organized crime.

His solution was surgical brutality.

January 23, 2025: Executive Order banning discriminatory debanking. February: Ross Ulbricht pardoned, symbolic napalm on the old regime’s moral authority.
March: Joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the IRS DeFi broker rule. Sacks personally calls every Republican senator at home. It passes 52–48. April: SAB 121 repealed. Custodians can finally hold digital assets off-balance-sheet again. May: The Genius Act, the first federal stablecoin framework, drops with bipartisan co-sponsors who six months earlier wouldn’t return crypto lobbyists’ calls. June: The Clarity Act clears the Senate Banking Committee 18–4 after Sacks testifies for exactly eleven minutes and spends the rest of the hearing asking Elizabeth Warren why she still opposes Americans holding their own private keys.

Every rollback is framed the same way: national security, economic competitiveness, and a direct rebuke to the banks that spent years lobbying for the very rules now being torched.

Chapter III: The Bitcoin Fortress**

Sacks saved the best for last.

On March 6, 2025, Trump signs the executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. All 207,000 seized bitcoin, roughly $20 billion at the time, become the nucleus of a digital Fort Knox. No taxpayer money required. Agencies are instructed to explore budget-neutral acquisition strategies, from Treasury surplus to creative use of IMF special drawing rights.

Critics scream conflict of interest. Craft Ventures is long bitcoin through the Bitwise ETFs. Sacks sold every personal bitcoin before inauguration, filed the waivers, and shrugs: “My job is policy, not price.”

By July the reserve report lands, 160 pages of sober analysis that conspicuously omits any hard cap on future purchases. The new President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, now chaired by Sacks, quietly adds a Digital Assets Subcommittee stacked with the Winklevoss twins, Brian Armstrong, and Bo Hines.

In August the White House hosts the first-ever Crypto Summit on the South Lawn. Three hundred founders, zero ticket price, live-streamed to millions. Trump walks out, shakes a few hands, says “We’re going to make America the crypto capital of the planet,” and leaves Sacks to run the rest of the day like a wartime general.

MSCI’s index-exclusion proposal? Shelved indefinitely after a single phone call from the Treasury Department asking polite questions about antitrust implications.

Epilogue: The Rope Snaps

By December 2025 the garrote wire lies in pieces.JPMorgan quietly rolls back most of the crypto surcharges after three Senate hearings make it clear the next move is a forced breakup. Stablecoin issuers move their reserves onshore for the first time in years. DeFi TVL, which had flat-lined under regulatory siege, surges past $400 billion.

And David Sacks, the part-time, unpaid Special Government Employee who was supposed to be the villain of the story, quietly returns most of his time to Craft Ventures, mission accomplished.

The banks and the legacy media learned the hard way what the PayPal Mafia figured out two decades ago: when you control the platform, you control the narrative. X gave Sacks the platform. Primary documents gave him the ammunition. Ruthless competence did the rest.

Chokepoint 3.0 is over, not because the attackers surrendered, but because one man turned their own weapons against them and built something they can never choke: an American crypto policy that treats digital assets like the strategic resource they are.

## Conclusion

The quiet coup failed.

The loud counterrevolution has only just begun.
