I’m staring at the same executive order PDF I’ve had open for four days. My phone just buzzed with a push alert: “Trump EO to let 401(k)s buy crypto.” I laughed so hard I almost spilled coffee on the cat. The cat didn’t move. He’s seen this movie before.

Look, I’ve been writing about this shit since 2009. Back when you could buy a pizza with 10,000 BTC and the only people who cared were libertarians arguing on Bitcointalk about whether Satoshi was actually a time traveler. I filed stories from my apartment in Bushwick while the neighbors screamed about rent, and every editor after editor told me “nobody gives a fuck about magic internet money, kid.”

Fast-forward sixteen years and the same government that once sent armed agents to shut down e-gold is now begging the SEC to pretty-please let Grandma put 3% of her nest egg into the orange coin. I should be throwing a parade.

Instead I’m just… tired.

Here’s the thing nobody wants to say out loud: this 401(k) thing is probably the biggest structural demand shock Bitcoin will ever see, and it still might not matter for another three years because bureaucrats move at the speed of continental drift. Trump signed the order in August. Some House guys sent a strongly-worded letter in September. The DOL has until February to propose rules, then there’s a comment period, then lawsuits, then appeals, then Fidelity’s legal department will spend eighteen months making sure they can’t get sued into the stone age if Bitcoin dumps 60% the week after they flip the switch. We’re talking 2027 or 2028 before your HR department actually adds “Bitcoin ETF – 2% allocation” to the dropdown menu next to the mid-cap growth fund.

But when it does happen? Jesus. Twelve and a half trillion dollars. That’s not a number go up hype. That’s half the U.S. equity market sitting in accounts that rebalance every payday whether you’re paying attention or not. If even one percent trickles in over five years that’s $125 billion. One percent. Most target-date funds already have 4-6% in “alternatives.” You telling me they won’t find room for a little Bitcoin slice once the lawyers sign off?

I’m old enough to remember when the narrative was “institutions will never touch this.” Then MicroStrategy. Then Tesla. Then the ETFs. Every single time the price doubled or tripled and then everyone pretended they’d been bullish all along. This one’s different though. This isn’t some hedge-fund bro aping in with leverage. This is your dad—who still calls it “Bit-Coin” like it’s two words—checking a box on his annual enrollment form because the default option says “diversified digital assets.” That’s not speculation. That’s the slow, boring, unstoppable grind of compound interest finally pointing at the hardest asset humanity’s ever invented.

The irony makes me want to scream. Ten years ago I got dragged into a meeting with a Big Bank’s wealth-management team. They flew me out, put me up in a hotel that smelled like lemon polish and despair, and spent two hours explaining why Bitcoin could never be in a client portfolio because “fiduciary duty.” I asked them if they owned emerging-market debt or high-yield junk bonds. Of course they did. I asked if those had ever defaulted. Silence. I got a polite email the next week saying they’d decided not to run the piece. Shocker.

Now BlackRock—the temple of fiduciary duty itself—is out here publishing white papers saying yeah, actually 5-8% Bitcoin is fine for millennials. Vanguard, the church of Bogle, just quietly let Bitcoin ETFs into their brokerage window. State pensions are buying. Houston firefighters are holding actual keys. The same people who fire you for being down two percent in a quarter are now the bagholders of last resort. I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Could be wrong here, obviously. Volatility’s still a monster. If we get another 2022-style contagion and Bitcoin goes to $38k right as the first wave of 401(k) money hits, there will be congressional hearings, tears on CNBC, and probably a five-year rollback. Retirees who bought the top in 2021 are still waiting to break even. Never forget that part. Never.

But the supply schedule doesn’t care about your feelings. 900 new coins a day right now, dropping to 450 in April 2028, then 225, then… you know the rest. Meanwhile the demand side is about to get the biggest lazy river of capital ever built pointed straight at it. Not traders. Not degens. Just millions of people auto-deducting $50 a paycheck into whatever BlackRock calls their Bitcoin fund because the risk questionnaire said they could handle “moderate volatility.”

I’m not saying we’re going to $250k next quarter. I’m saying that once this spigot turns on—even a little—the bid underneath the market becomes permanent in a way it’s never been before. And the people who’ve been waiting for “real adoption” are about to find out what it actually feels like when the normies show up late, overweight, and planning to hold until they’re dead.

Anyway. I’m gonna finish my coffee, close the laptop, and try to sleep before the sun comes up. If you’ve got a 401(k), maybe log in tomorrow and see if they’ve added the crypto box yet. Probably not. But one day they will. And when that quarterly statement shows up with a new line that says “Digital Asset Fund – 3%, just remember some of us have been screaming into this void since MySpace was a thing.

Night, internet. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. Which isn’t much these days.
