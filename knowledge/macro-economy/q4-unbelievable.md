The quarter is on track for roughly -22%, marking one of the worst Q4 performances in history, second only to 2018’s bloodbath.

I remember scrolling through timelines in September, filled with confident calls: “Uptober incoming,” “Q4 unbelievable,” Eric Trump himself promising fireworks.

## Context

Instead, we got a slow bleed, ETF outflows, and a market that feels exhausted.

No euphoria. Just quiet capitulation.

This isn’t the cycle we were sold.

## Main

**The Broken Narrative**

Bitcoin’s historical quarterly returns table—[courtesy of Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/today)—has long been a talisman for bulls. Q4 averages +77%, medians +47%.

It’s delivered monsters: +168% in 2020, +215% in 2017.

2025 flipped it red. Deep red.

The pain isn’t just numerical. It’s psychological.

Everyone expected the seasonal pump. Institutions piled in via ETFs all year. Corporate treasuries loaded up. A pro-crypto administration took office.
\*\*
Yet here we are: Bitcoin down year-to-date in some measures, alts crushed harder, sentiment at lows not seen since 2022. Crypto Twitter is a graveyard of irony. Memes of “How Q4 started vs. how it’s going.” Threads calling it the “second-worst Q4 ever.” Influencers like Daan Crypto noting the messy year: massive inflows matched by whale selling and cycle exhaustion.

What Went Wrong?\*\*

No single villain. A confluence.

First, macro headwinds. The Fed cut rates but signaled fewer ahead—sticky inflation, resilient jobs. Real yields ticked up. Risk assets suffered. Bitcoin’s correlation to Nasdaq hit highs not seen in years.

Second, ETF reality check. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw billions in outflows starting November—BlackRock’s IBIT alone bled over $2.7 billion in its longest streak. Institutions took profits, unwound basis trades, de-risked into year-end.

Third, leverage unwind. Cascading liquidations in a thinning liquidity environment. Weekends turned vicious.

Fourth, plain old profit-taking after the rally to $126,000. Whales distributed. On-chain data showed capitulation, but not full bear-market levels.
\*\*
It wasn’t a crash. It was a grind down. Death by a thousand cuts.

Subtle irony: The more “mature” Bitcoin becomes—institutional adoption, ETFs, treasury status—the more it behaves like a high-beta tech stock. Less independent monetary asset, more risk-on play.

That’s the skepticism I can’t shake.

The Halving Cycle Debate: Dead or Just Sleeping?\*\*
\*\*
This correction has reignited the oldest argument in Bitcoin: Is the four-year halving cycle still king? Traditionalists say yes. Peaks ~18 months post-halving (October 2025 fit perfectly), then bear into year three (2026).

History rhymes: 2014-15, 2018-19, 2022-23—brutal draws.

But a growing chorus—Grayscale, Bitwise, Fundstrat—declares it broken or extended. Why? ETFs changed everything. Permanent institutional bid. Slower, steadier inflows. Lower volatility. Grayscale’s 2026 outlook: “Dawn of the Institutional Era.” New ATHs in H1 2026. Cycle ends. Bitwise: “Massive” year ahead. Four-year pattern dead. Standard Chartered revised down but still sees upside from flows. Even Tom Lee: New highs early 2026 via untapped retail/institutional channels.

The data leans their way. Post-halving gains muted compared to prior cycles. Volatility compressed. Supply absorbed quietly.

Yet I remain cautious. Cycles don’t die easily. They evolve, sure—but psychology lingers. If everyone bets on “no bear in 2026,” the setup for disappointment grows.

2026 Forecasts: The Spread

Analysts cluster bullish, but ranges wide.

- Conservative: $120,000–$170,000

- Consensus: $150,000–$200,000

- Optimistic: $200,000–$250,000+

> Bear cases exist quietly: Deeper correction to $70,000–$80,000 if cycle holds. Elliott Wave types whispering $40,000–$56,000.

My take:

Structural tailwinds real—ETF maturation, regulatory clarity, potential state/national reserves, corporate adoption. But valuations stretched. Bitcoin at $88,000 trades ~40x realized cap in some metrics.

Risk/reward skewed short-term.

Historical Analogies: Proceed with Caution\*\*

2017: Parabolic top, then 2018 crash.

2021: Similar euphoria, then 2022 bear.

2025: Topped on institutional apathy, not retail mania. QT ending echoed 2019. That 2019 analogy intrigues. Topped quietly, then grinded before recovery.

But differences matter. No Terra/Luna, no FTX this time. Cleaner balance sheets. Still, history warns: Post-peak quarters brutal.

**Thinking Clearly About Risks**

Long-term, I’m optimistic. Bitcoin’s fundamentals—fixed supply, network effects, growing sovereignty hedge—intact.

Short-to-medium: Risks abound.

- Tighter policy surprises.

- Renewed outflows.

- Broader equity sell-off spilling over.

- Cycle psychology reasserting.

Don’t confuse maturity with immunity to drawdowns.

**Positioning for 2026**

If the cycle truly broken, we grind higher: New highs mid-year, $150,000–$200,000 realistic. If not, 2026 tests supports deeply before rebound.

Either way, volatility ahead.

## Conclusion

My advice remains boring: Accumulate gradually. Ignore noise. Size positions you can sleep with. No sugarcoating: This quarter humbled us all. But markets reward patience. If Q4 was the cleanse, perhaps Q1 2026 delivers what we expected all along.Or perhaps not. That’s the beauty—and terror—of Bitcoin.

Stay clear-headed out there.
