In a city that smells faintly of chocolate and gunpowder residue from centuries of grudges, 210 billion of someone else’s money sleeps inside a neutral vault called Euroclear. For fifty-five years the world trusted that vault the way it once trusted Swiss banks: it did not pick sides, it simply kept the keys.

Now Brussels wants the interest—€3–5 billion a year—skimmed off the top, forced into zero-yield EU bonds, and lent to Ukraine on the understanding that repayment arrives the same day Russia sends a handwritten apology and a fruit basket. No one calls it confiscation. That would be crude. This is merely creative accounting dressed in a three-piece suit.

## Context

There are, however, complications.

**1. The Flemish Dragon**
**
Belgium is on the hook for roughly 200 billion in potential Russian lawsuits. Prime Minister calls it an “existential threat to the euro.” The Commission offers legal shields that Belgium’s own experts say are €100–150 billion short and expire the moment sanctions do. Bart De Wever, the quiet Flemish leader who currently holds the real veto, has twice dined with the Queen of the Berlaymont and twice gone home with the keys still in his pocket. In any normal empire this would be high treason. In the consociational kingdom of the EU it is simply Tuesday.

2. The Vanishing Contracts**
**
Remember the €35 billion vaccine deal sealed by private text message between Ursula von der Leyen and the CEO of Pfizer? A Luxembourg court ordered the Commission to produce the messages. The Commission looked under the cushions, checked the fridge, and announced—with the serene confidence of a magician who has sawed the lady in half—that the texts had simply ceased to exist. Transparency, European style: paperwork so light it achieves escape velocity.

## Main

3. The Inquisition**
**
When a South African rocket builder turned a $8 verification tick into a punchline, Brussels declared war on laughter itself. €120 million fine and counting. Meanwhile the Commission’s press team briefly hijacked a dormant account, exploited a platform glitch to get free viral reach worth millions, and celebrated its victory over “deceptive practices” until Twitter’s engineers pulled the plug with a shrug. Physician, heal thyself.

In 2024 the European Union raked in €3.4–3.8 billion by fining a handful of American tech giants (mostly Apple, Meta and Google), yet the entire combined corporate income tax paid by every publicly listed home-grown European internet and tech company came to barely €3.0–3.5 billion. 

Put another way: the EU now makes more money shaking down five companies in California than it collects in tax from everything it ever managed to build itself between Lisbon and Tallinn. That is not a regulatory triumph. That is a confession. 

4. The Silent Exodus**
**
Central banks from Riyadh to Singapore are already moving assets out of Euroclear. Not in panic—central bankers do not panic—but the way you quietly shift your chair when the man beside you starts playing with matches. Every billion that leaves is a pensioner in Düsseldorf who will retire later, a factory in Limburg that will never reopen, a start-up in Lisbon that will incorporate in Delaware instead.

5. The American Autopsy**
**
In December 2025 Jamie Dimon said the quiet part out loud: Europe’s problem is Europe. Twenty-seven cooks, one kitchen, and the recipe is written in committee. The continent has gone from 90 % of US GDP to 65 % in a single generation, not because America stole anything but because Europe regulated, subsidised, and litigated its own future into the ground. The welfare state is still plush. The factories are cold. The brightest graduates book one-way tickets to Austin or Shenzhen. And the war chest that was supposed to save the day is locked behind a Flemish dragon who refuses to gamble his children’s future on Brussels parchment.

## Conclusion

6. The Old Promise**
> 
Europe was built on a single solemn vow: never again. No more brothers’ wars, no more trenches from the Channel to the Urals. Somewhere along the way “never again” acquired a price tag measured in hundreds of billions, a handful of deleted text messages, and a neutral vault that may never be neutral again. The lights in the Berlaymont still burn past midnight. Printers hum with new legal incantations, new shields, new exceptions that expire at dawn. But the vault remains closed. The dragon has gone home to Antwerp. And every prince at the table has just been reminded of the oldest rule of this strange kingdom: Even the smallest claw can rip out the empire’s throat.

Sleep well.
The keys have a habit of turning when no one is looking.
And some questions, once asked, do not go back to sleep.
