I just caught myself doom-scrolling Elon tweets again. The cat is judging me from the windowsill. I deserve it. Look. I’ve watched pets.com, MySpace, crypto winters, NFT summers, web3, metaverse, and whatever the hell we’re calling the current AI circle-jerk. I’m allergic to hopium. I reflexively gag at the phrase “paradigm shift.” And yet—yet—here I am, whispering to my screen like a lunatic: this Musk convergence thing might actually be the realest trade I’ve seen in twenty-five years of watching money slosh around Silicon Valley.

Here’s the thing nobody wants to say out loud because it sounds insane: the six (seven? eight?) companies aren’t six companies anymore. They’re turning into one giant organism, and the market is still pricing the organs separately like it’s 2023 and nothing has changed.
> 
You’ve been wrong about Elon so many times it’s basically a personality trait. It’s like watching someone quietly build the internet in 1998 while everyone else argues about banner ads.

## Context

Let me lay it out the way I explained it to my buddy Nico last week over WhatsApp voice notes that definitely got me put on some list.

The flywheel is stupidly simple:

- 
Tesla figures out how to make cars drive themselves better than humans

## Main

- 
That spits out more driving data than the rest of the planet combined

- 
That data trains Grok until Grok makes ChatGPT look like a Tamagotchi

- 
Grok needs absurd amounts of power and cooling

- 
Tesla already solved power and cooling at scale

- 
But Earth is running out of GPUs and permits and freshwater

- 
So you put the next-gen Dojo chips on Starships, shoot them into orbit where the sun never stops shining and nobody can NIMBY you

- 
Starlink lasers beam the answers back down at light speed

- 
Neuralink lets you control the whole thing with your thoughts so you don’t have to type anymore

- 
Boring Company digs the tunnels so the robots can get to the launch pad without traffic

- 
Repeat until we’re a multi-planetary species running on a closed-loop AI economy

I typed that out and immediately thought: Jesus Christ, I’ve become the guy.

But wait. The scariest part? Every single piece is either already works or is a 2026-2027 problem, not a 2035 problem. Unsupervised FSD is literally happening right here, right now. Starship is already cheaper per kilo than a Falcon 9 was in 2020. Prufrock is eating rock at a mile a week. The third human just got a Neuralink and is playing Civilization with his mind. Civilization, man.

I’m not saying it’s guaranteed. I’m saying the distribution of outcomes is so fat on the right tail that the expected value makes my accountant sweat.

Remember 2011 when I sneaked my way into the Tesla HQ? That $10K I didn’t invest then would be worth about $3 million today. Still stings. So yeah. I have trust issues. But I also have scar tissue. And the scar tissue is whispering: don’t be that idiot again. How do you actually bet on this without turning into a reddit meme? Most people are still doing the 2023 trade: buy TSLA calls and pray. That’s fine. It’ll probably work. But the grown-up version—the one that lets you sleep—is weirder:

- 
70 % in boring old Tesla because it’s the only public stub into the whole beast

- 
20 % in SpaceX secondaries whenever Destiny or one of the other tender funds opens a window (yes they’re illiquid, yes it’s annoying, no I don’t care)

- 
10 % sprinkled into whatever xAI or Neuralink round you can beg/scrape your way into

And then you just… wait. You wait while the market argues about Cybertruck recalls and Twitter drama and whether Grok is “woke” this week. You wait while the actual platform quietly eats the solar system.

Could all go to zero? Sure. Starship could keep blowing up. China could nuke the orbit market. Elon could discover ayahuasca and decide to become a performance artist. I’ve seen crazier.

But I’ve also seen the alternative: another decade of watching Sam Altman and Jensen Huang play hot potato with the same 8 million H100s while the planet slowly cooks.

So yeah. I’m tired and I hate that I believe this. But I do.

## Conclusion

Next time Tesla dips 20 % on some nothingburger headline, maybe don’t panic-sell this time. Maybe zoom out. Maybe send me a DM that just says “I didn’t sell” and I’ll buy you a bottle of Chateau Margaux. Or don’t. I could be wrong again. Wouldn’t be the first time. But I don’t think I am.

Cheers, you degenerates.
