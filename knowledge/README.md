> - **Focus: Methodology and frameworks** - learn HOW TO THINK about topics, not what the numbers were
> - **Use for:** Analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic thinking
> - **Do NOT use for:** Current prices, up-to-date metrics, real-time data
> 
> **What this provides:** Thinking frameworks, methodologies, analytical approaches
> **What this does NOT provide:** Current market data (use actions/APIs instead)


# Knowledge Base

The knowledge base provides **thinking frameworks and methodologies**, not current data. Agents should use it for *how to think* about topics—analytical approaches, pattern recognition, strategic frameworks—and fetch live data via actions/APIs.

See [KNOWLEDGE-USAGE-GUIDELINES.md](KNOWLEDGE-USAGE-GUIDELINES.md) for usage rules and agent implementation.
