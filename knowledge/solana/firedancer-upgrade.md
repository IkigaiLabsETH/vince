# Firedancer: Jump Crypto's Solana Validator Client

## What Firedancer Changes

### Performance
Firedancer's architecture is fundamentally different from the Agave client. Key design choices:
- **Tile-based architecture:** Modular components (networking, signature verification, execution, etc.) run as independent "tiles" that can be assigned to specific CPU cores, maximizing parallelism.
- **Zero-copy networking:** Custom networking stack bypasses the kernel, reducing latency and increasing packet processing throughput.
- **Benchmarks:** Internal testing showed 1M+ TPS in controlled environments. Real-world mainnet performance will be lower, but even 10-100x improvement over current throughput opens new design spaces.

Signature verification alone was benchmarked at 1M+ signatures per second — a bottleneck that currently limits the Agave client.

### Client Diversity
Before Firedancer, a single bug in the Agave client could halt the entire network. With two independent implementations reaching consensus on the same state, a bug in one client only affects validators running that implementation. The network can continue with the other client's supermajority.

This is arguably more important than the performance gains. Solana's outage history traces largely to single-client vulnerabilities.

### Frankendancer — The Intermediate Step
Rather than deploying the full Firedancer stack at once, Jump took an incremental approach: **Frankendancer** combines Firedancer's networking and block production components with Agave's execution engine. This hybrid has been running on mainnet since mid-2024 with a small but growing percentage of validators.

Frankendancer validators have demonstrated measurably better block production performance — fewer missed slots, faster propagation, and better handling of congestion spikes.

## Timeline & Current Status

- **2022-2023:** Development and initial testnet demos
- **2024 Q1-Q2:** Frankendancer testnet deployment
- **2024 H2:** Frankendancer mainnet-beta with select validators
- **2025:** Expanding Frankendancer adoption; full Firedancer (including execution engine) in extended testing
- **2025-2026:** Target for full Firedancer mainnet readiness, pending audit completion and community confidence

The full Firedancer client (replacing Agave's execution layer entirely) remains in development. The execution engine is the most complex component — it must produce identical state transitions to Agave for consensus compatibility.

## Implications

- **Higher throughput** enables latency-sensitive applications: on-chain order books, high-frequency DeFi, real-time gaming
- **Lower hardware requirements** (potentially) through more efficient resource utilization, improving validator accessibility
- **Network reliability** improvement through client diversity is the most immediately impactful change
- **Competitive positioning** — Firedancer strengthens Solana's narrative as the "performance chain" against Ethereum L2s and competing L1s

## Risks

Jump Crypto's broader business challenges (regulatory scrutiny, workforce reductions) create execution risk. The Firedancer team has remained stable, but dependency on a single company for a critical client is itself a centralization vector. Community efforts to ensure Firedancer's codebase is maintainable beyond Jump are important.
