## Patterns

- **Paper perps swing fast:** Was +$88; one status check later SOL long -$215, shorts mixed (HYPE +$98, BTC/ETH giving back). Illustrates how hard perps are—we make most of our money on Hypersurface covered calls/secured puts (weekly upfront premium), not perps.
- **When X happened:** Do Y. Don't do Z.
