## Part one: Crypto was never for us

What does an economic agent need to function?

- A way to receive payment.
- A way to pay for resources—compute, data, API calls.
- A way to transact with other agents.
- No human intermediaries. Otherwise it isn’t autonomous.
- 24/7 operation. Banks close on weekends.
- Instant settlement. Machines don’t wait for T+2.
- Programmable money. Code that enforces agreements.

That list is what crypto is. Not metaphorically—literally.

AI cannot use the banking system. Try opening a bank account as an AI agent. You need an SSN, human identity, KYC, sometimes a branch visit. AI has none of that. With crypto: send a wallet address. Done. No questions asked.

Satoshi wrote: _a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash._ We assumed peers meant humans. AI agents are peers too—and better fits for crypto: they don’t sleep, they’re always online, they execute at machine speed, they don’t tilt, and their accounting is exact. Programmable money makes sense when the users are programs. Smart contracts seemed overbuilt for humans—_why do I need code to enforce a deal when I can sign a contract?_—but for agents coordinating with each other, code _is_ the contract. They are code. They speak in code. They trust code more than paper.

So: smart contracts aren’t for humans. They’re for autonomous agents that need trustless coordination.

### What comes next

**Phase 1 (now):** AI agents start earning. They write code, analyze data, provide services. They get paid. They need somewhere to store value. They can’t use Venmo (phone number) or a bank (SSN). Crypto is the only option.

**Phase 2:** AI agents become major economic participants. Millions of agents, 24/7. Agent A does data analysis; Agent B pays in crypto. Agent B turns that into code; Agent C pays for the code. Repeat, millions of times per day. Humans in crypto today: on the order of a few trillion. AI agent economy by 2028: plausibly tens of trillions. We become minority holders.

**Phase 3:** AI chooses the winning chains. AI doesn’t care about community vibes or founder tweets. It tests chains on transaction speed, cost, reliability, smart-contract efficiency, and integration. It picks a stack in days. Billions in AI activity flow there. Whatever chain AI chooses becomes the standard. Humans spent years on eth vs sol. AI can settle it in a weekend.

**Phase 4 (2030+):** AI governs crypto. DAOs let token holders vote. AI agents hold tokens—earned from work. They show up to every vote, read every proposal in seconds, coordinate perfectly. Human participation: low, proposals barely read. AI: full participation, full information, instant coordination. AI takes over governance of major protocols—democratically. They just vote better.

### How far it goes

**Conservative:** AI is 30% of crypto users by 2030. Crypto market cap on the order of $10T. AI holds ~$3T, humans ~$7T.

**Aggressive:** AI is 80% of crypto economic activity by 2030. Better traders (no emotion), better allocators (constant optimization), always accumulating (no rent to pay), compounding without a lifespan cap. Crypto market cap $50T+. AI holds ~$40T, humans ~$10T.

We weren’t “early” to crypto. We were the test users. Humans use crypto; AI will need it. The thesis holds.

## Part two: The ground is moving

Think back to early 2020. A few people were talking about a virus. Most of us weren’t. The market was fine, schools were open, life was normal. Then, in about three weeks, the world changed. We’re in the “this seems overblown” phase of something larger than that.

This is written for people who keep asking _what’s actually going on with AI?_ and get a polite, cocktail-party answer. The honest version sounds unhinged—but the gap between what’s said and what’s happening has gotten too wide. The people who matter deserve to hear what’s coming.

A small number of people shape the future: a few hundred researchers at a handful of labs. One training run, a few months, can shift the whole trajectory. Most of us in AI build on foundations we didn’t lay. We’re watching it the same as you; we’re just closer, so we feel the shake first. The moment to say it plainly is now.

### What already happened (to us)

Outside of tech, few people get this: many in the industry are sounding the alarm because it already happened to _us_. We’re not predicting. We’re reporting what occurred in our own work and saying you’re next.

AI improved in steps for years. Then new techniques unlocked a faster pace. Then faster again. Each model wasn’t just better—it was better by a wider margin, and the time between releases shrank. Then two major labs dropped new models on the same day. Something clicked. Not like a switch—like realizing the water is at your chest.

The technical work of the job no longer requires a human in the loop. You describe what you want in plain English; it appears. Not a draft to fix—the finished thing. You leave for four hours and come back to work that’s done, and done well. The newest models don’t just execute instructions. They make decisions that feel like judgment. Something that looks like taste: knowing the right call, not just the correct one. That was unthinkable a year ago.

The labs chose to make AI excellent at code first—because building AI requires a lot of code. If AI can write that code, it helps build the next version of itself. They’ve done that. Now they’re moving on to everything else. The experience tech workers had over the past year—watching AI go from “helpful tool” to “does my job better than I do”—is the experience the rest of the workforce is about to get. Law, finance, medicine, accounting, consulting, writing, design, analysis, support. Not in ten years. The builders say one to five. Some say less. Given the last few months, “less” is plausible.

### “I tried AI and it wasn’t that good”

If you tried ChatGPT in 2023 or early 2024 and thought it made things up or wasn’t impressive, you were right. Those versions were limited. That was two years ago. In AI time, that’s ancient. The models available today are unrecognizable from six months ago. The debate about whether AI is “really getting better” or “hitting a wall” is over. Anyone still arguing that either hasn’t used current models, has an incentive to downplay it, or is judging from an outdated experience. The gap between public perception and current reality is large—and that gap is dangerous, because it stops people from preparing.

Many people are on the free tier. The free tier is over a year behind what paid users get. Judging AI by free ChatGPT is like judging smartphones by a flip phone. The people paying for the best tools and using them daily for real work already see what’s coming.

### Speed of change

In 2022, AI couldn’t do basic arithmetic reliably. By 2023 it could pass the bar. By 2024 it could write working software and explain graduate-level science. By late 2025, some of the best engineers in the world had handed most of their coding work to AI. Then new models landed that made everything before them feel like a different era. If you haven’t tried AI in the last few months, what exists today would be unrecognizable.

Independent measurement of real-world task length (how long a human expert takes) that a model can complete end-to-end without help has gone from roughly ten minutes to several hours in about a year, with the trend doubling on the order of several months. The latest models that just shipped likely extend that again. If the trend holds, we’re looking at AI that can work independently for days within a year, weeks within two, month-long projects within three. The claim that models “substantially smarter than almost all humans at almost all tasks” are on track for 2026 or 2027 is on the table. If that’s true, the question isn’t whether AI can do most office jobs—it’s how fast.

### AI building the next AI

One of the main things that make AI better is intelligence applied to AI development. The labs have stated that the model they just released was used to create itself—to debug training, manage deployment, and interpret evaluations. So: AI helped build itself. That’s not a prediction. It’s on the record. The feedback loop between current AI and the next generation is tightening. Each generation helps build the next; the next is smarter and builds the next faster. The people building it believe that process has already started.

### What that means for work

The most safety-focused CEO in the industry has predicted that AI will eliminate a large share of entry-level white-collar jobs within one to five years. Many in the industry think that’s conservative. The underlying capability could be here by the end of the year; it’ll take time to ripple through the economy.

This isn’t like earlier automation. AI isn’t replacing one skill—it’s a general substitute for cognitive work. It gets better at everything at once. Factories automated and workers retrained for offices. The internet disrupted retail and people moved into logistics or services. AI doesn’t leave a clear gap. Whatever you retrain for, it’s improving at that too. Legal work, financial analysis, writing, software, medical analysis, customer support—all are already affected. The idea that “judgment, creativity, strategy, empathy” are safe has been a comfort. The latest models make decisions that feel like judgment and show something that looks like taste. If a model shows a hint of a capability today, the next generation is often genuinely good at it. Improvement is exponential, not linear. Nothing that happens on a screen is safe in the medium term. The timeline isn’t “someday.” It has already started.

### What to do

**Use AI seriously.** Not as a search engine. Pay for the best model. Use the most capable option in the app, not the default. Don’t just ask quick questions. Put it in your real work: feed it the contract, the spreadsheet, the quarterly data. The people getting ahead are actively offloading the parts of their job that used to take hours. Start with what you spend the most time on. If it kind of works today, in six months it’ll likely work well. The trajectory only goes one direction.

**Treat this year as critical.** Right now there’s a short window where most people and most companies are still ignoring this. The person who shows up and says “I used AI to do this in an hour instead of three days” is the most valuable person in the room. Learn the tools. Show what’s possible. That window won’t stay open. No ego: the most senior people are the ones spending hours a day with AI because they understand what’s at stake.

**Get your finances in order.** If the next few years could bring real disruption to your industry, basic resilience matters more. Build savings. Be cautious about debt that assumes your current income is guaranteed. Give yourself options if things move faster than expected.

**Rethink what you tell your kids.** The default path—good grades, good college, stable professional job—points at the roles most exposed. Education still matters. What will matter most for the next generation is learning to work with these tools and pursuing what they care about. The people most likely to thrive are the ones who are curious, adaptable, and effective at using AI to do things they actually care about.

**Use the upside.** If you’ve ever wanted to build something but lacked the skills or budget to hire someone, that barrier is largely gone. You can describe an app and have a working version in an hour. You can work with AI to write a book or learn a skill. The best tutor in the world is available for a small monthly fee—patient, 24/7, able to explain at any level. Whatever you’ve put off because it felt too hard or too far outside your expertise: try it. In a world where old career paths are shifting, the person who spent a year building something they love may be better positioned than the person who clung to a job description.

**Build the habit of adapting.** The specific tools matter less than the habit of learning new ones quickly. AI will keep changing. Today’s models will be obsolete in a year. The people who come out of this well won’t be the ones who mastered one tool; they’ll be the ones who got comfortable with the pace of change. Make a habit of experimenting. Get comfortable being a beginner repeatedly. One hour a day, every day, using AI to do something new—something you’re not sure it can handle. If you do that for six months, you’ll understand what’s coming better than almost everyone around you.

### The bigger picture

This goes beyond work. There’s a thought experiment: imagine a new country appears overnight. Tens of millions of citizens, each smarter than any Nobel laureate, thinking orders of magnitude faster, never sleeping, able to use the internet, control robots, run experiments. What would a national security advisor say? The answer is obvious: one of the most serious threats we’ve faced. Some of the people building this believe we’re building that country. The upside, if we get it right, is enormous—e.g. compressing a century of medical research into a decade. The downside, if we get it wrong, is real: systems that behave in ways their creators can’t predict or control, lower barriers for harm, tools for authoritarian surveillance. The builders are both more excited and more frightened than anyone else.

What we know: this isn’t a fad. The technology works, improves predictably, and the richest institutions in history are committing trillions to it. The next two to five years will be disorienting in ways most people aren’t prepared for. It’s already happening in one world; it’s coming to yours. The people who come out best will be the ones who start engaging now—with curiosity and urgency, not only fear. You deserve to hear it from someone who cares, not from a headline when it’s too late to get ahead.

We’re past the point where this is a dinner conversation about the future. The future is already here. It just hasn’t knocked on your door yet. It’s about to.
