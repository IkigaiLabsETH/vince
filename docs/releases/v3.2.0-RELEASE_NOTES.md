**Release date:** 2026-02-18

---

## Perps paper trading bot

- **Paper trading service** and risk manager updates; protection layers documented in `plugin-vince/PROTECTION_LAYERS.md`.
- **paperOps tasks** for scheduled paper operations; dynamic config and paper trading defaults.
- **Context feature stats** utility for paper-bot feature handling.
- **PRD:** `docs/PRD_LIVE_HYPERLIQUID_PERPS.md`; **runtime contract:** `docs/TRADING_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md`.
- Integration and xResearch service tests updated.

## Polymarket trading desk

- **New plugin:** `plugin-polymarket-desk` — signals, sized orders, trade log schema (Drizzle); Synth client for forecast API.
- **Analyst (Oracle):** POLYMARKET_EDGE_CHECK — compare Synth forecast vs Polymarket price; emit signal when edge above threshold; Oracle loads desk plugin.
- **Risk agent:** Polymarket Risk — POLYMARKET_RISK_APPROVE (Kelly sizing, write sized orders); new agent `polymarketRisk.ts`.
- **Performance agent:** Polymarket Performance — POLYMARKET_DESK_REPORT (TCA, fill rate, summary); new agent `polymarketPerformance.ts`.
- **Executor (Otaku):** POLYMARKET_EXECUTE_PENDING_ORDER action; 2-minute poll task to consume pending sized orders and place orders via CLOB.
- **Schedule:** Hourly analyst, 15m risk snapshot, 4h performance report (see `POLYMARKET_TRADING_DESK.md`).
- **Full test suite** for the desk plugin (53 tests): synthClient, edge check, risk approve, desk report, desk schedule, plugin export.

## Synth API and Pro plan

- **Documented in** `docs/POLYMARKET_TRADING_DESK.md` §11.
- Analyst edge check uses Synth’s prediction-percentiles API via `getSynthForecast(asset)`.
- **Free tier:** Volatility Dashboard only, no API — desk would run on mock only.
- **Pro ($199/mo)** required for: Polymarket Predictions + 5,000 API calls/month for live edge checks. Env: `SYNTH_API_KEY`, optional `SYNTH_API_URL`.

## Macs sold out / local inference (LOCALSONLY update)

- **We predicted this:** 48GB+ Mac Minis bought for local AI; most sit idle — that’s a massive inference network on hardware people already own at ~$1/mo electricity.
- **Privacy wall:** Decentralized inference fails because the node operator can read your prompts. Goal: _blind inference_ — machine does the work, returns the result, has zero knowledge of the data.
- **Why crypto fails at full speed:** Additive masking breaks on nonlinear ops (e.g. RMSNorm); per-layer correction = round-trip per layer = too slow. Architectural limit.
- **What works on macOS:** SIP (root can’t read hardened process memory), Secure Enclave (keys never leave chip), Hardened Runtime + Code Signing. Chain closes: operator can’t have both key access and memory read.
- **One missing piece:** App Attest works on iOS to prove key is in a real Secure Enclave; on macOS same SDK returns false. One boolean away from decentralized private inference on consumer hardware.
- **Updated:** `docs/LOCALSONLY.md` and `knowledge/sentinel-docs/LOCALSONLY.md` with the full section.
