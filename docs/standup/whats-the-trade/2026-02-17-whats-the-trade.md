**Tuesday, Feb 17 — What's the Trade**

Tech is bleeding and crypto is holding its ground, which tells you everything about where the real conviction sits right now. NVDA down 2.24%, Apple off 2.27%, but BTC perps at $68k and ETH holding $1973. The rotation out of mega-cap tech into risk assets is real.

The obvious play is long BTC or ETH, but everyone sees that. The better expression is short NVDA here. The AI darling is finally showing cracks after months of relentless buying. At $182.78, it's given up all the post-earnings euphoria and then some. Meanwhile, crypto perps are stable despite the broader tech selloff, suggesting institutional money is rotating rather than fleeing risk entirely.

NVDA has been the poster child for the everything-AI trade, but that narrative is getting stale. Earnings season showed companies are starting to question their AI capex spend. The stock trades at stupid multiples and needs perfect execution to justify current levels. With BTC holding strong above $68k, it's clear where the new money wants to be.

The risk is obvious — if this is just a one-day tech rotation and NVDA bounces back to $190+, you're toast. But the setup favors continuation. When crypto holds while tech dumps, it usually means something bigger is shifting.

NVDA · PUT SPREAD · SHORT
5x Feb28 $180/$175 @ $1.20 · risk $600
$182   lose   above $180
+EV above 60% · dies if BTC <$65k
Alt: BTC-PERP $68k long (safer but lower edge)
