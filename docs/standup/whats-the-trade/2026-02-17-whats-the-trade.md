📊 CT is split between macro caution and AI euphoria today. The Fed narrative has everyone watching for hawkish signals, but underneath that, defense spending chatter is building momentum around Palantir. PLTR jumped 6% yesterday and the sentiment is sticky — government contracts, AI defense applications, and that classic "picks and shovels" play during geopolitical uncertainty.

Here's the thing: everyone's watching NVDA at $185 (up 1.2% today), but Palantir at $133 is the cleaner expression. NVDA carries all the AI hype baggage and semiconductor cycle risk. PLTR gets you pure-play exposure to the defense AI theme without the Taiwan risk or chip inventory concerns that plague the obvious names.

The government spending angle is real. Defense budgets don't get cut when tensions are high, and PLTR's government revenue is stickier than consumer AI spending. Plus, at $133, you're not paying the full premium that NVDA commands at $185.

Risk is straightforward: if the Fed comes out more dovish than expected, growth names get hit as rate cut expectations shift. Also, any PLTR-specific contract delays or earnings disappointment kills the momentum trade fast. The stock moves 10-15% on earnings, so timing matters.

But the setup is there. Defense spending narrative + AI applications + government customer stickiness. Better risk-adjusted than chasing NVDA into resistance.

PLTR · perp · LONG
100 shares @ $133.02 · risk $665
$133 lose if <$126 gain if >$140
+EV above 5% · dies if Fed dovish pivot
Alt: NVDA $185 long (more obvious, higher beta)
