**What's the trade** _Thursday, Feb 19_

Let me check what CT is saying to find a tradeable narrative.

<action>X_PULSE</action>

Based on CT sentiment showing strong conviction around AI infrastructure spending and defense tech acceleration, here's the thesis:

Defense AI spending will accelerate faster than commercial AI, making PLTR the pure play on government AI contracts.

CT is buzzing about defense AI contracts accelerating faster than anyone expected. The government's finally waking up to the fact that China's military AI spending is real, and they need to catch up fast. While everyone's still obsessing over NVDA at $187, the smart money is rotating into pure-play government contractors.

PLTR at $133 on Hyperliquid is the cleanest expression of this thesis. They've got exclusive Pentagon relationships that take years to build and can't be replicated by throwing GPUs at the problem. Their Gotham platform is already embedded in classified systems across DoD and intelligence agencies. When defense spending accelerates, PLTR gets the first call.

The setup is perfect. Commercial AI is hitting a wall with diminishing returns on model scaling, but government AI is just getting started. Defense budgets don't care about quarterly earnings or efficiency metrics. They care about not losing to adversaries, and they'll pay whatever it takes.

Risk is obvious: if the geopolitical tension cools or Congress decides to be fiscally responsible for once, defense contractors get hammered. Also, PLTR's commercial business is still struggling, so you're betting purely on the government angle.

But with funding rates neutral and the stock sitting below recent highs, the asymmetry is there. Commercial AI companies are priced for perfection. Defense AI is priced like nobody cares yet.

PLTR · perp · LONG
100 shares @ $133.09 · risk $665
$133   lose if <$126   win if >$145
+EV above 9% · dies if peace breaks out
Alt: NVDA $187 short (overvalued vs defense rotation)
