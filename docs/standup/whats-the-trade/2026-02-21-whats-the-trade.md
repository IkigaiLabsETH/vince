**What's the trade** _Saturday, Feb 21_

GOOGL trades at a discount to MAG7 peers despite superior search moat and AI integration progress that the market is undervaluing relative to capex concerns.

---

Google's getting hammered on AI capex fears while quietly building the most defensible position in search + AI integration. The market's pricing GOOGL like it's bleeding market share when search revenue keeps growing and Gemini is actually gaining ground against ChatGPT in enterprise deals.

Look at today's moves: GOOGL up 4% on Robinhood while META only managed 1.7% and MSFT went negative. That's unusual strength for a stock the Street keeps calling "behind on AI." The Hyperliquid GOOGL perp at $315.57 is tracking tight to spot, giving you clean exposure without the options premium decay that's killing most tech plays right now.

The asymmetry here is simple: Google's search moat generates $200B+ annually with 40%+ margins, funding whatever AI experiments they want. Meanwhile the market's pricing them like they're Yahoo in 2010. Every other MAG7 name trades at 25-30x forward earnings while GOOGL sits at 22x despite having the cleanest balance sheet and highest free cash flow yield.

The expression that beats buying GOOGL stock outright? Go long the GOOGL perp and short MAG7 index exposure. But if you're picking one trade, straight long GOOGL perp captures the reversion without the complexity.

Risk is simple: if search traffic actually starts declining month-over-month, this thesis dies. But we're not seeing that in the data yet.
