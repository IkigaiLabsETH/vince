**X PULSE REPORT**
*Generated: Friday, Feb 20*

CT is split between euphoria and exhaustion. BTC sitting at $68k has the maximalists calling for $100k while ETH at $1968 feels forgotten. The real story is in the stocks though — NVDA barely moved at $187.9 while Tesla gained to $411.71. But here's what everyone's missing: Palantir at $135.82 is trading like it's just another AI stock when it's becoming the backbone of government AI deployment.

The asymmetry is clear. While CT obsesses over crypto pumps and NVDA's next earnings beat, PLTR is quietly positioning itself as the picks-and-shovels play for the AI arms race. Government contracts don't get priced out during market corrections. They compound. And at current levels, you're getting enterprise AI exposure without paying the NVDA premium that has retail frothing.

The Hyperliquid perp gives you clean exposure without the stock market's weekend gaps or after-hours shenanigans. Better than buying COIN or MSTR as crypto proxies — those are correlation trades that break when you need them most. PLTR moves on its own fundamentals.

Risk is real though. If the broader AI narrative cracks or government spending gets questioned, this goes down hard. Watch for any signs that federal AI budgets are getting cut or delayed.

PLTR-PERP · perp · LONG
100 shares @ $135.82 · risk $500
$135.82   lose if <$130   win if >$145
+EV above 7% · dies if gov AI spending cuts
Alt: NVDA $188.86 long (safer but crowded)
