**What's the trade** _Wednesday, Feb 18_

Let me check what CT is saying to find a tradeable narrative.

CT is pricing that Trump's crypto-friendly cabinet picks and potential strategic Bitcoin reserve will drive institutional FOMO before any actual policy implementation, making BTC outperform traditional safe havens like GOLD in the near term.

CT is buzzing about Trump's crypto cabinet picks and the potential for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, but here's the thing — everyone's already positioned for BTC to moon. The real alpha is in MSTR, which gives you leveraged Bitcoin exposure with actual operational upside that most traders are sleeping on.

MicroStrategy at $129.59 on Hyperliquid is trading like a Bitcoin proxy, but it's actually a software company that's been aggressively accumulating BTC since 2020. When institutional FOMO hits Bitcoin, MSTR doesn't just follow — it amplifies. The company's treasury strategy means every $1,000 BTC move translates to roughly 2-3x that impact on the stock price.

What makes this better than straight BTC? Saylor's been hinting at more aggressive accumulation strategies, and if Trump actually announces reserve plans, MSTR becomes the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Plus, you're getting software revenue as a floor while riding the crypto wave as a ceiling.

The risk is obvious: if Bitcoin stalls or regulatory uncertainty creeps back in, MSTR gets hit twice — once as a crypto play, once as a leveraged bet. But with BTC holding $68,100 and the political winds shifting, that downside feels manageable for the potential 3x upside move.

MSTR-PERP · perp · LONG
100 shares @ $129.59 · risk $500
$129   lose if BTC <$65k   gain if reserve news
+EV above 15% · dies if crypto regulation FUD
Alt: BTC-PERP $68100 long (safer but lower beta)
