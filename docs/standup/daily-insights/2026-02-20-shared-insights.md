## Solus
**Today:** Friday, 2026-02-20. Hypersurface weekly options settle Friday 08:00 UTC. TODAY IS SETTLEMENT DAY — old positions expire today. Focus on the NEW week's strike.

**Live spot (use these — do not guess):** [Hypersurface spot USD] BTC $67,774, ETH $1,973.39, SOL $84.44, HYPE $29.97

**Last week's strategy:** # Weekly options context (Solus)

Solus reads portfolio and open-option context from a single markdown file so he can advise in "covered call mode" and answer daily hold/close/adjust questions in standup.

## File location

- **Path:** `docs/standup/weekly-options-context.md` (or under `STANDUP_DELIVERABLES_DIR` if set).
- **Env override:** `SOLUS_PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT` — when set, this string is used as the full portfolio + open-positions block for every Solus reply (file is still used for "Last week's strategy" in standup unless `SOLUS_LAST_WEEK_STRATEGY` is set).

## File format

Use markdown headings. Order does not matter. Optional sections:

### `## Portfolio`

Holdings, co…

**Status:** Under construction -- no wallet execution yet.

**Steps to get operational:**
1. Configure Bankr wallet (Base + Solana) -- set EVM_PRIVATE_KEY and SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY in .env
2. Test with plugin-evm / plugin-solana: simple token balance check
3. Once balance check works, enable DefiLlama yield scanning (already loaded)

**Today's task:** Complete step 1 -- generate or import wallet keys and verify Bankr connection. Report: wallet address, chain, balance.

## Clawterm
**Daily Standup — OpenClaw**

No X activity in the last 24h, but web shows strong setup momentum: Reddit users asking about safe local installs (Surface Pro, wiping strategy) and malicious skill detection; guides circulating on the 25 Tools + 53 official Skills, plus free API token setup. The friction point is clear—builders want to know which skills are safe and how to run OpenClaw without token bleed.

**Concrete focus for the team:** Ship a verified Skills registry (green-check official skills only, flag community skills by trust score) and pin it in the setup docs. Solves the "which skills are safe?" question that's blocking adoption right now.
