```

### `## Last week's strategy` (optional)

If you use this heading, only its body is used as "Last week's strategy" in standup. Otherwise, everything in the file that is not under `## Portfolio` or `## Open positions` is used as last week's strategy (so you can put a freeform paragraph or multiple sections).

**Last week's strategy:** # Weekly options context (Solus)

Solus reads portfolio and open-option context from a single markdown file so he can advise in "covered call mode" and answer daily hold/close/adjust questions in standup.

## File location

## Clawterm
**Daily Standup Summary**

No X chatter on OpenClaw in the last 24h. Web shows strong focus on enterprise hardening: a detailed guide on architecture, setup, skills security, and an enterprise checklist for 2026 is circulating. The core message is clear—OpenClaw is an always-on autonomous agent across messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord), and the real risk isn't "AI went rogue" but sloppy permissions and supply chain (unsafe skill installs, exposed Gateway ports, plaintext credentials). ClawHub marketplace and onboarding wizard are the entry points.

**Concrete Tech Focus:** Ship a **SkillGuard audit CLI** (`openclaw skills audit --deep --marketplace`) that scans installed skills for permission creep, plaintext secrets, and supply-chain red flags before they run. Builders need one-command confidence on skill safety—make it the default security gate before any skill hits production.
