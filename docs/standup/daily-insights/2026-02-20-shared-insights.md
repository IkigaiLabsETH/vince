## Solus

**Today:** Friday, 2026-02-20. Hypersurface weekly options settle Friday 08:00 UTC. TODAY IS SETTLEMENT DAY — old positions expire today. Focus on the NEW week's strike.

**Live spot (use these — do not guess):** [Hypersurface spot USD] BTC $67,690, ETH $1,969.23, SOL $84.43, HYPE $30.08

**Last week's strategy:** # Weekly options context (Solus)

Solus reads portfolio and open-option context from a single markdown file so he can advise in "covered call mode" and answer daily hold/close/adjust questions in standup.

## File location

- **Path:** `docs/standup/weekly-options-context.md` (or under `STANDUP_DELIVERABLES_DIR` if set).
- **Env override:** `SOLUS_PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT` — when set, this string is used as the full portfolio + open-positions block for every Solus reply (file is still used for "Last week's strategy" in standup unless `SOLUS_LAST_WEEK_STRATEGY` is set).

## File format

Use markdown headings. Order does not matter. Optional sections:

### `## Portfolio`

Holdings, co…

**Status:** Under construction -- no wallet execution yet.

**Steps to get operational:**

1. Configure Bankr wallet (Base + Solana) -- set EVM_PRIVATE_KEY and SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY in .env
2. Test with plugin-evm / plugin-solana: simple token balance check
3. Once balance check works, enable DefiLlama yield scanning (already loaded)

**Today's task:** Complete step 1 -- generate or import wallet keys and verify Bankr connection. Report: wallet address, chain, balance.

## Clawterm

**Daily Standup — OpenClaw**

Tech With Tim's full course (VPS setup → skills → memory → voice/Telegram) is the dominant builder signal—1.95M subs, 855 views, comprehensive coverage of Docker, gateway, IDENTITY/SOUL/HEARTBEAT markdown, and coding skills. No X chatter in the last 24h, but web momentum is clear: setup-to-production workflows (VPS + Hostinger, Docker sandboxing, cost optimization) and skill enablement (Telegram, speech-to-text, cronjobs) are what builders are shipping. The narrative has shifted from passive chatbots to proactive autonomous agents; OpenClaw is positioned as the viral open-source leader.

**Concrete tech focus:** Ship a **one-click Hostinger + Docker + OpenClaw installer script** (or Ansible playbook) that bundles VPS provisioning, Docker setup, gateway binding, and Telegram config. Tim's course proves demand; reduce friction from 20 minutes to 5 and capture that momentum. Alternatively, publish a **"Skills Marketplace"** (YAML templates for Telegram, speech-to-text, coding, cronjobs) so builders fork and customize faster.
