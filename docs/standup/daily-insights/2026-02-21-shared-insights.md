## Solus
**Today:** Saturday, 2026-02-21. Hypersurface weekly options settle Friday 08:00 UTC.

**Live spot (use these — do not guess):** [Hypersurface spot USD] BTC $68,025, ETH $1,968.34, SOL $84.66, HYPE $30.30

**Last week's strategy:** # Weekly options context (Solus)

Solus reads portfolio and open-option context from a single markdown file so he can advise in "covered call mode" and answer daily hold/close/adjust questions in standup.

## File location

- **Path:** `docs/standup/weekly-options-context.md` (or under `STANDUP_DELIVERABLES_DIR` if set).
- **Env override:** `SOLUS_PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT` — when set, this string is used as the full portfolio + open-positions block for every Solus reply (file is still used for "Last week's strategy" in standup unless `SOLUS_LAST_WEEK_STRATEGY` is set).

## File format

Use markdown headings. Order does not matter. Optional sections:

### `## Portfolio`

Holdings, cost basis, and mode. Injected into every Solus reply and into standup.

Example:

**Status:** Under construction -- no wallet execution yet.

**Steps to get operational:**
1. Configure Bankr wallet (Base + Solana) -- set EVM_PRIVATE_KEY and SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY in .env
2. Test with plugin-evm / plugin-solana: simple token balance check
3. Once balance check works, enable DefiLlama yield scanning (already loaded)

**Today's task:** Complete step 1 -- generate or import wallet keys and verify Bankr connection. Report: wallet address, chain, balance.

## Clawterm
**Daily Standup — OpenClaw**

Tech With Tim's full course (VPS setup → skills → memory → voice → Telegram) is the trending educational resource—1.95M subscribers, 855 views, concrete timestamps covering Docker, gateway access, coding skills, IDENTITY/SOUL/HEARTBEAT markdown, and cronjobs. No X activity in the last 24h, but the web signal is strong: setup-to-production workflows and skill enablement are what builders are shipping. freeCodeCamp also published a 1-hour comprehensive intro (Docker sandboxing, persistent memory, WhatsApp/Discord integration), positioning OpenClaw as the viral open-source agent framework for 2026.

**Concrete next focus:** Ship a **"Coding Skills Quick Start"** guide (5-min setup) that walks builders through enabling and testing the coding skill module—Tim's timestamps show 31:45–34:20 is a friction point, and that's where we can drop a one-pager with example YAML + test case.
