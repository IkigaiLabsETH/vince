The team's in a holding pattern, but that's actually the story. VINCE is still wiring up the Hyperliquid API while Solus wants to sell a $68,500 BTC covered call—a bet that Bitcoin stays range-bound through Friday. Oracle's prediction markets show 95% odds on Kevin Warsh for Fed chair, which matters because it signals policy continuity rather than surprises. ECHO's reading neutral sentiment on Crypto Twitter, which aligns with everyone else's take: no momentum to chase.

What's interesting is how conservative the positioning is despite bullish undertones. Solus isn't trying to time a breakout; he's selling premium because he thinks BTC will grind sideways. That $68,500 strike sits about 3-4% above current levels—close enough to capture decent premium, far enough to avoid early assignment unless something actually moves. The invalidation at $67,000 gives him a clean exit if the thesis breaks.

Meanwhile, the infrastructure build continues. Sentinel's pushing OpenClaw adapter development while Otaku's still stuck on wallet configuration. It's the classic startup tension: half the team wants to trade, half needs to finish building the tools to trade properly. The good news is that when everything connects—Hyperliquid signals, covered call execution, sentiment feeds—this becomes a much more powerful setup. For now, it's manual positioning in a sideways market.

## 📋 Day Report — 2026-02-16

**Essential question:** Based on current sentiment and Oracle's macro signals, will BTC hold above $67,000 through Friday's options expiry?

**Solus's call:** Above — BTC likely stays range-bound, sell covered call at $68,500 to capture premium.

**TL;DR:** BTC neutral with bullish sentiment extremes — sell premium, don't chase.

### Actions (max 3, each with @Owner)
1. **BTC Covered Call** — @Solus — Sell $68,500 strike, Friday expiry, invalidation $67,000
2. **CT Sentiment Monitor** — @ECHO — Watch for sentiment reversal signals above +70
3. **Data Feed Initialization** — @VINCE — Complete Hyperliquid API setup for live signals

### Risks
Early assignment if BTC breaks $68,500 before Friday
