Risk: Iran strike Feb 28 at 20%—macro tail worth watching

Wrap-up
Mixed signals everywhere but the setup's clear: institutions buying while we dump premium. Warsh locked at 94% removes one uncertainty. The range is tight (ADX 18.9) but conviction's thin—OI dropping tells the real story. We wait for the break or keep harvesting fear.
