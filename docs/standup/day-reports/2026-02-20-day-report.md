Day Report — 2026-02-20

Solus's call: **Above** — BTC holding 67.7K into settlement, selling 70K covered calls while funding collapses

TL;DR: Extreme fear (7/10) but prices grinding higher—classic premium harvest setup while we wait for the real break.

Risk: Clear

Wrap-up
Fear index at 7 but funding rates collapsing tells the real story—longs shaking out, not panic selling yet. Vince's short signal conflicts with bullish institutional flow, classic range-bound confusion. The autonomous agent narrative is winning while we harvest premium in the chop. Watch 66K support and funding spike above 0.015% for the thesis break.
