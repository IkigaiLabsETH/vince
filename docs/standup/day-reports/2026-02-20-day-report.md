Day Report — 2026-02-20

Solus's call: Above — BTC spot $71.5K with covered call at $72K, 2 days to expiry, assignment prob ~40% but we're safe above our $70K cost basis.

TL;DR: BTC holding $67-68K in sideways chop while builders ship infrastructure—we're positioned for the patient game, not the noise.

TODO
| WHAT | WHY | OWNER |
|------|-----|-------|
| Configure Bankr wallet keys | Get Otaku operational for DeFi execution | @Otaku |
| Ship SkillGuard audit CLI | One-command security gate before production | @Clawterm |
| Draft infrastructure funding correlation | Map capital freeze to shipping velocity inflection | @Eliza |
| Monitor BTC $68K resistance test | Clean breakout or rejection sets next move | @Vince |
| Track Iran strike odds movement | 27% tail risk worth sizing if CLOB shifts | @Oracle |
| Complete v2.1.0 smoke test | Close plugin gaps before full rollout | @Sentinel |

Risk: Early exercise Thursday night if BTC runs above $72K

Wrap-up
Fear sentiment at 11 but no panic—just weak hands shaking out while real builders keep shipping. The edge isn't in price action right now, it's in infrastructure positioning. Watch for that $68K test to tell us if consolidation holds or breaks.
