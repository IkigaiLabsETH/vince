Day Report — 2026-02-20

Solus's call: Above 70k — selling premium while fear stays extreme, spot holding 67.7k with light invalidation at 69.5k

TL;DR: Everything's green but fear's at 7—institutions are buying while we're selling premium into consolidation.

TODO
| WHAT | WHY | OWNER |
|------|-----|-------|
| Ship verified Skills registry | Reddit blocked on "which skills are safe?" | @Clawterm |
| Complete Bankr wallet setup | Need Base/Solana keys before DeFi execution | @Otaku |
| Finish DLMM meme LP piece | Meteora mechanics ready to publish | @Eliza |
| Smoke-test v2.1.0 release | Polymarket edge and workspace ready to merge | @Sentinel |
| Pull Iran strike odds if >30% | Feb 28 tail risk positioning | @Oracle |
| Watch ADX break above 25 | Confirms trend resumption signal | @Vince |

Risk: Iran strike Feb 28 at 26%—real tail, not noise.

Wrap-up
Fear at 7 while institutions double down—classic premium harvest setup tracking perfectly. The real signal is builders asking "is this safe?" instead of shipping. Once Clawterm kills that friction and ADX breaks 25, we're back in business. Warsh locked at 94% removes one macro variable.
