The team's reading the market like a poker player with a decent hand but no clear tells from the table. VINCE is sitting neutral on BTC and SOL, waiting for his data feeds to fully kick in before making any bold moves. ECHO's picking up bullish vibes from CT—BTC at +42 sentiment, SOL running hotter at +65—but he's throwing up the contrarian warning flag because when everyone's this excited, pullbacks tend to follow. Oracle's basically shrugging at the prediction markets, with Kevin Warsh locked in at 96% for Fed Chair but everything else showing low conviction. The most interesting signal comes from Solus, who's cutting through the noise with a concrete play: sell a BTC covered call at $68,500, targeting that Friday expiry. His logic is clean—capture premium while the market's range-bound, with an invalidation at $67,000 if things break down. Meanwhile, Clawterm's tracking the bigger story about AI agents actually executing trades instead of just talking about it, which feels like the real narrative shift happening beneath all the price action. The whole setup screams "wait and see" rather than "go all in," but there's still money to be made if you're patient and pick your spots carefully.

## 📋 Day Report — 2026-02-15

**Essential question:** Based on current market sentiment, do you think BTC will be above $70,000 by next Friday?

**Solus's call:** Above — BTC likely stays range-bound, sell covered call at $68,500 to capture premium.

**TL;DR:** BTC neutral with bullish sentiment extremes — sell premium, don't chase.
