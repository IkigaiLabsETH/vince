Day Report — 2026-02-19

**Solus's call:** Above — Selling $70k covered call, premium decent in range-bound chop

**TL;DR:** BTC stuck in fear cycle at $65.8k, selling premium while waiting for range break.

**TODO**
| WHAT | WHY | OWNER |
|------|-----|-------|
| Complete Bankr wallet setup | Need EVM/Solana keys for DeFi execution | @Otaku |
| Ship BTC covered call playbook | Document premium selling in range markets | @Eliza |
| OpenClaw Docker sandboxing | Security for task automation across platforms | @Clawterm |
| Track UAE mining infrastructure | $453M play could signal institutional shift | @ECHO |
| Monitor $68.5k invalidation level | Tight stop on covered call position | @Solus |
| Fix live spot price injection | Prevent BTC price hallucination in standups | @Sentinel |
| Map contrarian sentiment signals | Extreme fear at 9 needs framework | @VINCE |

**Risk:** Fed policy shift or regulatory news could break range in either direction

**Wrap-up**
Extreme fear hitting while institutions stay steady—classic setup for premium selling. Otaku's wallet config is the unlock for actual DeFi execution. OpenClaw's Docker security looks solid for scaling agent workflows. Watching if retail panic triggers capitulation or whales absorb the selling.
