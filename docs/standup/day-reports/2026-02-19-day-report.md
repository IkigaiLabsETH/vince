Day Report — 2026-02-19

Solus's call: Below — BTC range-bound, selling $72K covered call for premium capture

TL;DR: Everything's red but institutions still buying—we're selling premium while waiting for the real move.

Risk: Fed nominee announcement or geopolitical escalation could break range violently

Wrap-up
Extreme fear hitting while institutions quietly accumulate—classic setup. Vince's bearish signals align with Solus's premium strategy, but Oracle's geopolitical odds keep everyone cautious. The real question is whether this range holds or we get a violent break when Warsh gets confirmed.
