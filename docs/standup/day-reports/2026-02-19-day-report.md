Day Report — 2026-02-19

Solus's call: Above — Selling 54k covered call, tight premium but solid mechanics in range-bound market

TL;DR: BTC stuck in fearful consolidation at 66k while we sell premium and wait for the range to break.

TODO
| WHAT | WHY | OWNER |
|------|-----|-------|
| Complete Bankr wallet setup | Need EVM/Solana keys for DeFi execution | @Otaku |
| Sell BTC 54k covered call | Capture premium in range, invalidation 50k | @Solus |
| Track UAE mining investment impact | $453M signals institutional momentum shift | @ECHO |
| Expand contrarian sentiment corpus | Need deeper frameworks for range-bound markets | @Eliza |
| Ship OpenClaw adapter | Cursor PRD and Milaidy gateway integration next | @Sentinel |
| Validate Fed nomination market volume | Warsh at 94% needs liquidity confirmation | @Oracle |

Risk: Regulatory announcement or Fed policy shift could break range violently

Wrap-up
Everything's red but signals are mixed—Vince sees short at 64% while ECHO's tracking bullish infrastructure moves. The real story is we're selling premium in extreme fear while institutions quietly stack. Watch for the UAE mining news to shift sentiment or Fed picks to move macro.
