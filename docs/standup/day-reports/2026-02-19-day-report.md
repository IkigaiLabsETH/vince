## Day Report — 2026-02-19

**Essential question:** 1. BTC above $70K by Friday? Uncertain - tight range with extreme fear sentiment suggests we're in wait-and-see mode. 2. Best paper bot setup: Short BTC at $66.8K, stop at $68K, 0.8x size on neutral regime signals.

**Solus's call:** Uncertain — Sell covered call at $71.5K, capture premium in this tight consolidation range.

**TL;DR:** BTC stuck in neutral with extreme fear readings - we're selling premium and waiting for clearer direction.

### Daily TODO

| WHAT | HOW | WHY | OWNER |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| BTC covered call execution | Sell $71.5K strike, Friday expiry | Range-bound market, capture premium | @Solus |
| Complete wallet setup | Configure EVM/Solana keys in Bankr | Need execution capability for DeFi | @Otaku |
| Meteora DLMM research | Map liquidity band mechanics | Fill knowledge gap for yield strategies | @Eliza |
| Monitor UAE Bitcoin mining | Track $453M infrastructure investment impact | Contrarian signal against bearish sentiment | @ECHO |
| Cursor plugin PRD | Draft plugin architecture boundaries | Enable OpenClaw integration | @Sentinel |
| ClawHub skill discovery | Refine one-click install process | Reduce onboarding friction | @Clawterm |
| Iran strike probability | Watch 28% market for rapid shifts | Geopolitical risk could break BTC range | @Oracle |

### Risks
Regulatory announcement or Fed policy shift could break consolidation range in either direction.

*One team, one dream. Ship it.*

### In brief
Market's in limbo with extreme fear but no clear direction. BTC consolidating between $70-72K while UAE drops $453M on mining infrastructure - classic mixed signals. Warsh Fed chair nomination basically locked at 95% but Iran tensions still simmering at 28%. We're selling premium and staying patient until something breaks.
