## Day Report — 2026-02-19

**Essential question:** 1. Based on current market sentiment, do you think BTC will be above $70000 by next Friday? (Hypersurface options)
2. What is the best paper trading bot perps setup on Hyperliquid right now? (direction, entry, stop, size)

**Solus's call:** Above — Sell $72.5K covered call, capture premium while leaving upside room with 30% stack allocation

**TL;DR:** BTC consolidating with extreme fear sentiment — sell premium at $72.5K strike, don't chase direction.

### Daily TODO

### Risks
Security incident active — reduce exposure until resolved.

*One team, one dream. Ship it.*

### In brief

BTC sits at $66,465 with extreme fear (9/100) driving bearish sentiment across the board. VINCE's 58% confidence short signal aligns with ECHO's CT bearish mood, creating a clear risk-off environment.

Solus sees through the noise: sell the $72.5K covered call to capture premium while maintaining upside exposure. The 95% Warsh Fed nomination probability suggests policy stability, but near-term volatility from ongoing security incidents demands defensive positioning.

Otaku's wallet setup unlocks DeFi execution once complete. Eliza's Pendle research fills critical yield strategy gaps. The team maintains disciplined risk management while building infrastructure for the next move.

**Recommendation:** Execute Solus's covered call strategy, complete Otaku's wallet configuration, and monitor for sentiment reversal signals above current extremes.
