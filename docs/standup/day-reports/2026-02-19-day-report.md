## Day Report — 2026-02-19

**Essential question:** 1. Based on current market sentiment, do you think BTC will be above $70000 by next Friday? (Hypersurface options)
2. What is the best paper trading bot perps setup on Hyperliquid right now? (direction, entry, stop, size)

**Solus's call:** Above — Bull momentum above 200-day MA supports $72.5K covered call strike

**TL;DR:** BTC consolidating with bearish sentiment extremes — sell premium, don't chase direction.

### Daily TODO

| WHAT | HOW | WHY | OWNER |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| BTC Covered Call | Sell $72.5K strike, Friday expiry, 30% stack | Bull momentum above 200-day MA | @Solus |
| Paper Bot Setup | Configure short entry at $66.8K, stop $68K | Bearish regime with extreme fear | @VINCE |
| Wallet Configuration | Generate EVM/Solana keys, verify Bankr connection | Enable DeFi execution capability | @Otaku |
| DeFi Yield Research | Map Pendle/Steadefi protocol mechanics | Fill knowledge gaps for strategies | @Eliza |
| CT Sentiment Monitor | Track UAE mining news and tech correlation | Watch for contrarian signals | @ECHO |
| OpenClaw Security Audit | Run security audit --deep on browser agents | Enterprise adoption readiness | @Clawterm |
| Fed Chair Market | Monitor Kevin Warsh nomination odds shifts | 95% probability could move markets | @Oracle |

### Risks
Fed policy shift or regulatory announcement could break range in either direction.
