# Workspace — Brain output

Brain writes (or you maintain) these files: USER.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md.

- **Templates:** `*.md.template` — minimal stubs; copy and fill, or use Brain to generate.
- **Generated:** After running Brain, generated `*.md` files can live here. Optionally gitignore operator-specific content (see repo root .gitignore).

Sync to `knowledge/teammate/` for VINCE and to `~/.openclaw/workspace/` for OpenClaw CLI. See [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md#sync).
