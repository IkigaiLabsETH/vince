# USER — Operator profile

Identity, background, how they got here. Solo operator, brand, or ecosystem and how the pieces connect.

- **Cognition:** How they think, decide, prioritize; what's broken about their organization.
- **Resources:** Financial reality, energy patterns, when they're sharp, when they crash, constraints.
- **People:** Team, collaborators, clients, dependencies; who drains them, who fuels them.
- **Communication:** Style, channels that overwhelm them, how they want to be talked to.
- **Content and learning:** What they create, consume, and want to learn.
