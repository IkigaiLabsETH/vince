# Otaku-style UI (Vite) integrated and branded as VINCE. Update after feature or fix.

================================================================================
DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

- **This file (progress.txt):** Progress tracker, known issues, key files, session notes.
  Update it when you ship features or hit new issues.

- **Frontend docs index:** src/frontend/docs/README.md
  - Explains what this file contains (this table) and links to progress.txt.
  - Quick start, reference docs table (architecture, development, troubleshooting,
    character-config, plugin-actions, plugin-context-matcher, x402, evm-wallets, research).

- **Repo-level:** README.md (Chat UI troubleshooting), DEPLOY.md (bot reply / local messaging),
  .env.example (MESSAGING), tasks/FRONTEND-ALPHA-QUICKSTART.md (how to run and test UI).

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

- **Stack:** React, Vite, Tailwind v4, @elizaos/api-client (local packages/api-client)
- **Run:** `bun start` → API on :3000, Vite dev server on :5173 (or next free port)
- **Use:** Open the URL the script prints (e.g. http://localhost:5173) for the chat UI.
  Port 3000 serves the default ElizaOS dashboard (invite code); use 5173 for this UI.
- **Build:** `bun run build:frontend` → dist/frontend (served by backend when using start:custom-ui)

- **Otaku reference:** Full canonical Otaku project (structure, plugins, deps, scripts):
  https://github.com/elizaOS/otaku/
  In this repo, OTAKU.md is the single doc for Otaku: plugins table (12 + SQL), dependency
  list from Otaku package.json, project structure (managers/, packages/, plugins/), x402/CDP,
  and troubleshooting. Use OTAKU.md when aligning with Otaku behavior or adding Otaku features.

================================================================================
COMPLETED
================================================================================

## Integration ✅
- Otaku-style frontend brought into repo under src/frontend/
- Vite root: src/frontend; build outDir: ../../dist/frontend
- Proxy: /api and /socket.io → http://localhost:3000 (vite.config.ts)
- Script: scripts/dev-with-vite.js starts backend + Vite, opens browser to correct URL

## Branding ✅
- "Otaku" → "VINCE" in sidebar, mobile header, index.html
- Default sidebar user label "Guest" when not signed in
- Document title "VINCE - Chat" (App.tsx)

## Guest mode & CDP stubs ✅
- Guest mode in App.tsx: when VITE_CDP_PROJECT_ID not set, persistent guest userId + default
  userProfile so UI renders without CDP
- Stubs: src/frontend/stubs/ for @coinbase/cdp-react and @coinbase/cdp-hooks (no-op) so build
  works without installing CDP packages; aliased in vite.config.ts

## Chat UI behavior ✅
- Chat input shown when userId and !isLoadingChannels and (activeChannelId || isNewChatMode);
  no longer requires socket "connected" so input is visible even while connecting
- Fallback copy when chat area not ready: "Click + next to CHAT HISTORY to start a new chat",
  "Loading…", or "Sign in or continue as guest to chat"
- "Connecting…" line shown above chat when socket not yet connected
- Error state: on "API endpoint not found", in-app hint suggests `bun start` and opening the
  printed URL (e.g. http://localhost:5173); Dismiss button to clear

## Dependencies & build ✅
- streamdown ^2.1.0; wrap-ansi-cjs 8.0.0 override for install
- @tailwindcss/vite in vite.config.ts for Tailwind v4
- Removed tw-animate-css import (package not present)
- Local @elizaos/api-client: packages/api-client, built and aliased in vite.config.ts

## Market Pulse (dashboard data + LLM insight) ✅
- Backend: plugin-vince route GET /vince/pulse builds a snapshot from all dashboard services
  (Binance, CoinGlass, CoinGecko, Deribit, HIP-3, News, DexScreener, Meteora, Regime, Aggregator)
  and generates a 2–3 sentence LLM insight via runtime.useModel(TEXT_SMALL). Returns
  { sections, insight, updatedAt }. See src/plugins/plugin-vince/src/routes/dashboardPulse.ts.
- Pulse sections enriched with TLDRs: DexScreener uses getMarketMood() + hot/ape symbols;
  NFT Floors section (nftFloor.getTLDR()); Paper trades section (open positions one-liner from
  positionManager.getOpenPositions()). Same data as terminal, in digestible form.
- Frontend: lib/pulseApi.ts fetches GET /api/agents/:agentId/plugins/vince/pulse; components/chat/
  market-pulse-card.tsx shows the insight at the top of the chat and optional expandable
  sections. Refetches every 2 minutes when tab is visible.
- Quick actions: row of chips below the pulse (ALOHA, News, Memes, Perps, Options) that send
  the trigger message on click (handleQuickPrompt) so the user gets the full narrative reply
  in chat without typing. chat-interface.tsx.
- Chat interface: MarketPulseCard rendered above connection status and messages when agent.id
  is set. If the server does not pass runtime to the plugin route handler, the API returns
  503 and the card is hidden (no crash).

## Docs ✅
- README (repo root) § "Chat UI: API endpoint not found" troubleshooting
- src/frontend/docs/README.md — Frontend docs index and link to this progress file
- src/plugins/plugin-vince/progress.txt: KNOWN ISSUES + session note for this frontend issue
- OTAKU.md: full Otaku reference — canonical link (elizaOS/otaku), project structure with
  managers/ (cdp-transaction-manager.ts), packages/ (api-client, server), all 12 plugins;
  dependency table from Otaku package.json (CDP, x402, ElizaOS, DeFi, UI, etc.); plugins
  section with summary table (biconomy, bootstrap, cdp, clanker, coingecko, defillama,
  etherscan, gamification, morpho, polymarket-discovery, relay, web-search + SQL) and
  subsections for Biconomy, Clanker, Gamification, Morpho, Polymarket discovery

================================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

⚠️ "API endpoint not found"
   Backend returns this when a request to /api/* does not match any route (404 catch-all).
   - Ensure `bun start` is running and open the URL it prints (e.g. http://localhost:5173).
   - If GET /api/server/health is OK but chat still fails, check Network tab for the exact
     failing URL (e.g. /api/messaging/servers, /api/messaging/central-servers/.../channels).
   See repo README Troubleshooting and src/plugins/plugin-vince/progress.txt.

⚠️ Backend guest/anonymous support
   Full chat (create server/channels, send messages) may require backend support for
   unauthenticated or guest users; not yet verified end-to-end.

⚠️ CDP not configured
   When VITE_CDP_PROJECT_ID is not set, CDP wallet and auth use stubs/guest mode. Wallet
   card and sign-in are present but not wired to real CDP.

⚠️ Which agent am I talking to?
   The UI chats with the first agent returned by the API (agentsData[0]). In this repo
   src/index.ts registers: 1) VINCE (vinceAgent), 2) Eliza (elizaAgent). So you are
   talking to VINCE, not Otaku (Otaku is in src/agents/otaku.ts but not in the default
   project agents array). The footer disclaimer now shows the actual agent name (e.g.
   "VINCE is in beta...") so it's clear who you're chatting with.

⚠️ Agent replies not reaching UI (MESSAGE-BUS "fetch failed")
   If "bot status" (or any message) never shows the agent reply and the UI stays on
   "Analyzing your request", check terminal at startup for:
   - [SERVICE:MESSAGE-BUS] Error fetching agent servers (error=fetch failed)
   - [SERVICE:MESSAGE-BUS] Error fetching channels from server (error=fetch failed)
   The message bus can't get server/channel list, so it can't route the reply back.
   Fix: use local-only messaging (recommended for now): in .env set
   ELIZAOS_USE_LOCAL_MESSAGING=true or leave ELIZAOS_API_KEY unset; restart. See DEPLOY.md
   § "Bot status / agent replies not reaching the UI (local)" and .env.example § MESSAGING.

⚠️ Market Pulse card not showing
   The Market Pulse card (LLM insight from dashboard data) fetches GET /api/agents/:agentId/plugins/vince/pulse.
   ElizaOS mounts plugin routes under /api/agents/:id/plugins + route.path — so the path must include
   "plugins" (not /api/agents/:id/vince/pulse). 404 "API endpoint not found" usually means wrong path.
   If the server does not pass the agent runtime to the plugin route handler, the API returns 503
   and the card is not rendered. See plugin-vince routes in index.ts.

================================================================================
IN PROGRESS / BACKLOG
================================================================================

- Verify end-to-end chat: send message → agent reply over Socket.IO + messaging API
   (blocked by MESSAGE-BUS fetch when "fetch failed" at startup)
- Optional: Radix sidebar/sheet for mobile, full action-tool layout from Otaku
- Optional: Replace "Otaku is in beta" disclaimer with VINCE or remove
- Optional: Add Otaku plugins/deps from OTAKU.md if full Otaku behavior (wallet, swaps,
   x402, Morpho, Relay, Polymarket, etc.) is desired; this repo may ship a subset.

SESSION NOTES
================================================================================

2026-02-05:
- progress.txt created for frontend folder; documents integration, branding, guest mode,
  chat input visibility, "API endpoint not found" handling, and known issues.
- Chat UI error: when error message contains "endpoint not found", show hint to use
  `bun start` and open printed URL (chat-interface.tsx).
- README and src/plugins/plugin-vince/progress.txt updated with Chat UI troubleshooting and KNOWN ISSUES.

2026-02-05 (bot status / agent reply delivery):
- chat-interface.tsx: clear typing indicator on any agent message (not only MULTI_STEP_SUMMARY)
  so single-step actions like VINCE_BOT_STATUS stop showing "Analyzing your request" once reply arrives.
- chat-interface.tsx: filter messageBroadcast by channelId/roomId when present so messages for
  other channels aren't shown; added [Chat] debug logs (New message received / Ignoring message for different channel).
- plugin-log-filter: stopped suppressing [SERVICE:MESSAGE-BUS] "Error sending response to central server"
  so that error is visible when reply delivery fails.
- DEPLOY.md: added § "Bot status / agent replies not reaching the UI (local)" explaining
  MESSAGE-BUS "Error fetching agent servers" and "Error fetching channels from server" (fetch failed)
  and that they prevent the bus from routing replies to the UI.
- progress.txt: added KNOWN ISSUES entry for MESSAGE-BUS fetch failed and link to DEPLOY.md.

2026-02-05 (Otaku reference and OTAKU.md):
- OTAKU.md: set as single reference for Otaku; added canonical link to https://github.com/elizaOS/otaku/
- OTAKU.md: project structure now includes managers/ (cdp-transaction-manager.ts), packages/
  (api-client, server), and full plugins/ list (biconomy, bootstrap, cdp, clanker, coingecko,
  defillama, etherscan, gamification, morpho, polymarket-discovery, relay, web-search).
- OTAKU.md: full dependency table from elizaOS/otaku package.json (CDP, x402, ElizaOS plugins,
  DeFi/protocols, UI, data/backend); x402 and plugins paragraphs updated to reference full list.
- OTAKU.md: Plugins section has summary table (all 12 plugins + SQL) and new subsections for
  Biconomy, Clanker, Gamification, Morpho, Polymarket discovery.
- progress.txt: overview mentions Otaku reference (elizaOS/otaku + OTAKU.md); COMPLETED docs
  and KEY FILES updated; BACKLOG note for optional Otaku plugins/deps from OTAKU.md.

2026-02-05 (which agent + why no reply):
- Clarified which agent: first in list from API = VINCE (src/index.ts has vinceAgent, then elizaAgent).
  Otaku exists in src/agents/otaku.ts but is not in the default project; footer was hardcoded "Otaku".
- chat-interface.tsx: footer disclaimer now uses agent.name so it shows the actual agent (e.g. "VINCE is in beta...").
- progress.txt: added KNOWN ISSUES "Which agent am I talking to?" and kept MESSAGE-BUS as cause for no reply.

2026-02-05 (local-only messaging):
- character.ts: load plugin-elizacloud only when ELIZAOS_API_KEY is set AND ELIZAOS_USE_LOCAL_MESSAGING is not 'true'.
  So local-only: set ELIZAOS_USE_LOCAL_MESSAGING=true or leave ELIZAOS_API_KEY unset; restart.
- .env.example: new § MESSAGING (LOCAL-ONLY VS ELIZA CLOUD); ELIZAOS_USE_LOCAL_MESSAGING=true uncommented (default local-only).
- DEPLOY.md: added recommended local-only step (set ELIZAOS_USE_LOCAL_MESSAGING=true or unset ELIZAOS_API_KEY).
- progress.txt: Fix for "no reply" updated to recommend local-only and reference .env.example § MESSAGING.

2026-02-06 (Market Pulse / dashboard data + LLM insight):
- Backend: plugin-vince GET /vince/pulse route (dashboardPulse.ts) aggregates snapshot from
  Binance, CoinGlass, CoinGecko, Deribit, HIP-3, News, DexScreener, Meteora, Regime, Aggregator;
  generates 2–3 sentence LLM insight via useModel(TEXT_SMALL). Route handler expects runtime
  on req.runtime / req.agentRuntime; returns 503 if missing.
- Frontend: pulseApi.ts fetchPulse(agentId); MarketPulseCard shows insight at top of chat,
  optional expandable "N data sections"; refetch every 2 min when tab visible. Rendered in
  chat-interface.tsx above connection status and messages.
- progress.txt: COMPLETED § Market Pulse; KNOWN ISSUES § Market Pulse card not showing; KEY FILES
  updated (market-pulse-card.tsx, pulseApi.ts, docs/README.md, progress.txt).
- Frontend README (docs/README.md): updated with overview, quick start, and link to progress.txt.

2026-02-06 (TLDR data access – pulse enrichment + quick actions):
- Backend (dashboardPulse.ts): DexScreener section now uses getMarketMood() and appends hot/ape
  symbols; added NFT Floors section (nftFloor.getTLDR()); added Paper trades section (open
  positions one-liner from positionManager.getOpenPositions()). Imports VinceNFTFloorService,
  VincePositionManagerService.
- Frontend (chat-interface.tsx): quick-action row below Market Pulse – chips ALOHA, News, Memes,
  Perps, Options that call handleQuickPrompt(message) on click so user gets full narrative in chat.
- progress.txt: Market Pulse § updated with pulse TLDR enrichment and quick actions; docs/README
  updated with quick actions and pulse sections (memes, NFT, paper).
