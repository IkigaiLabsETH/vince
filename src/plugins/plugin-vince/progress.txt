- dynamicConfig.ts - Tunable parameters
- paperTradingDefaults.ts - Bot defaults
- targetAssets.ts - BTC, ETH, SOL, HYPE + 34 HIP-3
- memes.constants.ts - 50+ tracked meme tokens

## Algo ML Improvements ✅
- ALGO_ML_IMPROVEMENTS.md: roadmap for using ML more (position sizing, TP/SL wiring, block low ML quality, improvement report, similarity filter, bandit feedback). Implemented: ML position sizing in paper trading (evaluateAndTrade) – base size multiplied by predictPositionSize (0.5–2x) using signal quality, strength, confidence, volatility regime, drawdown, recent win rate, streak.
- ONNX export: train_models.py uses onnxmltools (not skl2onnx) for XGBoost → ONNX; booster feature names temporarily set to f0, f1, … for converter compatibility. All four models (signal_quality, position_sizing, tp_optimizer, sl_optimizer) export to .onnx when pip3 install onnx onnxmltools. Docs/scripts use pip3 (Mac).

## Fetch Performance (Timeouts + Parallelization) ✅
- Coinglass: 10s timeout on every fetch; refreshData() runs BTC/ETH/SOL + Fear/Greed in parallel; per-asset OI/funding/Binance L/S in parallel; fetchFreeData() runs price/funding/LS/OI in one Promise.all.
- Signal aggregator: SOURCE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS (12s) and withTimeout(ms, label, promise) so one slow source returns null and does not block. Phase 1: Binance, Deribit IV, MarketData, Sanbase, Hyperliquid (options pulse + cross-venue), Deribit comprehensive + DVOL fetched in a single Promise.all; sections 3–10 use pre-fetched results. Phase 2: getTakerVolume, getRSIAdjustment, getOpenWindowInfo wrapped in withTimeout. getAllSignals() uses Promise.all(assets.map(getSignal)) so multi-asset aggregation runs in parallel.

## ML Learning State ✅
- Feature store: 21+ feature/synthetic files in .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/features (features_*.jsonl, synthetic_*.jsonl). 1250+ completed trades for training.
- Synthetic data: generate_synthetic_features.py supports --count, --output, --append (timestamps continue), --win-rate, --seed. train_models.py loads all features_*.jsonl and synthetic_*.jsonl from --data dir.
- ONNX: Script exports .onnx when onnxmltools installed; joblib backups and improvement_report.md always written. Run: python3 …/train_models.py --data .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/features --output .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/models --min-samples 90.
- Tests: test_train_models.py (6 tests) and generate_synthetic_features.py verified; pytest optional.

================================================================================
PRIORITY (real-time data for paper trading algo)
================================================================================

🟢 VINCEBINANCE HTTP 451 – (1) DONE. (2) BACKLOG
   (1) DONE: binance.service.ts has logHttpWarn() with 5-min cooldown per endpoint,
   logs 451 with context "Unavailable For Legal Reasons – check region/restrictions",
   and uses logger.debug for repeats. No more 451 flood on Eliza Cloud Warnings.
   (2) BACKLOG: Consider skipping Binance in signal aggregator when 451 persists
   (e.g. after N consecutive 451s) for graceful degradation.

🟢 IMPROVE LOGS FOR ELIZA CLOUD (https://www.elizacloud.ai/) – PARTIAL ✅
   Align with Eliza Cloud Container Logs / Metrics UX: filterable levels,
   structured context, less noise, high-signal summaries.
   - ✅ Reduce INFO noise: Signal aggregator per-asset "N source(s) → M factors"
     → debug. Coinglass dashboard line → debug. Hyperliquid OPTIONS PULSE
     (non-neutral) → debug; CROSS-VENUE stays INFO only when arb opportunities.
     Paper trading: correlation/DVOL/regime/session/streak/ML sizing → debug.
     Trade open/close, trigger hit, pause/resume, cascade/liquidations stay INFO.
   - Warnings: Prioritize actionable warnings (e.g. VinceBinance 451 above);
     avoid repetitive same-message warnings (use cooldown + debug for repeats).
   - Structure: Include consistent context (source tag, optional agentId/roomId
     when relevant) so Cloud log search/filter stays useful.
   - Optional: Periodically log a single "dashboard-style" summary (e.g. health
     of data sources, signal source counts) instead of many per-call lines.

🔴 IMPROVE THE AMOUNT OF REAL-TIME DATA USED FOR THE PAPER TRADING ALGO
   We do not currently leverage all the data sources we already have available.
   - Ensure Binance, MarketRegime, News, Deribit, BinanceLiquidations, Sanbase,
     Hyperliquid, etc. actually contribute factors (see SIGNAL_SOURCES.md).
   - Confirm in logs: at startup [VINCE] 📡 Signal sources available: N/8 (...);
     on each aggregation use LOG_LEVEL=debug to see VinceSignalAggregator per-asset contribution.
   - Use LOG_LEVEL=debug to see "tried but no contribution" for sources that ran
     but didn’t meet thresholds (e.g. taker ratio 0.7–1.3, neutral regime).
     ✅ Extended: BinanceLiquidations, Sanbase, Hyperliquid now also reported in
     triedNoContribution when they run but don’t add a factor (see signalAggregator).
   - Populate MandoMinutes cache for News; consider relaxing or tuning thresholds
     so more sources contribute more often.

================================================================================
IN PROGRESS
================================================================================

🔄 Paper trading bot needs more trades to tune Thompson Sampling weights
   → Use VINCE_PAPER_AGGRESSIVE=true ($280 TP, 2:1 R:R, 40x, no cooldown) and VINCE_PAPER_ASSETS=BTC (focus BTC first) to get more trades and JSONL for ML.
🔄 Feature store: 90+ trades available; ONNX training runs automatically (TRAIN_ONNX_WHEN_READY) or manually: python3 src/plugins/plugin-vince/scripts/train_models.py --data .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/features --output .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/models --min-samples 90. Install: pip3 install onnx onnxmltools.
🔄 No improvement suggestions generated yet (needs more trading data)
🔄 Increase real-time signal factors: get more sources contributing (see PRIORITY above)

MCP / ELIZA CLOUD – LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITIES
================================================================================
(Ref: https://www.elizacloud.ai/ MCP catalog – serverless, x402 micropayments, SSE/HTTP)

📋 ElizaOS Cloud MCP (v1.0.0 – 20 tools) – Platform
   Use for: credit management, AI generation, memory, conversations, agent interaction.
   - VINCE relevance: Offload heavy or rate-limited calls (e.g. when Binance 451);
     use Cloud memory/conversations for cross-session context; credit-based usage
     fits cost visibility in logs/deploy (see “Improve logs for Eliza Cloud”).
   - Action: Evaluate wiring plugin-vince to Cloud MCP for memory/credits when
     deploying to Eliza Cloud; document credit impact of signal aggregator + HL/Binance.

📋 Time & Date MCP (v2.0.0 – 5 tools) – Utilities
   Use for: current time, timezone conversion, date calculations.
   - VINCE relevance: Session filters (Asia/EU/US overlap) and day-of-week logic
     (Lifestyle, paper trading confidence/size) already use local time; MCP could
     provide canonical “market open” / timezone for multi-region users and logs.
   - Action: Optional integration in VinceLifestyleService or signal aggregator
     for time-aware summaries; single source of truth for “market session” in logs.

📋 Weather MCP (v2.0.0 – 4 tools) – Data
   Use for: real-time weather, 16-day forecast, location search (Open-Meteo).
   - VINCE relevance: Lifestyle action (dining, hotel, activities); day-of-week
     suggestions could be weather-aware (e.g. indoor vs outdoor by location).
   - Action: Backlog – add Weather MCP as optional Lifestyle enrichment when
     user shares location or for curated “today’s vibe” in GM/Aloha.

📋 Crypto Price MCP (v2.0.0 – 3 tools) – Finance, Free
   Use for: live prices, market cap, trending coins (CoinGecko).
   - VINCE relevance: We already use CoinGecko (VinceCoinGeckoService), HIP-3,
     Hyperliquid. MCP could be fallback or secondary source for “trending” and
     simple price checks without maintaining our own rate limits.
   - Action: Backlog – consider Crypto Price MCP as optional fallback for
     meme/trending or for lightweight price context in actions (cost: free).

General: Adopting MCPs can reduce in-plugin API surface and centralize credits/cost
on Eliza Cloud; log MCP tool calls (tool name + credits if x402) for observability.

================================================================================
NEXT / BACKLOG
================================================================================

📋 Migrate prod to Supabase Postgres (POSTGRES_URL); then plugin_vince.paper_bot_features
   lives in same DB as ElizaOS tables (agents, memories, entities, rooms). See FEATURE-STORE.md.
🟢 Train ONNX when 90+ trades: task TRAIN_ONNX_WHEN_READY registered; runs on schedule (12h), max once per 24h; min-samples 90. Manual: pip3 install onnx onnxmltools && python3 src/plugins/plugin-vince/scripts/train_models.py --data .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/features --output .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/models --min-samples 90. Exports signal_quality.onnx, position_sizing.onnx, tp_optimizer.onnx, sl_optimizer.onnx.
📋 Add more NFT collections to floor tracking
📋 Implement ClawdBot integration for self-healing (see WHY.md)
📋 Add Telegram/Discord notifications for alerts
📋 Add more meme tokens to constants
📋 Implement position sizing based on Kelly Criterion ML model
📋 Add correlation-based position limits
📋 Implement trailing stop-loss logic

Product feedback → backlog:
📋 NEWS: Build own news plugin + day report to reduce MandoMinutes dependency (likely X API ~$100/mo).
📋 MEMES: Fix bold styling in UI (quick fix; looks messy). Improve quality over time (not top priority).
📋 BOT: Polish BOT command—easier on the eyes, consistent writing style with other actions.
📋 INTEL: Address redundancy with GM / Aloha (merge or differentiate).
📋 UPLOAD / knowledge: Improve upload flow for YouTube, long PDFs, long articles → RAG; high priority. Consider dedicated ClawdBot (Moltbot) for this.
📋 LIFESTYLE: More focus on curated local (hotel/restaurant/spa/health/fitness); may migrate to dedicated CLAWDBOT.
📋 NFT: Continue improving floor/tracking; solid MVP, "thin floor" gems from iconic collections still valued.

================================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

⚠️ XAI/Grok requires API key (not all users will have)
⚠️ Nansen limited to 100 credits/month
⚠️ Sanbase limited to 1K calls/month
⚠️ Paper bot circuit breakers not yet validated with real trading
⚠️ ONNX inference active when .onnx files present in models dir; install onnxmltools and run train_models.py to generate them (feature names f0,f1,… applied at export for converter)
⚠️ Eliza Cloud deploy (vince2) timed out after 15 min; 15 credits were deducted
   (see DEPLOYMENT section below)

================================================================================
SUPABASE / STORAGE
================================================================================

We added this clarification so it’s recorded in progress.txt:

- **POSTGRES_URL (Supabase Postgres)** = main app database. ElizaOS (plugin-sql) uses it for conversation/message storage, agent memory, entities, rooms, relationships, tasks, cache, and knowledge embeddings. So Supabase is used for memory storage of conversations and all other runtime persistence. Required for persistent deploy; without it the app uses local PGLite.
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY / SUPABASE_URL** = optional. Used only for the feature store: paper-bot feature records are upserted to table `vince_paper_bot_features` so you can query 500+ rows for ML training. See FEATURE-STORE.md. Not needed for conversation/memory; that goes through POSTGRES_URL.

================================================================================
DEPLOYMENT (Eliza Cloud)
================================================================================

Current prod:
- Repo pushed to prod with Eliza Cloud; everything works fine.
- Still on PGLite (no POSTGRES_URL yet). Next step: migrate to Supabase Postgres
  so ElizaOS tables (agents, memories, entities, rooms, etc.) and
  plugin_vince.paper_bot_features live in the same Supabase DB. See FEATURE-STORE.md
  for how feature-store jsonl fits with ElizaOS auto-generated tables.

2026-02-02 – vince2 deploy timeout (historical):
- Command: elizaos deploy --project-name vince2 (with ANTHROPIC, OPENAI, POSTGRES_URL)
- Credits: 15 deducted when container was created (before health check)
- Container created: 0983fab1-1756-4008-8f7c-c7592aa9c915
- Outcome: CLI reported "Deployment failed" – timeout after 15 minutes waiting for
  container to pass health check (/health returning 200). Container may still exist
  or still be deploying.
- Dashboard: https://www.elizacloud.ai/dashboard/containers/0983fab1-1756-4008-8f7c-c7592aa9c915
- Next steps:
  1. Check status: elizaos containers list
  2. View logs: elizaos containers logs --project-name vince2 --tail 200
  3. Ensure app returns 200 OK at /health (required for deploy success)
  4. If deploy never became usable: contact Eliza Cloud support to request
     credit restoration for timed-out deployment (15 credits)

================================================================================
BRANDING, CHANNELS & X (TWITTER)
================================================================================

Frontend / branding (Eliza Cloud):
- The current frontend we have deployed through Eliza Cloud is fine for now but
  is very much NOT on brand with IKIGAI LABS and IKIGAI STUDIO.
- Intent: internal use only. Do NOT promote this deployment; it is for our team
  and community ops, not as a public-facing product.

Channel strategy – “where the community is”:
- We are super bullish on being where the users are (in our case, the community).
  Hence our focus order:
  1. DISCORD FIRST: Primary channel. Connect Discord servers for AI-powered
     automation (announcements, app updates, rich embeds, scheduled posts).
     Eliza Cloud Settings → Discord Bot is the first integration we use.
  2. TELEGRAM SECOND: Connect Telegram bot for automation (channels, auto-reply
     in groups, welcome messages, /help and /about). Available in Eliza Cloud
     Settings → Connections (Bot Token from @BotFather).
- Upcoming features (Eliza Cloud) we may or may not use:
  - Bluesky (Coming Soon) – cross-platform automation.
  - LinkedIn (Coming Soon) – professional content automation.
  - Meta Ads (Coming Soon) – Facebook & Instagram campaigns.
  No commitment yet; evaluate when live.

X (Twitter) integration – second thoughts:
- X integration feels like the most important channel from a reach perspective,
  but we have serious reservations due to backstory:
  - Most ElizaOS bots got banned on X.
  - The original ElizaOS (ai16z at the time) also got banned; they had to
    rebrand (including due to lawsuit) – so the ecosystem has direct experience
    with X enforcement against agent/bot accounts.
- Outcome: We are not prioritizing X integration for now. Internal use and
  community focus (Discord, then Telegram) avoid that risk. Revisit X only if
  we have a clear, low-risk path (e.g. official partnerships or policy change).

================================================================================
SESSION NOTES
================================================================================

2026-02-03:
- MCP / Eliza Cloud: New section “MCP / ELIZA CLOUD – LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITIES” in
  progress.txt with concrete suggestions: ElizaOS Cloud MCP (credits, memory,
  agent interaction), Time & Date (session/tz), Weather (Lifestyle), Crypto Price
  (fallback/trending). Each tied to plugin-vince use case and backlog action.
- Eliza Cloud logs: (1) VinceBinance HTTP 451 – DONE (binance.service.ts: logHttpWarn
  with 5-min cooldown, 451 context, debug for repeats). (2) General log improvements
  for elizacloud.ai remain in PRIORITY (filterable levels, less noise, high-signal summaries).
- Signal sources: startup log [VINCE] 📡 Signal sources available: N/8 (...); aggregator
  INFO logs list which sources contributed; DEBUG "tried but no contribution" for
  Binance, NewsSentiment, DeribitIVSkew, MarketRegime; extended to BinanceLiquidations,
  Sanbase, Hyperliquid when they run but don’t add a factor (signalAggregator). See SIGNAL_SOURCES.md.
- ONNX training when 90+ trades: getCompleteRecordCount() on feature store; TRAIN_ONNX_WHEN_READY task runs on schedule (12h), max once per 24h; spawns train_models.py --min-samples 90. FEATURE-STORE.md updated.
- README (repo + plugin): Heart of VINCE, signal-source verification, improvement report.
- FEATURE-STORE.md: current prod state (Eliza Cloud, PGLite); ElizaOS tables vs feature
  store; jsonl lives in plugin_vince.paper_bot_features (same DB when Postgres), not
  in core ElizaOS tables. Optional Supabase table for ML queries.
- progress.txt: PRIORITY = improve real-time data for paper algo (leverage all sources);
  deployment note (prod works, still PGLite; next Supabase Postgres); NEXT = migrate
  to Supabase Postgres, then feature store in same DB as ElizaOS tables.
- Product feedback: README "Action status (honest take)" added (OPTIONS/PERPS gold; NEWS
  MandoMinutes dependency; MEMES/TREADFI/LIFESTYLE/NFT/INTEL/BOT/UPLOAD). Backlog items
  added for news plugin, MEMES UI bold fix, BOT polish, INTEL redundancy, UPLOAD/knowledge,
  LIFESTYLE→CLAWDBOT, NFT improvements.
- More trades for ML: Aggressive paper-trading preset (VINCE_PAPER_AGGRESSIVE=true → $210
  take profit, max leverage 10) and single-asset focus (VINCE_PAPER_ASSETS=BTC → bot only
  trades BTC) added. Goal: more closed trades → more JSONL in .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/features
  → faster path to 90+ records for ONNX training and better ML script testing. See
  FEATURE-STORE.md “Aggressive paper trading” and “Paper bot: focus on one asset”; .env.example.
- Strong-signal confirming override: We need more training data, so more trades (and higher
  leverage where appropriate). Bot was correctly requiring 3 confirming sources for BTC, but
  was blocking strong signals (e.g. 65% strength, 67% confidence) that had only 2 agreeing
  sources. Added MIN_CONFIRMING_WHEN_STRONG=2 in paperTradingDefaults (SIGNAL_THRESHOLDS):
  when strength >= STRONG_STRENGTH (60) and confidence >= HIGH_CONFIDENCE (55), allow 2
  confirming signals instead of 3. Risk manager uses this in validateSignal(); HYPE still
  uses 2 always. Tuning this constant (or the strength/confidence bar) controls trade
  frequency vs. confluence. See vinceRiskManager.service.ts and paperTradingDefaults.ts.
- Paper trading aggressive preset – R:R and risk tuning: SL was ATR-based only, often giving
  poor R:R (0.4:1–0.5:1). We now set SL from target R:R so max loss = TP / TARGET_RR. Constants
  in paperTradingDefaults: TARGET_RR_AGGRESSIVE=2, TAKE_PROFIT_USD_AGGRESSIVE=280, MIN_SL_PCT_
  AGGRESSIVE=0.35, MAX_SL_PCT_AGGRESSIVE=1.5, MIN_SL_ATR_MULTIPLIER_AGGRESSIVE=0.5. Logic in
  vincePaperTrading.service.ts openTrade(): (1) Aggressive single-TP: SL% = (TP/2)/sizeUsd*100
  clamped to [0.35%, 1.5%]; (2) volatility floor: if ATR available, SL% = max(SL%, 0.5×ATR) then
  cap at 1.5% so we never put the stop inside normal chop; (3) banner shows R:R quality label
  (Good/OK/Weak/Poor) and TP as [$280]. Result: 2:1 R:R, $280 TP, $140 risk; fewer trades
  needed for daily target; no cooldown after loss in aggressive (AGGRESSIVE_RISK_LIMITS.cooldownAfterLossMs=0).
  Trade-opened banner was also cleaned up (fixed-width lines, section labels, spacing).
- Fetch performance (important): (1) Coinglass: all HTTP fetches use AbortSignal.timeout(10s); refreshData() fetches all assets + fear/greed in parallel; fetchCoinGlassData runs OI, funding, Binance L/S in parallel per asset; fetchFreeData runs price, funding, L/S, OI history in one Promise.all. (2) Signal aggregator: added SOURCE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS=12s and withTimeout(ms, label, promise) helper; phase-1 async sources (Binance getIntelligence, Deribit getIVSurface, MarketData getEnrichedContext, Sanbase getOnChainContext, Hyperliquid getOptionsPulse + getCrossVenueFunding, Deribit getComprehensiveData + getVolatilityIndex) are fetched in a single Promise.all with per-call timeout; sections 3–10 use these pre-fetched results instead of sequential awaits. Phase-2 calls (getTakerVolume, getRSIAdjustment, getOpenWindowInfo) wrapped in withTimeout. getAllSignals() now uses Promise.all(assets.map(getSignal)) so multi-asset aggregation is parallel. Result:   aggregation time bounded by slowest source (~12s max) instead of sum of many sequential calls.
- Scripts and ONNX: (1) Switched ONNX export from skl2onnx to onnxmltools (XGBoost not supported by skl2onnx). (2) Export failed until booster feature names set to f0, f1, … before convert_xgboost (onnxmltools requires that pattern). (3) All four .onnx models now export when pip3 install onnx onnxmltools. (4) Docs and log messages use pip3 (Mac). (5) generate_synthetic_features.py: --append to extend existing JSONL (timestamps continue), optional larger --count; train_models loads all synthetic_*.jsonl in --data dir.    (6) test_train_models.py: 6 tests pass (generate→train, learning baseline, insufficient data, SL label, multi-asset). (7) requirements.txt: onnxmltools>=1.16.0, no skl2onnx; install note: pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
- progress.txt: This file updated to reflect completed ONNX export (onnxmltools, f0/f1 feature names), synthetic data (--append, --count), and test_train_models.py (6 tests). ML inference service uses session.run({ input: tensor }) and results.output; ONNX models exported by train_models use default onnxmltools input/output names (compatible).
- Eliza Cloud logs: INFO noise reduced. Signal aggregator (per-asset contribution), Coinglass dashboard, Hyperliquid OPTIONS PULSE → debug. Paper trading sizing details (correlation, DVOL, regime, session, streak, ML) → debug. CROSS-VENUE arb stays INFO when arb opportunities. .env.example: tip added for VINCE_PAPER_AGGRESSIVE + VINCE_PAPER_ASSETS=BTC to get more trades for ML.

2026-02-02:
- Created progress.txt
- Finetuned START.md to be VINCE/ElizaOS specific
- Verified documentation stack (WHAT, WHY, HOW, CLAUDE, START)
- Plugin has 27 services, 20 actions, 2 providers, 1 evaluator
- ML layer collecting features, awaiting sufficient data for training
- Eliza Cloud deploy (vince2) timed out; 15 credits deducted; documented above
- Documented Supabase usage in progress.txt: POSTGRES_URL = main app DB (conversations, memory, entities, rooms, embeddings). Optional SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = feature store (vince_paper_bot_features) for ML only. See FEATURE-STORE.md for feature-store setup.
