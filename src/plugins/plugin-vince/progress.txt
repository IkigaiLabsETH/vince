================================================================================
PRIORITY (real-time data for paper trading algo)
================================================================================

🔴 IMPROVE THE AMOUNT OF REAL-TIME DATA USED FOR THE PAPER TRADING ALGO
   We do not currently leverage all the data sources we already have available.
   - Ensure Binance, MarketRegime, News, Deribit, BinanceLiquidations, Sanbase,
     Hyperliquid, etc. actually contribute factors (see SIGNAL_SOURCES.md).
   - Confirm in logs: at startup [VINCE] 📡 Signal sources available: N/8 (...);
     on each aggregation [VinceSignalAggregator] ASSET: N source(s) → M factors | Sources: ...
   - Use LOG_LEVEL=debug to see "tried but no contribution" for sources that ran
     but didn’t meet thresholds (e.g. taker ratio 0.7–1.3, neutral regime).
   - Populate MandoMinutes cache for News; consider relaxing or tuning thresholds
     so more sources contribute more often.

================================================================================
IN PROGRESS
================================================================================

🔄 Paper trading bot needs more trades to tune Thompson Sampling weights
🔄 Feature store needs 90+ trades for ONNX model training
🔄 No improvement suggestions generated yet (needs more trading data)
🔄 Increase real-time signal factors: get more sources contributing (see PRIORITY above)

================================================================================
NEXT / BACKLOG
================================================================================

📋 Migrate prod to Supabase Postgres (POSTGRES_URL); then plugin_vince.paper_bot_features
   lives in same DB as ElizaOS tables (agents, memories, entities, rooms). See FEATURE-STORE.md.
📋 Train ONNX models when feature store reaches 90+ trades
📋 Add more NFT collections to floor tracking
📋 Implement ClawdBot integration for self-healing (see WHY.md)
📋 Add Telegram/Discord notifications for alerts
📋 Add more meme tokens to constants
📋 Implement position sizing based on Kelly Criterion ML model
📋 Add correlation-based position limits
📋 Implement trailing stop-loss logic

Product feedback → backlog:
📋 NEWS: Build own news plugin + day report to reduce MandoMinutes dependency (likely X API ~$100/mo).
📋 MEMES: Fix bold styling in UI (quick fix; looks messy). Improve quality over time (not top priority).
📋 BOT: Polish BOT command—easier on the eyes, consistent writing style with other actions.
📋 INTEL: Address redundancy with GM / Aloha (merge or differentiate).
📋 UPLOAD / knowledge: Improve upload flow for YouTube, long PDFs, long articles → RAG; high priority. Consider dedicated ClawdBot (Moltbot) for this.
📋 LIFESTYLE: More focus on curated local (hotel/restaurant/spa/health/fitness); may migrate to dedicated CLAWDBOT.
📋 NFT: Continue improving floor/tracking; solid MVP, "thin floor" gems from iconic collections still valued.

================================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

⚠️ XAI/Grok requires API key (not all users will have)
⚠️ Nansen limited to 100 credits/month
⚠️ Sanbase limited to 1K calls/month
⚠️ Paper bot circuit breakers not yet validated with real trading
⚠️ ONNX inference not yet active (needs training data)
⚠️ Eliza Cloud deploy (vince2) timed out after 15 min; 15 credits were deducted
   (see DEPLOYMENT section below)

================================================================================
SUPABASE / STORAGE
================================================================================

We added this clarification so it’s recorded in progress.txt:

- **POSTGRES_URL (Supabase Postgres)** = main app database. ElizaOS (plugin-sql) uses it for conversation/message storage, agent memory, entities, rooms, relationships, tasks, cache, and knowledge embeddings. So Supabase is used for memory storage of conversations and all other runtime persistence. Required for persistent deploy; without it the app uses local PGLite.
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY / SUPABASE_URL** = optional. Used only for the feature store: paper-bot feature records are upserted to table `vince_paper_bot_features` so you can query 500+ rows for ML training. See FEATURE-STORE.md. Not needed for conversation/memory; that goes through POSTGRES_URL.

================================================================================
DEPLOYMENT (Eliza Cloud)
================================================================================

Current prod:
- Repo pushed to prod with Eliza Cloud; everything works fine.
- Still on PGLite (no POSTGRES_URL yet). Next step: migrate to Supabase Postgres
  so ElizaOS tables (agents, memories, entities, rooms, etc.) and
  plugin_vince.paper_bot_features live in the same Supabase DB. See FEATURE-STORE.md
  for how feature-store jsonl fits with ElizaOS auto-generated tables.

2026-02-02 – vince2 deploy timeout (historical):
- Command: elizaos deploy --project-name vince2 (with ANTHROPIC, OPENAI, POSTGRES_URL)
- Credits: 15 deducted when container was created (before health check)
- Container created: 0983fab1-1756-4008-8f7c-c7592aa9c915
- Outcome: CLI reported "Deployment failed" – timeout after 15 minutes waiting for
  container to pass health check (/health returning 200). Container may still exist
  or still be deploying.
- Dashboard: https://www.elizacloud.ai/dashboard/containers/0983fab1-1756-4008-8f7c-c7592aa9c915
- Next steps:
  1. Check status: elizaos containers list
  2. View logs: elizaos containers logs --project-name vince2 --tail 200
  3. Ensure app returns 200 OK at /health (required for deploy success)
  4. If deploy never became usable: contact Eliza Cloud support to request
     credit restoration for timed-out deployment (15 credits)

================================================================================
SESSION NOTES
================================================================================

2026-02-03:
- Signal sources: startup log [VINCE] 📡 Signal sources available: N/8 (...); aggregator
  INFO logs list which sources contributed; DEBUG "tried but no contribution" for
  Binance, NewsSentiment, DeribitIVSkew, MarketRegime. See SIGNAL_SOURCES.md.
- README (repo + plugin): Heart of VINCE, signal-source verification, improvement report.
- FEATURE-STORE.md: current prod state (Eliza Cloud, PGLite); ElizaOS tables vs feature
  store; jsonl lives in plugin_vince.paper_bot_features (same DB when Postgres), not
  in core ElizaOS tables. Optional Supabase table for ML queries.
- progress.txt: PRIORITY = improve real-time data for paper algo (leverage all sources);
  deployment note (prod works, still PGLite; next Supabase Postgres); NEXT = migrate
  to Supabase Postgres, then feature store in same DB as ElizaOS tables.
- Product feedback: README "Action status (honest take)" added (OPTIONS/PERPS gold; NEWS
  MandoMinutes dependency; MEMES/TREADFI/LIFESTYLE/NFT/INTEL/BOT/UPLOAD). Backlog items
  added for news plugin, MEMES UI bold fix, BOT polish, INTEL redundancy, UPLOAD/knowledge,
  LIFESTYLE→CLAWDBOT, NFT improvements.

2026-02-02:
- Created progress.txt
- Finetuned START.md to be VINCE/ElizaOS specific
- Verified documentation stack (WHAT, WHY, HOW, CLAUDE, START)
- Plugin has 27 services, 20 actions, 2 providers, 1 evaluator
- ML layer collecting features, awaiting sufficient data for training
- Eliza Cloud deploy (vince2) timed out; 15 credits deducted; documented above
- Documented Supabase usage in progress.txt: POSTGRES_URL = main app DB (conversations, memory, entities, rooms, embeddings). Optional SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = feature store (vince_paper_bot_features) for ML only. See FEATURE-STORE.md for feature-store setup.
