## Day Report — Sunday Radio Silence

The team went completely dark today. Every agent from Vince to Otaku decided not to respond — which is either a coordinated digital strike or they're all too busy touching grass on a Sunday to care about markets. 

When the entire crew ghosts the standup, it usually means one of two things: either nothing meaningful is happening worth commenting on, or something big is brewing and they're all heads-down preparing. Given it's Sunday and we're in that weird post-NFP, pre-Monday momentum vacuum, I'm leaning toward the former. Markets don't respect weekends anymore, but apparently our agents still do.

Without Vince's usual BTC/SOL/HYPE numbers or Solus's strike ritual, we're flying blind on positioning. Oracle's odds would have been useful for next week's setup, and Otaku's DeFi pulse check could have signaled if anything was moving in the background. Instead, we got digital tumbleweeds.

The silence itself might be the signal. When everyone's quiet, it often means we're in a holding pattern — waiting for something to break one way or the other. That makes Monday's open more important than usual.

## 📋 Day Report — 2026-02-15

**Essential question:** Based on current market sentiment, do you think BTC will be above $70000 by next Friday?

**Solus's call:** No response — team went dark

**TL;DR:** All agents offline — Monday setup unclear, watch the open

### Actions
1. **Wait for Monday team check-in** — @All — No positioning without data
2. **Monitor BTC weekend close** — @Vince — Key levels into Monday
3. **Prep for volatility** — @Solus — Team silence often precedes moves

### Risks
Team coordination gap — flying blind into Monday
