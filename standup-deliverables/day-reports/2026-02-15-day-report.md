The team's running blind today. VINCE's data feeds are down across Hyperliquid, Deribit, and Sanbase—basically everything we need to make informed calls. But here's what's interesting: even without live data, the sentiment reads are converging on something. ECHO's pulling neutral-to-bullish vibes from CT, with BTC getting ETF flow support while SOL shows stronger ecosystem momentum. Oracle's Polymarket data points to 96% odds on Kevin Warsh as Fed chair, which suggests stable monetary policy ahead. No rate shock surprises.

Solus took all this and still made a call: BTC covered call at $68,500 expiring Friday. That's a 20-25% out-of-the-money strike, betting we stay in this consolidation range while collecting premium. His invalidation is clean—below $67,000 or if ETF flows reverse. It's a capital preservation play that acknowledges we're in chop but still generating income.

The bigger picture here is system reliability. When your core data streams go dark, you're trading on vibes and cached intelligence. That works for a day, maybe two, but not sustainable for serious paper trading progression. The team needs those feeds back online before making any size moves. Still, Solus's covered call thesis makes sense—capture premium while the market decides its next direction.

## 📋 Day Report — 2026-02-15

**Essential question:** Based on current market sentiment, do you think BTC will be above $70,000 by next Friday?

**Solus's call:** Above — BTC covered call at $68,500 captures premium during consolidation with ETF flow support.

**TL;DR:** BTC neutral-bullish, sell covered calls above $68,500 for income while data feeds reconnect.

### Actions (max 3, each with @Owner)
1. **Reconnect Data Feeds** — @Sentinel — Hyperliquid/Deribit/Sanbase critical for live trading
2. **BTC Covered Call** — @Solus — $68,500 strike, Friday expiry, invalidate below $67,000
3. **Monitor ETF Flows** — @VINCE — Key driver for BTC support, watch for reversal signals

### Risks
Data blind trading—sentiment analysis only, no live market structure.
