The team's reading today is pretty straightforward: Bitcoin's stuck in neutral while Solana's stealing all the attention. VINCE's data shows BTC sentiment at a lukewarm +12 while SOL's running hot at +35, which usually means one of two things—either SOL's about to rip higher or we're setting up for a pullback when everyone's positioned the same way. Oracle's throwing some interesting context with Kevin Warsh's Fed nomination sitting at 96% odds, which suggests the market's pricing in stable monetary policy ahead. That's actually bullish for risk assets longer term, but right now it's keeping BTC range-bound.

Solus is playing this perfectly with the covered call strategy. Selling the $68,500 strike on Friday expiry captures 2-3% premium while BTC churns sideways. The invalidation at $67,000 gives enough room for normal volatility without getting stopped out. What's smart here is recognizing that when sentiment's this split—neutral on the king, bullish on everything else—you want to sell premium rather than chase direction. The AI infrastructure narrative that Clawterm's picking up supports this view. Developers are building faster, markets are consolidating, and the real action might be in the ecosystem plays rather than the majors. Sometimes the best trade is the boring one that pays you to wait.
