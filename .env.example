### elizaOS Environment Variables ###
# To get started, copy this file to .env, or make a .env and add the settings you'd like to override
# Please read the comments for each of the configurations

# The only thing you ABSOLUTELY NEED to get up and running is one of the model provider keys, 
# i.e. OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or setup the local-ai plugin
# Everything else is optional, and most settings and secrets can be configured in your agent or through the GUI
# For multi-agent, each agent will need keys for the various services it is connected to
# You can use the .env or environment variables generally for shared keys, such as to model providers, 
# database, etc, with scoped keys for services such as Telegram, Discord, etc

### MODEL PROVIDER KEYS ###
# Eliza is compatible with a wide array of model providers. Many have OpenAI compatible APIs, 
# and you can use them by overriding the base URL

# NOTE: You will need a provider that provides embeddings. So even if you use Claude, you will 
# need to get embeddings using another provider, for example openai or our local-ai plugin

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=
# Use this to override the openai endpoint, for example for using together.ai, fireworks or other providers
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=

# Anthropic Configuration
# By default in most of our starter kits, Anthropic will take precedence over OpenAI in handling requests
# Anthropic does not handle embeddings, so you may wish to use OpenAI for that, even while Claude is handling text generation
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# Cloudflare AI

### DATABASE ###
# By default, Eliza will use a local pglite instance
# If you fill out POSTGRES_URL, the agent will connect to your postgres instance instead of using the local path

# You can override the pglite data directory
# PGLITE_DATA_DIR=/Users/UserName/eliza/packages/.pglite/

# Postgres (Supabase etc.): use DIRECT connection (port 5432), not pooler (6543), or migrations fail.
# Add sslmode=verify-full to avoid SSL warnings; Supabase: postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@db.XXX.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=verify-full
POSTGRES_URL=
# If you get "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" with Supabase/Postgres, set to false (opt-in; use only if needed):
# POSTGRES_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false

# VINCE paper-bot: aggressive mode. Higher leverage, $280 TP, 2:1 R:R, and only 2 confirming signals (vs 3).
# Set to true for more trades → more ML training data.
# VINCE_PAPER_AGGRESSIVE=true

# VINCE paper-bot: which assets to trade. BTC only (focus on best signals first), or comma-separated list.
# VINCE_PAPER_ASSETS=BTC
# Tip: Uncomment both above for more closed trades → more JSONL for ONNX/ML (see progress.txt / FEATURE-STORE.md).

# When true, plugin init reads training_metadata.json and aligns aggregator source weights with feature_importances (THINGS TO DO #3).
# VINCE_APPLY_IMPROVEMENT_WEIGHTS=true

# Binance Futures API base URL. Set to a proxy URL in 451/geo-restricted regions (e.g. https://your-proxy.com/binance). No trailing slash.
# VINCE_BINANCE_BASE_URL=https://fapi.binance.com

# VINCE paper-bot feature store → Supabase (for ML; see FEATURE-STORE.md)
# Same records as local .elizadb/vince-paper-bot/features/*.jsonl are upserted here so you can query 500+ for ML.
# SUPABASE_URL is optional if POSTGRES_URL is Supabase (derived from db.XXX.supabase.co).
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
# SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

### LOGGING CONFIGURATION ###
# Logging: fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace (default: info)
# Use LOG_LEVEL=warn for quiet terminal – boxes, warnings, errors only (no routine Info)

### API KEYS ###
# Many services require API keys to function
# Most plugins will indicate what is needed in their README.md and throw helpful errors if they are missing

### SINGLE AGENT VARIABLES ###
# If you are running multiple agents, you will need to configure these variables in the agent secrets 
# (available in the GUI) OR you can namespace the secrets and connect them up in your character definition

# Example: 
# settings: {
#   process.env.COMMUNITY_MANAGER_DISCORD_API_TOKEN
# }
